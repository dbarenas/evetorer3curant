Banking in the modern sense of the word can be traced to medieval and early
_R_e_n_a_i_s_s_a_n_c_e _I_t_a_l_y, to the rich cities in the north like _F_l_o_r_e_n_c_e, _L_u_c_c_a, _S_i_e_n_a,

century Florence, establishing branches in many other parts of _E_u_r_o_p_e._[_2_] One

The word bank was borrowed in _M_i_d_d_l_e_ _E_n_g_l_i_s_h from _M_i_d_d_l_e_ _F_r_e_n_c_h banque, from

One of the oldest items found showing money-changing activity is a silver Greek
drachm coin from ancient Hellenic colony Trapezus on the Black Sea, modern
_T_r_a_b_z_o_n, c. 350â325 BC, presented in the _B_r_i_t_i_s_h_ _M_u_s_e_u_m in London. The coin
shows a banker's table (trapeza) laden with coins, a pun on the name of the
city. In fact, even today in _M_o_d_e_r_n_ _G_r_e_e_k the word Trapeza (Î¤ÏÎ¬ÏÎµÎ¶Î±)
means both a table and a bank.

Under _E_n_g_l_i_s_h_ _c_o_m_m_o_n_ _l_a_w, a banker is defined as a person who carries on the

In most common law jurisdictions there is a Bills of Exchange Act that codifies
the law in relation to _n_e_g_o_t_i_a_b_l_e_ _i_n_s_t_r_u_m_e_n_t_s, including _c_h_e_q_u_e_s, and this Act
contains a statutory definition of the term banker: banker includes a body of
persons, whether incorporated or not, who carry on the business of banking'
(Section 2, Interpretation). Although this definition seems circular, it is
actually functional, because it ensures that the legal basis for bank
transactions such as cheques does not depend on how the bank is organized or
regulated.
The business of banking is in many _E_n_g_l_i_s_h_ _c_o_m_m_o_n_ _l_a_w countries not defined by
statute but by common law, the definition above. In other English common law
jurisdictions there are statutory definitions of the business of banking or
banking business. When looking at these definitions it is important to keep in
mind that they are defining the business of banking for the purposes of the
legislation, and not necessarily in general. In particular, most of the
definitions are from legislation that has the purposes of entry regulating and
supervising banks rather than regulating the actual business of banking.
However, in many cases the statutory definition closely mirrors the common law
one. Examples of statutory definitions:
    * "banking business" means the business of receiving money on current or
      deposit account, paying and collecting cheques drawn by or paid in by
      customers, the making of advances to customers, and includes such other
      business as the Authority may prescribe for the purposes of this Act;
      (Banking Act (Singapore), Section 2, Interpretation).
    * "banking business" means the business of either or both of the following:
   1. receiving from the general public money on current, deposit, savings or
      other similar account repayable on demand or within less than [3 months]
      ... or with a period of call or notice of less than that period;
   2. paying or collecting checks drawn by or paid in by customers._[_9_]
Since the advent of _E_F_T_P_O_S (Electronic Funds Transfer at Point Of Sale), direct
credit, _d_i_r_e_c_t_ _d_e_b_i_t and _i_n_t_e_r_n_e_t_ _b_a_n_k_i_n_g, the cheque has lost its primacy in
most banking systems as a payment instrument. This has led legal theorists to
suggest that the cheque based definition should be broadened to include
financial institutions that conduct current accounts for customers and enable
customers to pay and be paid by third parties, even if they do not pay and
collect checks._[_1_0_]

Banks act as payment agents by conducting _c_h_e_c_k_i_n_g_ _o_r_ _c_u_r_r_e_n_t_ _a_c_c_o_u_n_t_s for
customers, paying _c_h_e_q_u_e_s drawn by customers on the bank, and collecting
cheques deposited to customers' current accounts. Banks also enable customer
payments via other payment methods such as _A_u_t_o_m_a_t_e_d_ _C_l_e_a_r_i_n_g_ _H_o_u_s_e (ACH), _W_i_r_e
_t_r_a_n_s_f_e_r_s or _t_e_l_e_g_r_a_p_h_i_c_ _t_r_a_n_s_f_e_r, _E_F_T_P_O_S, and _a_u_t_o_m_a_t_e_d_ _t_e_l_l_e_r_ _m_a_c_h_i_n_e (ATM).
Banks borrow money by accepting funds deposited on current accounts, by
accepting _t_e_r_m_ _d_e_p_o_s_i_t_s, and by issuing debt securities such as _b_a_n_k_n_o_t_e_s and
_b_o_n_d_s. Banks lend money by making advances to customers on current accounts, by
making _i_n_s_t_a_l_l_m_e_n_t_ _l_o_a_n_s, and by investing in marketable debt securities and
other forms of money lending.
Banks provide different payment services, and a bank account is considered
indispensable by most businesses and individuals. Non-banks that provide
payment services such as remittance companies are normally not considered as an
adequate substitute for a bank account.
Banks can create new money when they make a loan. New loans throughout the
banking system generate new deposits elsewhere in the system. The money supply
is usually increased by the act of lending, and reduced when loans are repaid
faster than new ones are generated. In the United Kingdom between 1997 and
2007, there was a big increase in the money supply, largely caused by much more
bank lending, which served to push up property prices and increase private
debt. The amount of money in the economy as measured by M4 in the UK went from
Â£750 billion to Â£1700 billion between 1997 and 2007, much of the increase
caused by bank lending. _[_1_1_] If all the banks increase their lending together,
then they can expect new deposits to return to them and the amount of money in
the economy will increase. Excessive or risky lending can cause borrowers to
default, the banks then become more cautious, so there is less lending and
therefore less money so that the economy can go from boom to bust as happened
in the UK and many other Western economies after 2007.

A bank can generate revenue in a variety of different ways including interest,
transaction fees and financial advice. The main method is via charging _i_n_t_e_r_e_s_t
on the capital it lends out to customers.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] The bank profits
from the difference between the level of interest it pays for deposits and
other sources of funds, and the level of interest it charges in its lending
activities.
This difference is referred to as the _s_p_r_e_a_d between the cost of funds and the
loan interest rate. Historically, profitability from lending activities has
been cyclical and dependent on the needs and strengths of loan customers and
the stage of the _e_c_o_n_o_m_i_c_ _c_y_c_l_e. Fees and financial advice constitute a more
stable revenue stream and banks have therefore placed more emphasis on these
revenue lines to smooth their financial performance.
In the past 20 years American banks have taken many measures to ensure that
they remain profitable while responding to increasingly changing market
conditions. First, this includes the _G_r_a_m_m_-_L_e_a_c_h_-_B_l_i_l_e_y_ _A_c_t, which allows banks
again to merge with investment and insurance houses. Merging banking,
investment, and insurance functions allows traditional banks to respond to
increasing consumer demands for "one-stop shopping" by enabling cross-selling
of products (which, the banks hope, will also increase profitability).
Second, they have expanded the use of _r_i_s_k_-_b_a_s_e_d_ _p_r_i_c_i_n_g from business lending
to consumer lending, which means charging higher interest rates to those
customers that are considered to be a higher credit risk and thus increased
chance of _d_e_f_a_u_l_t on loans. This helps to offset the losses from bad loans,
lowers the price of loans to those who have better credit histories, and offers
credit products to high risk customers who would otherwise be denied credit.
Third, they have sought to increase the methods of payment processing available
to the general public and business clients. These products include _d_e_b_i_t_ _c_a_r_d_s,
prepaid cards, _s_m_a_r_t_ _c_a_r_d_s, and _c_r_e_d_i_t_ _c_a_r_d_s. They make it easier for consumers
to conveniently make transactions and smooth their consumption over time (in
some countries with underdeveloped financial systems, it is still common to
deal strictly in cash, including carrying suitcases filled with cash to
purchase a home).
However, with convenience of easy credit, there is also increased risk that
consumers will mismanage their financial resources and accumulate excessive
debt. Banks make money from card products through interest payments and fees
charged to consumers and _t_r_a_n_s_a_c_t_i_o_n_ _f_e_e_s to companies that accept the credit-
debit - cards. This helps in making profit and facilitates economic development
as a whole._[_1_2_]

Banks face a number of _r_i_s_k_s in order to conduct their business, and how well
these risks are managed and understood is a key driver behind profitability,
and how much _c_a_p_i_t_a_l a bank is required to hold. Some of the main risks faced
by banks include:
    * _C_r_e_d_i_t_ _r_i_s_k: risk of loss[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] arising from a borrower who

    * _L_i_q_u_i_d_i_t_y_ _r_i_s_k: risk that a given security or asset cannot be traded
      quickly enough in the market to prevent a loss (or make the required
      profit).
    * _M_a_r_k_e_t_ _r_i_s_k: risk that the value of a portfolio, either an investment

      value of the market risk factors.
    * _O_p_e_r_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _r_i_s_k: risk arising from execution of a company's business

The economic functions of banks include:
   1. Issue of money, in the form of _b_a_n_k_n_o_t_e_s and current accounts subject to
      _c_h_e_c_k or payment at the customer's order. These claims on banks can act
      as money because they are negotiable or repayable on demand, and hence
      valued at par. They are effectively transferable by mere delivery, in the
      case of banknotes, or by drawing a check that the payee may bank or cash.
   2. Netting and settlement of payments â banks act as both collection and
      paying agents for customers, participating in interbank clearing and
      settlement systems to collect, present, be presented with, and pay
      payment instruments. This enables banks to economize on reserves held for
      settlement of payments, since inward and outward payments offset each
      other. It also enables the offsetting of payment flows between
      geographical areas, reducing the cost of settlement between them.
   3. Credit intermediation â banks borrow and lend back-to-back on their own
      account as middle men.
   4. Credit quality improvement â banks lend money to ordinary commercial
      and personal borrowers (ordinary credit quality), but are high quality
      borrowers. The improvement comes from diversification of the bank's
      assets and capital which provides a buffer to absorb losses without
      defaulting on its obligations. However, banknotes and deposits are
      generally unsecured; if the bank gets into difficulty and pledges assets
      as security, to raise the funding it needs to continue to operate, this
      puts the note holders and depositors in an economically subordinated
      position.
   5. _A_s_s_e_t_ _l_i_a_b_i_l_i_t_y_ _m_i_s_m_a_t_c_h/_M_a_t_u_r_i_t_y_ _t_r_a_n_s_f_o_r_m_a_t_i_o_n â banks borrow more on
      demand debt and short term debt, but provide more long term loans. In
      other words, they borrow short and lend long. With a stronger credit
      quality than most other borrowers, banks can do this by aggregating
      issues (e.g. accepting deposits and issuing banknotes) and redemptions
      (e.g. withdrawals and redemption of banknotes), maintaining reserves of
      cash, investing in marketable securities that can be readily converted to
      cash if needed, and raising replacement funding as needed from various
      sources (e.g. wholesale cash markets and securities markets).
   6. _M_o_n_e_y_ _c_r_e_a_t_i_o_n â whenever a bank gives out a loan in a _f_r_a_c_t_i_o_n_a_l_-

Banks are susceptible to many forms of risk which have triggered occasional
systemic crises. These include _l_i_q_u_i_d_i_t_y_ _r_i_s_k (where many depositors may
request withdrawals in excess of available funds), _c_r_e_d_i_t_ _r_i_s_k (the chance that
those who owe money to the bank will not repay it), and _i_n_t_e_r_e_s_t_ _r_a_t_e_ _r_i_s_k (the
possibility that the bank will become unprofitable, if rising interest rates
force it to pay relatively more on its deposits than it receives on its loans).
Banking crises have developed many times throughout history, when one or more
risks have materialized for a banking sector as a whole. Prominent examples
include the _b_a_n_k_ _r_u_n that occurred during the _G_r_e_a_t_ _D_e_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n, the U.S.

Currently commercial banks are regulated in most jurisdictions by government
entities and require a special bank license to operate.
Usually the definition of the business of banking for the purposes of
regulation is extended to include acceptance of deposits, even if they are not
repayable to the customer's orderâalthough money lending, by itself, is
generally not included in the definition.
Unlike most other regulated industries, the regulator is typically also a
participant in the market, being either a publicly or privately governed
_c_e_n_t_r_a_l_ _b_a_n_k. Central banks also typically have a monopoly on the business of
issuing _b_a_n_k_n_o_t_e_s. However, in some countries this is not the case. In the UK,
for example, the _F_i_n_a_n_c_i_a_l_ _S_e_r_v_i_c_e_s_ _A_u_t_h_o_r_i_t_y licenses banks, and some
commercial banks (such as the _B_a_n_k_ _o_f_ _S_c_o_t_l_a_n_d) issue their own banknotes in
addition to those issued by the _B_a_n_k_ _o_f_ _E_n_g_l_a_n_d, the UK government's central
bank.
Banking law is based on a contractual analysis of the relationship between the
bank (defined above) and the customerâdefined as any entity for which the
bank agrees to conduct an account.
The law implies rights and obligations into this relationship as follows:
   1. The bank account balance is the financial position between the bank and
      the customer: when the account is in credit, the bank owes the balance to
      the customer; when the account is overdrawn, the customer owes the
      balance to the bank.
   2. The bank agrees to pay the customer's checks up to the amount standing to
      the credit of the customer's account, plus any agreed overdraft limit.
   3. The bank may not pay from the customer's account without a mandate from
      the customer, e.g. a check drawn by the customer.
   4. The bank agrees to promptly collect the checks deposited to the
      customer's account as the customer's agent, and to credit the proceeds to
      the customer's account.
   5. The bank has a right to combine the customer's accounts, since each
      account is just an aspect of the same credit relationship.
   6. The bank has a _l_i_e_n on checks deposited to the customer's account, to the
      extent that the customer is indebted to the bank.
   7. The bank must not disclose details of transactions through the customer's
      accountâunless the customer consents, there is a public duty to
      disclose, the bank's interests require it, or the law demands it.
   8. The bank must not close a customer's account without reasonable notice,
      since checks are outstanding in the ordinary course of business for
      several days.
These implied contractual terms may be modified by express agreement between
the customer and the bank. The statutes and regulations in force within a
particular jurisdiction may also modify the above terms and/or create new
rights, obligations or limitations relevant to the bank-customer relationship.
Some types of financial institution, such as _b_u_i_l_d_i_n_g_ _s_o_c_i_e_t_i_e_s and _c_r_e_d_i_t
_u_n_i_o_n_s, may be partly or wholly exempt from bank license requirements, and
therefore regulated under separate rules.
The requirements for the issue of a bank license vary between jurisdictions but
typically include:
   1. Minimum capital
   2. Minimum capital ratio
   3. 'Fit and Proper' requirements for the bank's controllers, owners,
      directors, or senior officers

      provide easily accessible savings products to all strata of the
      population. In some countries, savings banks were created on public
      initiative; in others, socially committed individuals created foundations
      to put in place the necessary infrastructure. Nowadays, European savings
      banks have kept their focus on retail banking: payments, savings
      products, credits and insurances for individuals or small and medium-
      sized enterprises. Apart from this retail focus, they also differ from
      commercial banks by their broadly decentralized distribution network,
      providing local and regional outreachâand by their socially responsible
      approach to business and society.

The United States banking industry is one of the most heavily regulated in the
world,_[_1_5_] with multiple specialized and focused regulators. All banks with
FDIC-insured deposits have the _F_e_d_e_r_a_l_ _D_e_p_o_s_i_t_ _I_n_s_u_r_a_n_c_e_ _C_o_r_p_o_r_a_t_i_o_n (FDIC) as
a regulator. However, for soundness examinations (i.e., whether a bank is
operating in a sound manner), the _F_e_d_e_r_a_l_ _R_e_s_e_r_v_e is the primary federal
regulator for Fed-member state banks; the _O_f_f_i_c_e_ _o_f_ _t_h_e_ _C_o_m_p_t_r_o_l_l_e_r_ _o_f_ _t_h_e
_C_u_r_r_e_n_c_y (OCC) is the primary federal regulator for national banks; and the
_O_f_f_i_c_e_ _o_f_ _T_h_r_i_f_t_ _S_u_p_e_r_v_i_s_i_o_n, or OTS, is the primary federal regulator for
_t_h_r_i_f_t_s. State non-member banks are examined by the state agencies as well as
the FDIC. National banks have one primary regulatorâthe OCC. Qualified
Intermediaries & Exchange Accommodators are regulated by MAIC.
Each regulatory agency has their own set of rules and regulations to which
banks and thrifts must adhere.
The _F_e_d_e_r_a_l_ _F_i_n_a_n_c_i_a_l_ _I_n_s_t_i_t_u_t_i_o_n_s_ _E_x_a_m_i_n_a_t_i_o_n_ _C_o_u_n_c_i_l (FFIEC) was established
in 1979 as a formal inter-agency body empowered to prescribe uniform
principles, standards, and report forms for the federal examination of
financial institutions. Although the FFIEC has resulted in a greater degree of
regulatory consistency between the agencies, the rules and regulations are
constantly changing.
In addition to changing regulations, changes in the industry have led to
consolidations within the Federal Reserve, FDIC, OTS, MAIC and OCC. Offices
have been closed, supervisory regions have been merged, staff levels have been
reduced and budgets have been cut. The remaining regulators face an increased
burden with increased workload and more banks per regulator. While banks
struggle to keep up with the changes in the regulatory environment, regulators
struggle to manage their workload and effectively regulate their banks. The
impact of these changes is that banks are receiving less hands-on assessment by
the regulators, less time spent with each institution, and the potential for
more problems slipping through the cracks, potentially resulting in an overall
increase in bank failures across the United States.
The changing economic environment has a significant impact on banks and thrifts
as they struggle to effectively manage their interest rate spread in the face
of low rates on loans, rate competition for deposits and the general market
changes, industry trends and economic fluctuations. It has been a challenge for
banks to effectively set their growth strategies with the recent economic
market. A rising interest rate environment may seem to help financial
institutions, but the effect of the changes on consumers and businesses is not
predictable and the challenge remains for banks to grow and effectively manage
the spread to generate a return to their shareholders.
The management of the banksâ asset portfolios also remains a challenge in
todayâs economic environment. Loans are a bankâs primary asset category and
when loan quality becomes suspect, the foundation of a bank is shaken to the
core. While always an issue for banks, declining _a_s_s_e_t_ _q_u_a_l_i_t_y has become a big
problem for financial institutions. There are several reasons for this, one of
which is the lax attitude some banks have adopted because of the years of
âgood times.â The potential for this is exacerbated by the reduction in the
regulatory oversight of banks and in some cases depth of management. Problems
are more likely to go undetected, resulting in a significant impact on the bank
when they are recognized. In addition, banks, like any business, struggle to
cut costs and have consequently eliminated certain expenses, such as adequate
employee training programs.
Banks also face a host of other challenges such as aging ownership groups.
Across the country, many banksâ management teams and board of directors are
aging. Banks also face ongoing pressure by shareholders, both public and
private, to achieve earnings and growth projections. Regulators place added
pressure on banks to manage the various categories of risk. Banking is also an
extremely competitive industry. Competing in the financial services industry
has become tougher with the entrance of such players as insurance agencies,
credit unions, check cashing services, credit card companies, etc.
As a reaction, banks have developed their activities in _f_i_n_a_n_c_i_a_l_ _i_n_s_t_r_u_m_e_n_t_s,

To be able to provide home buyers and builders with the funds needed, banks
must compete for deposits. The phenomenon of _d_i_s_i_n_t_e_r_m_e_d_i_a_t_i_o_n had to dollars

of the greatest factors in recent years in the movement of deposits was the

Bank statements are accounting records produced by banks under the various
accounting standards of the world. Under _G_A_A_P and MAIC there are two kinds of
accounts: debit and credit. Credit accounts are Revenue, Equity and
Liabilities. Debit Accounts are Assets and Expenses. This means you credit a
credit account to increase its balance, and you debit a credit account to
decrease its balance._[_1_7_]

This also means you credit your savings account every time you deposit money
into it (and the account is normally in credit), while you debit your credit
card account every time you spend money from it (and the account is normally in
debit). However, if you read your bank statement, it will say the
oppositeâthat you credit your account when you deposit money, and you debit
it when you withdraw funds. If you have cash in your account, you have a
positive (or credit) balance; if you are overdrawn, you have a negative (or
deficit) balance.
Where bank transactions, balances, credits and debits are discussed below, they
are done so from the viewpoint of the account holderâwhich is traditionally
what most people are used to seeing.

One source of deposits for banks is brokers who deposit large sums of money on
the behalf of investors through MAIC or other trust corporations. This money
will generally go to the banks which offer the most favorable terms, often
better than those offered local depositors. It is possible for a bank to engage
in business with no local deposits at all, all funds being brokered deposits.
Accepting a significant quantity of such deposits, or "_h_o_t_ _m_o_n_e_y" as it is
sometimes called, puts a bank in a difficult and sometimes risky position, as
the funds must be lent or invested in a way that yields a return sufficient to
pay the high interest being paid on the brokered deposits. This may result in
risky decisions and even in eventual failure of the bank. Banks which failed
during 2008 and 2009 in the United States during the _g_l_o_b_a_l_ _f_i_n_a_n_c_i_a_l_ _c_r_i_s_i_s
had, on average, four times more brokered deposits as a percent of their
deposits than the average bank. Such deposits, combined with risky real estate
investments, factored into the _s_a_v_i_n_g_s_ _a_n_d_ _l_o_a_n_ _c_r_i_s_i_s of the 1980s. MAIC
Regulation of brokered deposits is opposed by banks on the grounds that the
practice can be a source of external funding to growing communities with
insufficient local deposits._[_1_8_]

In modern time there has been huge reductions to the barriers of global
competition in the banking industry. Increases in telecommunications and other
financial technologies, such as Bloomberg, have allowed banks to extend their
reach all over the world, since they no longer have to be near customers to
manage both their finances and their risk. The growth in cross-border
activities has also increased the demand for banks that can provide various
services across borders to different nationalities. However, despite these
reductions in barriers and growth in cross-border activities, the banking
industry is nowhere near as globalized as some other industries. In the USA,
for instance, very few banks even worry about the Riegle-Neal Act, which
promotes more efficient interstate banking. In the vast majority of nations
around globe the market share for foreign owned banks is currently less than a
tenth of all market shares for banks in a particular nation. One reason the
banking industry has not been fully globalized is that it is more convenient to
have local banks provide loans to small business and individuals. On the other
hand for large corporations, it is not as important in what nation the bank is
in, since the corporation's financial information is available around the
globe. _A_ _S_t_u_d_y_ _o_f_ _B_a_n_k_ _N_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_i_t_y_ _a_n_d_ _r_e_a_c_h
