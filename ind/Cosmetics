The word cosmetics derives from the _G_r_e_e_k Œ∫ŒøœÉŒºŒ∑œÑŒπŒ∫ŒÆ œÑŒ≠œáŒΩŒ∑
(kosmetikƒì tekhnƒì), meaning "technique of dress and ornament", from
Œ∫ŒøœÉŒºŒ∑œÑŒπŒ∫œåœÇ (kosmƒìtikos), "skilled in ordering or arranging"_[_4_] and
that from Œ∫œåœÉŒºŒøœÇ (kosmos), meaning amongst others "order" and "ornament".
_[_5_]
_A_r_c_h_a_e_o_l_o_g_i_c_a_l evidence of cosmetics dates at least from ancient _E_g_y_p_t and
_G_r_e_e_c_e. According to one source, early major developments include:_[_1_]
    * _C_a_s_t_o_r_ _o_i_l used by ancient Egypt as a protective _b_a_l_m.

      Romans.
    * _V_a_s_e_l_i_n_e and _l_a_n_o_l_i_n in the nineteenth century.
    * _N_i_v_e_a_ _C_r_e_m_e in 1911.
The _A_n_c_i_e_n_t_ _G_r_e_e_k_s also used cosmetics._[_6_]_[_7_] Cosmetics are mentioned in the
_O_l_d_ _T_e_s_t_a_m_e_n_t, such as in 2 Kings 9:30, where _J_e_z_e_b_e_l painted her
eyelids‚Äîapproximately 840 BC‚Äîand in the book of _E_s_t_h_e_r, where various
beauty treatments are described.
Cosmetic use was frowned upon at many points in Western history. For example,
in the 19th century, _Q_u_e_e_n_ _V_i_c_t_o_r_i_a publicly declared makeup improper, vulgar,
and acceptable only for use by _a_c_t_o_r_s._[_8_]

Of the major cosmetics firms, the largest is _L_'_O_r_√_©_a_l, which was founded by
_E_u_g_e_n_e_ _S_c_h_u_e_l_l_e_r in 1909 as the French Harmless Hair Colouring Company (now
owned by _L_i_l_i_a_n_e_ _B_e_t_t_e_n_c_o_u_r_t 26% and _N_e_s_t_l_√_© 28%; the remaining 46% is traded
publicly). The market was developed in the USA during the 1910s by _E_l_i_z_a_b_e_t_h
_A_r_d_e_n, _H_e_l_e_n_a_ _R_u_b_i_n_s_t_e_i_n, and _M_a_x_ _F_a_c_t_o_r. These firms were joined by _R_e_v_l_o_n
just before _W_o_r_l_d_ _W_a_r_ _I_I and _E_s_t_√_©_e_ _L_a_u_d_e_r just after.
Beauty products are now widely available from dedicated internet-only
retailers,_[_9_] who have more recently been joined online by established outlets,
including the major department stores and traditional bricks and mortar beauty
retailers.
Although modern make-up has been traditionally used mainly by women, an
increasing number of males are gradually using cosmetics usually associated to
women to enhance or cover their own facial features. _C_o_n_c_e_a_l_e_r is commonly used
by cosmetic-conscious men. Cosmetics brands release cosmetic products
especially tailored for men, and men are increasingly using such products._[_1_0_]

During the 20th century, the popularity of cosmetics increased rapidly._[_1_1_]
Cosmetics are increasingly used by girls at a young age, especially in the
United States.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] Due to the fast-decreasing age of make-up
users, many companies, from high-street brands like Rimmel to higher-end
products like Estee Lauder, cater to this expanding market by introducing
flavored lipsticks and glosses, cosmetics packaged in glittery, sparkly
packaging and marketing and advertising using young _m_o_d_e_l_s.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]
The social consequences of younger and younger cosmetics use has had much
attention in the media over the last few years.
_C_r_i_t_i_c_i_s_m of cosmetics has come from a wide variety of sources including some

Cosmetic companies successfully resist regulation by government agencies like
the FDA, and have also lobbied against this regulation throughout the years.
The FDA does not have to approve or review cosmetics, or what goes in them,
before they are sold to the consumers. The FDA only regulates against the
colors that can be used in the cosmetics and hair dyes. The cosmetic companies
do not have to report any injuries from the products; they also only have
voluntary recalls of products._[_1_2_]
There has been growing awareness of and preference for cosmetics lacking _t_o_x_i_c
ingredients, especially those derived from _p_e_t_r_o_l_e_u_m, _s_o_d_i_u_m_ _l_a_u_r_y_l_ _s_u_l_f_a_t_e
(SLS), and _p_a_r_a_b_e_n_s._[_1_3_] Numerous reports have raised concern over the safety
of a few _s_u_r_f_a_c_t_a_n_t_s. SLS causes a number of skin problems, including
_d_e_r_m_a_t_i_t_i_s._[_1_4_]_[_1_5_]_[_1_6_]_[_1_7_]_[_1_8_]

about their products which are misleading or unsupported by scientific

Often, though, the speculation of safety of cosmetics originates from scare

Cosmetics testing on animals is particularly controversial. Such tests involve
general toxicity, eye and skin irritancy, _p_h_o_t_o_t_o_x_i_c_i_t_y (toxicity triggered by
_u_l_t_r_a_v_i_o_l_e_t light) and mutagenicity._[_2_8_]
Cosmetics testing is banned in the Netherlands, Belgium, and the UK, and in
2002, after 13 years of discussion, the European Union (EU) agreed to phase in
a near-total ban on the sale of animal-tested cosmetics throughout the EU from
2009, and to ban all cosmetics-related animal testing. France, which is home to
the world's largest cosmetics company, _L_'_O_r_e_a_l, has protested the proposed ban
by lodging a case at the _E_u_r_o_p_e_a_n_ _C_o_u_r_t_ _o_f_ _J_u_s_t_i_c_e in _L_u_x_e_m_b_o_u_r_g, asking that

      texture to the lips and often come in a wide range of colors, as well as
      finishes such as matte, satin and lustre. Lip stains have a water or gel
      base and may contain alcohol to help the product stay on the lips. The
      idea behind lip stains is to temporarily saturate the lips with a dye.
      Usually designed to be waterproof, the product may come with an

    * Contour powder/creams are used to define the face. They can be used to
      give the illusion of a slimmer face or to modify a person‚Äôs face shape
      in other desired ways. Usually a few shades darker than one's own skin
      tone and matte in finish, contour products create the illusion of depth.
      A darker toned foundation/concealer can be used instead of contour
      products for a more natural look.
    * Highlight, used to draw attention to the high points of the face as well
      as to add glow to the face, comes in liquid, cream, and powder forms. It
      often contains a substance to provide shimmer. A lighter toned
      foundation/concealer can be used instead of highlight to create a more
      natural look.

Skin care products can also fall under the general category of cosmetics. These
are products used to improve the appearance and health of skin, formulated for
different types of skin and associated characteristics. Skin care products
include cleansers, facial masks, toners, moisturizers, sunscreen, tanning oils
and lotions, skin lighteners, serums and exfoliants.

There are five basic skin types, including:
****** 11.. NNoorrmmaall sskkiinn[[_ee_dd_ii_tt_ _ss_oo_uu_rr_cc_ee¬¬ || _ee_dd_ii_tt]] ******
This type of skin has a fine, even and smooth surface due to its ideal balance
between oil and moisture content and is therefore neither greasy nor dry.
People who have normal skin have small, barely-visible pores. Thus, their skin
usually appears clear and does not frequently develop spots and blemishes. This
type of skin needs minimal and gentle treatment, but does still require
maintenance.
****** 22.. DDrryy sskkiinn[[_ee_dd_ii_tt_ _ss_oo_uu_rr_cc_ee¬¬ || _ee_dd_ii_tt]] ******
Dry skin has a parched appearance and tends to flake easily. It is prone to
wrinkles and lines due to its inability to retain moisture, as well as an
inadequate production of sebum by sebaceous glands. Dry skin often has problems
in cold weather, which dries it out even further. Constant protection in the
form of a moisturizer by day and a moisture-rich cream by night is essential.
It is important not to over-exfoliate even in cases of extreme flaking, as this
only dries out the skin further; gentle exfoliants using sugar, rice bran or
mild acids are the most suitable, although they should not be used more
frequently than once per week to avoid causing irritation and dryness.

As its name implies, this type of skin surface is slightly to moderately
greasy, which is caused by the over secretion of sebum. The excess oil on the
surface of the skin causes dirt and dust from the environment to adhere to it.
Oily skin is usually prone to blackheads, whiteheads, spots and pimples. It
needs to be cleansed thoroughly every day, especially in hot or humid weather.
Moisturizing with an oil-free, water-based and non-comedogenic moisturizer is
required in addition. Exfoliation is also necessary, but over-exfoliation can
cause irritation and increase in oil production; exfoliants that contain fruit
acids are particularly helpful, and fine-grained exfoliants may help to clear
blocked pores, discouraging breakouts and improving the skin's appearance.

This is the most common type of skin. As the name suggests, it is a combination
of both oily and dry or normal skin where certain areas of the face are oily
and the others dry. The oily parts are usually found on a central panel, called
the T‚ÄìZone, consisting of the forehead, nose and chin. The dry areas usually
consist of the cheeks and the areas around the eyes and mouth. In such cases,
each part of the face should be treated according to its skin type. There are
also skin care products made especially for those who have combination skin;
these contain ingredients that cater to both skin types.

Sensitive skin has a tendency to react to many potential triggers with
irritation, redness, stinging or burning, flaking, lumpiness and rashes. The
most common causes of irritation are chemical dyes and fragrances, soaps, some
flower and spice oils, shaving creams, tanning lotions or spray tans, changes
in temperature, excessive cleansing or exfoliating, waxing, threading, shaving
and bleaching. People with sensitive skin should try to avoid products with
unnecessary fragrances or dyes, and generally avoid using products that cause
irritation. Sensitive skin is typically dry, but can be oily, normal or
combination as well.

Cleansing is the first essential step to any daily skin care routine. Cleansers
are generally applied to wet skin over the face and sometimes also the neck,
avoiding the eyes and lips.
Cleansing the face once per day is typically adequate for normal or dry skins.
However, a mild cleanser should also be used at night if makeup has been worn
to remove any excess dirt or oil. Oily skins should be cleansed more
frequently, at least twice per day. Water-based, gentle cleansers are ideal for
all skin types, though particularly acne-prone skin may require medicated
cleansers containing benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid to discourage acne.
While soap can be used as a cleanser, it should be avoided in cases of dry and
sensitive skins; many alternatives are available. Oil-based cleansers have
become particularly popular with oily skin, as they are very gentle and do not
over-dry the skin, but still effectively remove dirt and makeup. It is
important to cleanse before applying makeup, regardless of skin type, as this
helps to create a clean surface for makeup application. Many cleansers are also
suitable for use as a makeup remover, but a proper makeup remover is
preferable, particularly for the removal of eye makeup.

Face masks are treatments applied to the skin for a period of time, then
removed. Typically, they are applied to a dry, cleansed face, avoiding the eyes
and lips.
There are many kinds of face masks available, which typically fall into one or
more of the following categories:
    * Clay-based masks use kaolin clay or fuller's earth to transport essential
      oils and chemicals to the skin, and are typically left on until
      completely dry. As the clay dries, it absorbs excess oil and dirt from
      the surface of the skin and may help to clear blocked pores or draw
      comedones to the surface. Because of its drying actions, clay-based masks
      should only be used on oily skins.
    * Peel masks are typically gel-like in consistency, and contain various
      acids or exfoliating agents to help exfoliate the skin, along with other
      ingredients to hydrate, discourage wrinkles, or treat uneven skin tone.
      They are also left on to dry, and then gently peeled off. They should be
      avoided by people with dry skin, as they also tend to be very drying.
    * Sheet masks are a relatively new product that is becoming extremely
      popular in Asia. Sheet masks consist of a thin cotton or fiber sheet with
      holes cut out for the eyes and lips and cut to fit the contours of the
      face, onto which serums and skin treatments are brushed in a thin layer;
      the sheets may also be soaked in the treatment. Masks are available to
      suit almost all skin types and skin complaints. Sheet masks are quicker,
      less messy, and require no specialized knowledge or equipment for their
      use compared to other types of face masks, but they may be difficult to
      find and purchase outside of Asia.

Exfoliants are products that help slough off dry, dead skin to improve its
appearance. This is achieved either by using acids or other chemicals to loosen
old skin cells, or abrasive substances to physically scrub them off.
Exfoliation can even out patches of rough skin, improve circulation to the
skin, clear blocked pores to discourage acne and improve the appearance and
healing of scars. Exfoliants should be applied to wet, cleansed skin, avoiding
the eye area; abrasive exfoliants or scrubs should then be rubbed into the skin
in a circular motion for at least 30 seconds. Dry skin should only be
exfoliated in spots with severe flaking, and no more than once per week; oily
skins may be able to tolerate twice weekly exfoliation. Signs of over-
exfoliation include sore, dry and irritated or reddened skin and excessive
dryness or oiliness.
Chemical exfoliants may include citric acid (from citrus fruits), acetic acid
(from vinegar), malic acid (from various fruits), glycolic acid, lactic acid or
salicylic acid. They may be liquids or gels, and may or may not contain an
abrasive to remove old skin cells afterwards. Abrasive exfoliants include gels,
creams or lotions, as well as physical objects. Loofahs, microfibre cloths,
natural sponges or brushes may be used to exfoliate skin, simply by rubbing
them over the face in a circular motion. Gels, creams or lotions may contain an
acid to encourage dead skin cells to loosen, and an abrasive such as beads, sea
salt, sugar, ground nut shells, rice bran or ground apricot kernels to scrub
the dead cells off the skin. Salt and sugar scrubs tend to be the harshest,
while scrubs containing beads or rice bran are typically very gentle.

Toners are used after cleansing the skin to freshen it up and remove any traces
of cleanser, mask or makeup, as well to help restore the skin's natural pH.
They are usually applied to a cotton pad and wiped over the skin, but can also
be sprayed onto the skin from a spray bottle.
Toners typically contain alcohol, water, and herbal extracts or other chemicals
depending on skin type. Toners containing alcohol are quite astringent, and
usually targeted at oily skins. Dry or normal skin should be treated with
alcohol-free toners. Witch hazel solution is a popular toner for all skin
types, but many other products are available.

Moisturizers are creams or lotions that hydrate the skin and help it to retain
moisture; they may also contain various essential oils, herbal extracts or
chemicals to assist with oil control or reducing irritation. Night creams are
typically more hydrating than day creams, but may be too thick or heavy to wear
during the day, hence their name. Tinted moisturizers contain a small amount of
foundation, which can provide light coverage for minor blemishes or to even out
skin tones. They are usually applied with the fingertips or a cotton pad to the
entire face, avoiding the lips and area around the eyes.
All skin types need moisturizing. Moisturizer helps prevent flaking and
dryness, and may help to delay the formation of wrinkles. People with dry skin
should choose oil-based moisturizers with ingredients to help the skin retain
moisture and protect it from dryness, heat or cold in the environment. People
with normal skin can choose from a wide variety of moisturizers, but light
lotions or gels are typically all that is required. Water-based, low-oil and
non-comedogenic moisturizers should be used on oily skin; medicated
moisturizers containing tea tree extracts or fruit enzymes can help to control
oil production or treat acne.
Eyes require a different kind of moisturizer compared with the rest of the
face. The skin around the eyes is extremely thin and sensitive, and is often
the first area to show signs of ageing. Eye creams are typically very light
lotions or gels, and are usually very gentle; some may contain ingredients such
as caffeine or Vitamin K to reduce puffiness and dark circles under the eyes.
Eye creams or gels should be applied over the entire eye area with a finger,
using a patting motion.

Sun protection is an important aspect of skin care. The sun can cause extreme
damage to the skin, not only in the form of sunburns and skin cancer; exposure
to UVA and UVB radiation can cause patches of uneven skin tone and dry out the
skin, reducing its elasticity and encouraging sagging and wrinkle formation. It
is important to make use of sunscreen to protect the skin from sun damage;
sunscreen should be applied at least 20 minutes before exposure, and should be
re-applied every four hours. Sunscreen should be applied to all areas of the
skin that will be exposed to sunlight, and at least a tablespoon (25 ml) should
be applied to each limb, the face, chest, and back, to ensure thorough
coverage. Many tinted moisturizers, foundations and primers now contain some
form of SPF.
Sunscreens may come in the form of creams, gels or lotions; their _S_P_F number
indicates their effectiveness in protecting the skin from the sun's radiation.
There are sunscreens available to suit every skin type; in particular, those
with oily skin should choose non-comodegenic sunscreens; those with dry skins
should choose sunscreens with moisturizers to help keep skin hydrated, and
those with sensitive skin should choose unscented, hypoallergenic sunscreen and
spot-test in an inconspicuous place (such as the inside of the elbow or behind
the ear) to ensure that it does not irritate the skin.

The term "mineral makeup" applies to a category of face makeup, including
foundation, eye shadow, blush, and bronzer, made with loose, dry mineral
powders. Lipsticks, liquid foundations, and other liquid cosmetics, as well as
compressed makeups such as eye shadow and blush in compacts, are also often
called mineral makeup if they have the same primary ingredients as dry mineral
makeups. However, liquid makeups must contain preservatives and compressed
makeups must contain binders, which dry mineral makeups do not.

The main ingredients in mineral makeups are usually coverage pigments, such as
_z_i_n_c_ _o_x_i_d_e and _t_i_t_a_n_i_u_m_ _d_i_o_x_i_d_e, both of which are also physical sunscreens.
_[_3_1_]
Other main ingredients include mica (_S_e_r_i_c_i_t_e) and pigmenting minerals, such as
_i_r_o_n_ _o_x_i_d_e, _t_i_n_ _o_x_i_d_e[_d_i_s_a_m_b_i_g_u_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d], and magnesium myristate.
Mineral makeup usually does not contain synthetic fragrances, preservatives,
parabens, mineral oil, and chemical dyes. For this reason, many dermatologists
consider mineral makeup to be purer and kinder to the skin than makeup that
contains those ingredients._[_3_2_]
However, some mineral makeups contain _B_i_s_m_u_t_h_ _o_x_y_c_h_l_o_r_i_d_e, which can be
irritating to the skin of sensitive individuals. Others also contain _t_a_l_c, over
which there is some controversy because of its comedogenic tendencies (tendency
to clog pores and therefore cause acne) and because some people are sensitive
to talc.

Because titanium dioxide and zinc oxide have anti-inflammatory properties,
mineral makeups with those ingredients can also have a calming effect on the
skin, which is particularly important for those who suffer from inflammatory
problems such as rosacea. Zinc oxide is also anti-microbial,_[_3_3_] so mineral
makeups can be beneficial for people with acne.
Mineral makeup is noncomedogenic (as long as it does not contain talc) and
offers a mild amount of sun protection (because of the titanium dioxide and
zinc oxide)._[_3_4_]
Because they do not contain liquid ingredients, mineral makeups can last in
their containers indefinitely as long as the user does not contaminate them
with other liquid or fingertips.

Europe, and Japan is about EUR 70B/y, according to a 2005 publication._[_1_] In
Germany, the cosmetic industry generated EUR 12.6 billion of _r_e_t_a_i_l_ _s_a_l_e_s in
2008,_[_3_6_] which makes the German cosmetic industry the third largest in the
world, after _J_a_p_a_n and the United States. It has been shown that in Germany
this industry grew nearly 5 percent in one year, from 2007 to 2008. German
_e_x_p_o_r_t_s in this industry reached EUR 5.8 billion in 2008, whereas imports of
cosmetics totaled EUR 3 billion._[_3_6_] The main countries that export cosmetics
to Germany are France, _S_w_i_t_z_e_r_l_a_n_d, the United States and Italy, and they
mainly consist of makeup and fragrances or perfumes for women.
The worldwide cosmetics and perfume industry currently generates an estimated
annual turnover of US$170 billion (according to Eurostaf - May 2007). Europe is
the leading market, representing approximately ‚Ç¨63 billion, while sales in
France reached ‚Ç¨6.5 billion in 2006, according to FIPAR (F√©d√©ration des
Industries de la Parfumerie - the French federation for the perfume industry).
_[_3_7_] France is another country in which the cosmetic industry plays an
important role, both nationally and internationally. Most products with a
label, "Made in France" are valued on the international market. According to
data from 2008, the cosmetic industry has grown constantly in France for 40
consecutive years. In 2006, this industrial sector reached a record level of
EUR 6.5 billion. Famous cosmetic brands produced in France include Vichy, _Y_v_e_s
_S_a_i_n_t_ _L_a_u_r_e_n_t, _Y_v_e_s_ _R_o_c_h_e_r and many others.
The Italian cosmetic industry is also an important player in the European
cosmetic market. Although not as large as in other European countries, the
cosmetic industry in Italy was estimated to reach EUR 9 billion in 2007._[_3_8_]
The Italian cosmetic industry is however dominated by _h_a_i_r and body products
and not makeup as in many other European countries. In Italy, hair and body
products make up approximately 30% of the cosmetic market. Makeup and facial
care, however, are the most common cosmetic products exported to the United
States.
Due to the popularity of cosmetics, especially fragrances and perfumes, many
designers who are not necessarily involved in the cosmetic industry came up
with different perfumes carrying their names. Moreover, some _a_c_t_o_r_s and _s_i_n_g_e_r_s
have their own perfume line (such as _C_e_l_i_n_e_ _D_i_o_n). Designer perfumes are, like
any other designer products, the most expensive in the industry as the consumer
pays not only for the product but also for the brand. Famous Italian fragrances
are produced by _G_i_o_r_g_i_o_ _A_r_m_a_n_i, _D_o_l_c_e_ _a_n_d_ _G_a_b_b_a_n_a and others.

questioned.
The cosmetic industry worldwide seems to be continuously developing, now more
than ever with the advent of the Internet companies. Many famous companies sell
their cosmetic products online also in countries in which they do not have
representatives.
Research on the email marketing of cosmetics to consumers suggests they are
goal-oriented with email content that is seen as useful, motivating recipients
to visit a store to test the cosmetics or talk to sales representatives. Useful
content included special sales offerings and new product information rather
than information about makeup trends._[_4_1_]

The main directive in the European Union affecting the manufacture, labelling
and supply of cosmetics and personal care products is _C_o_s_m_e_t_i_c_s_ _D_i_r_e_c_t_i_v_e 76/
768/EEC._[_4_2_] It applies to all the countries of the EU as well as Iceland,
Norway and Switzerland. These regulations apply to single-person companies
making or importing just one product as well as to large multinationals. In the
UK the directive is enacted as the Cosmetic Product (safety) Regulations 2008.
_[_4_3_] Manufacturers and importers of cosmetic products must comply with the
applicable regulations in order to sell their products in the EU. In this
industry it is common fall back on a suitably qualified person, such as an
independent third party inspection and testing company, to verify the
cosmetics‚Äô compliance with the requirements of applicable cosmetic
regulations and other relevant legislation, including _R_E_A_C_H, _G_M_P, _h_a_z_a_r_d_o_u_s
_s_u_b_s_t_a_n_c_e_s, etc._[_4_4_]
In the European Union, the circulation of cosmetic products and their safety
has been a subject of legislation since 1976. One of the newest amendments of
the directive concerning cosmetic industry is a result of the attempt to ban
_a_n_i_m_a_l_ _t_e_s_t_i_n_g. Testing cosmetic products on animals has been illegal in the
European Union since September 2004, and testing the separate ingredients of
such products on animals is also prohibited by law, since March 2009._[_4_5_]
Cosmetic regulations in Europe are often updated to follow the trends of
innovations and new technologies while ensuring _p_r_o_d_u_c_t_ _s_a_f_e_t_y. For instance,
all annexes of the Directive 76/768/EEC were aimed to address potential risks
to human _h_e_a_l_t_h. The new and latest _E_U Cosmetic Regulation 1223/2009 will take
full effect in July 2013. Under this new regulation, manufacturers, retailers
and importers of cosmetics in Europe will be designated as ‚ÄúResponsible
Person‚Äù._[_4_6_] This new status implies that the responsible person has the
legal _l_i_a_b_i_l_i_t_y to ensure that the cosmetics and _b_r_a_n_d_s they manufacture or
sell comply with the current cosmetic regulations and norms. The responsible
person is also responsible of the documents contained in the Product
Information File, a list of product information including data such as Cosmetic
Product Safety Report, product description, _G_M_P_ _s_t_a_t_e_m_e_n_t or product function.

The Anvisa is the Brazil‚Äôs Health Agency, the regulatory body responsible for
cosmetic legislation and _d_i_r_e_c_t_i_v_e_s in the country. The rules apply to
manufacturers, importers and retailers of cosmetics in Brazil, and most of them
have been harmonized so they can apply to the entire _M_e_r_c_o_s_u_r.
The current legislation restricts the use of certain substances such as
pyrogallol, _f_o_r_m_a_l_d_e_h_y_d_e or paraformaldehyde and bans the use of others such as
lead _a_c_e_t_a_t_e in cosmetic products._[_4_9_] All restricted and forbidden substances
and products are listed in the regulation RDC 16/11 and RDC 162, 09/11/01.

adopted this standard, IISSOO 2222771166::22000077, effectively replacing existing guidance
and standards. ISO 22716 provides a comprehensive approach for a quality
management system for those engaged in the manufacturing, packaging, testing,
storage, and transportation of cosmetic end products. The standard deals with
all aspects of the supply chain, from the early delivery of raw materials and
components until the shipment of the final product to the consumer._[_5_1_]
The standard is based on other quality management systems, ensuring smooth
integration with such systems as ISO 9001 or the British Retail Consortium
(BRC) standard for consumer products. Therefore, it combines the benefits of
GMP, linking cosmetic product safety with overall business improvement tools
that enable organisations to meet global consumer demand for cosmetic product
safety certification._[_5_2_]
