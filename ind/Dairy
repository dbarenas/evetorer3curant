A dairy farm near _O_x_f_o_r_d_,_ _N_e_w_ _Y_o_r_k in the United States.
A ddaaiirryy is a business enterprise established for the harvesting of animal _m_i_l_k
â€“ mostly from _c_o_w_s or _g_o_a_t_s, but also from _b_u_f_f_a_l_o, _s_h_e_e_p, _h_o_r_s_e_s or _c_a_m_e_l_s
â€“ for human consumption. A dairy is typically located on a dedicated dairy
farm or section of a multi-purpose farm that is concerned with the harvesting
of milk.
Terminology differs between countries. For example, in the _U_n_i_t_e_d_ _S_t_a_t_e_s, a
farm building where milk is harvested is often called a "milking parlor". In
_N_e_w_ _Z_e_a_l_a_n_d such a building is historically known as a "milking shed" or
"milking parlour" (note the different spelling). Sometimes milking sheds are
referred to by their type, such as "herring bone shed" or "pit parlour". In
some countries, especially those with small numbers of animals being milked, as
well as harvesting the milk from an animal, the dairy may also process the milk
into _b_u_t_t_e_r, _c_h_e_e_s_e and _y_o_g_u_r_t, for example. This is a traditional method of
producing specialist milk products, especially in Europe. In the United States
a dairy can also be a place that processes, distributes and sells _d_a_i_r_y
_p_r_o_d_u_c_t_s, or a room, building or establishment where milk is stored and
processed into milk products, such as _b_u_t_t_e_r or _c_h_e_e_s_e. In _N_e_w_ _Z_e_a_l_a_n_d_ _E_n_g_l_i_s_h
the singular use of the word dairy almost exclusively refers to the corner
_c_o_n_v_e_n_i_e_n_c_e_ _s_t_o_r_e, or _s_u_p_e_r_e_t_t_e. This usage is historical as such stores were a
common place for the public to buy milk products.
As an attributive, the word dairy refers to milk-based products, veil,
derivatives and processes, and the animals and workers involved in their
production: for example _d_a_i_r_y_ _c_a_t_t_l_e, _d_a_i_r_y_ _g_o_a_t. A _d_a_i_r_y_ _f_a_r_m produces milk
and a dairy _f_a_c_t_o_r_y processes it into a variety of dairy products. These
establishments constitute the dairy industry, a component of the _f_o_o_d_ _i_n_d_u_s_t_r_y.

Milk producing animals have been domesticated for thousands of years.
Initially, they were part of the subsistence farming that nomads engaged in. As
the community moved about the country, their animals accompanied them.
Protecting and feeding the animals were a big part of the symbiotic
relationship between the animals and the _h_e_r_d_e_r_s.
In the more recent past, people in _a_g_r_i_c_u_l_t_u_r_a_l_ _s_o_c_i_e_t_i_e_s owned dairy animals
that they milked for domestic and local (village) consumption, a typical
example of a _c_o_t_t_a_g_e_ _i_n_d_u_s_t_r_y. The animals might serve multiple purposes (for
example, as a draught animal for pulling a _p_l_o_u_g_h as a youngster, and at the
end of its useful life as _m_e_a_t). In this case the animals were normally milked
by hand and the herd size was quite small, so that all of the animals could be
milked in less than an hourâ€”about 10 per milker. These tasks were performed
by a dairymaid (dairywoman) or dairyman. The word dairy harkens back to Middle
English dayerie, deyerie, from deye (female servant or dairymaid) and further
back to Old English dÃ¦ge (kneader of bread).
With _i_n_d_u_s_t_r_i_a_l_i_s_a_t_i_o_n and _u_r_b_a_n_i_s_a_t_i_o_n, the supply of milk became a _c_o_m_m_e_r_c_i_a_l
_i_n_d_u_s_t_r_y, with specialised _b_r_e_e_d_s_ _o_f_ _c_a_t_t_l_e being developed for dairy, as
distinct from _b_e_e_f or _d_r_a_u_g_h_t animals. Initially, more people were employed as
milkers, but it soon turned to _m_e_c_h_a_n_i_s_a_t_i_o_n with machines designed to do the
milking.
Farmer milking a cow by hand.
Historically, the _m_i_l_k_i_n_g and the _p_r_o_c_e_s_s_i_n_g took place close together in space
and time: on a _d_a_i_r_y_ _f_a_r_m. People milked the animals by hand; on farms where
only small numbers are kept, hand-milking may still be practiced. Hand-milking
is accomplished by grasping the _t_e_a_t_s (often pronounced tit or tits) in the
hand and expressing milk either by squeezing the fingers progressively, from
the _u_d_d_e_r end to the tip, or by squeezing the teat between thumb and index
finger, then moving the hand downward from udder towards the end of the teat.
The action of the hand or fingers is designed to close off the milk duct at the
udder (upper) end and, by the movement of the fingers, close the duct
progressively to the tip to express the trapped milk. Each half or quarter of
the udder is emptied one milk-duct capacity at a time.
The stripping action is repeated, using both hands for speed. Both methods
result in the milk that was trapped in the _m_i_l_k_ _d_u_c_t being squirted out the end
into a bucket that is supported between the knees (or rests on the ground) of
the milker, who usually sits on a low stool.
Traditionally the cow, or cows, would stand in the _f_i_e_l_d or paddock while being
milked. Young stock, _h_e_i_f_e_r_s, would have to be trained to remain still to be
milked. In many countries, the cows were tethered to a post and milked. The
problem with this method is that it relies on quiet, tractable beasts, because
the hind end of the cow is not restrained.
In 1937, it was found that _b_o_v_i_n_e_ _s_o_m_a_t_o_t_r_o_p_i_n (BST or bovine growth hormone)
would increase the yield of milk. _M_o_n_s_a_n_t_o_ _C_o_m_p_a_n_y developed a synthetic
(recombinant) version of this hormone (rBST). In February 1994, rBST was
approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the U.S. It has
become common in the U.S., but not elsewhere, to inject it into milch kine
dairy cows to increase their production by up to 15%.
However, there are claims that this practice can have negative consequences for
the animals themselves. A _E_u_r_o_p_e_a_n_ _U_n_i_o_n scientific commission was asked to
report on the incidence of _m_a_s_t_i_t_i_s and other disorders in dairy cows, and on
other aspects of the welfare of dairy cows._[_1_] The commission's statement,
subsequently adopted by the European Union, stated that the use of rBST
substantially increased health problems with cows, including foot problems,
mastitis and injection site reactions, impinged on the welfare of the animals
and caused reproductive disorders. The report concluded that on the basis of
the health and welfare of the animals, rBST should not be used. _H_e_a_l_t_h_ _C_a_n_a_d_a
prohibited the sale of rBST in 1999; the recommendations of external committees
were that, despite not finding a significant health risk to humans, the drug
presented a threat to animal health and, for this reason, could not be sold in
_C_a_n_a_d_a._[_2_]

While most countries produce their own milk products, the structure of the
dairy industry varies in different parts of the world. In major milk-producing
countries most milk is distributed through whole sale markets. In Ireland and
Australia, for example, farmers' co-operatives own many of the large-scale
processors, while in the United States many farmers and processors do business
through individual contracts. In the United States, the country's 196 _f_a_r_m_e_r_s_'
_c_o_o_p_e_r_a_t_i_v_e_s sold 86% of milk in the U.S. in 2002, with five cooperatives
accounting for half that. This was down from 2,300 cooperatives in the 1940s.
_[_3_] In developing countries, the past practice of farmers marketing milk in
their own neighborhoods are changing rapidly. Notable developments include
considerable foreign investment in the dairy industry and a growing role for
dairy cooperatives. Output of milk is growing rapidly in such countries and
presents a major source of income growth for many farmers._[_4_]
As in many other branches of the food industry, dairy processing in the major
dairy producing countries has become increasingly concentrated, with fewer but
larger and more efficient plants operated by fewer workers. This is notably the
case in the United States, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. In 2009, charges
of _a_n_t_i_-_t_r_u_s_t violations have been made against major dairy industry players in
the United States._[_5_]
Government intervention in milk markets was common in the 20th century.A
limited anti-trust exemption was created for U.S. dairy cooperatives by the
_C_a_p_p_e_r_-_V_o_l_s_t_e_a_d_ _A_c_t of 1922. In the 1930s, some U.S. states adopted price
controls, and Federal Milk Marketing Orders started under the Agricultural
Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 and continue in the 2000s. The Federal Milk
Price Support Program began in 1949._[_3_] The _N_o_r_t_h_e_a_s_t_ _D_a_i_r_y_ _C_o_m_p_a_c_t regulated
wholesale milk prices in New England from 1997 to 2001._[_6_]
Plants producing liquid milk and products with short shelf life, such as
yogurts, creams and soft cheeses, tend to be located on the outskirts of urban
centres close to consumer markets. Plants manufacturing items with longer shelf
life, such as butter, milk powders, cheese and whey powders, tend to be
situated in rural areas closer to the milk supply. Most large processing plants
tend to specialise in a limited range of products. Exceptionally, however,
large plants producing a wide range of products are still common in Eastern
Europe, a holdover from the former centralized, supply-driven concept of the
market.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]
As processing plants grow fewer and larger, they tend to acquire bigger, more
automated and more efficient equipment. While this technological tendency keeps
manufacturing costs lower, the need for long-distance transportation often
increases the environmental impact._[_7_]
Milk production is irregular, depending on cow biology. Producers must adjust
the mix of milk which is sold in liquid form vs. processed foods (such as
butter and cheese) depending on changing supply and demand._[_3_]

When it became necessary to milk larger cows, the cows would be brought to a
_s_h_e_d or _b_a_r_n that was set up with _b_a_i_l_s (_s_t_a_l_l_s) where the cows could be
confined while they were milked. One person could milk more cows this way, as
many as 20 for a skilled worker. But having cows standing about in the yard and
shed waiting to be milked is not good for the cow, as she needs as much time in
the paddock grazing as is possible. It is usual to restrict the twice-daily
milking to a maximum of an hour and a half each time. It makes no difference
whether one milks 10 or 1000 cows, the milking time should not exceed a total
of about three hours each day for any cow.
As _h_e_r_d sizes increased there was more need to have efficient milking machines,
sheds, milk-storage facilities (_v_a_t_s), bulk-milk transport and shed cleaning
capabilities and the means of getting cows from paddock to shed and back.
Farmers found that cows would abandon their grazing area and walk towards the
milking area when the time came for milking. This is not surprising as, in the
flush of the milking season, cows presumably get very uncomfortable with udders
engorged with milk, and the place of relief for them is the milking shed.
As herd numbers increased so did the problems of _a_n_i_m_a_l_ _h_e_a_l_t_h. In _N_e_w_ _Z_e_a_l_a_n_d
two approaches to this problem have been used. The first was improved
_v_e_t_e_r_i_n_a_r_y_ _m_e_d_i_c_i_n_e_s (and the government regulation of the medicines) that the
farmer could use. The other was the creation of veterinary clubs where groups
of farmers would employ a _v_e_t_e_r_i_n_a_r_i_a_n (vet) full-time and share those services
throughout the year. It was in the vet's interest to keep the animals healthy
and reduce the number of calls from farmers, rather than to ensure that the
farmer needed to call for service and pay regularly.
Most dairy farmers milk their cows with absolute regularity at a minimum of
twice a day, with some high-producing herds milking up to four times a day to
lessen the weight of large volumes of milk in the udder of the cow. This daily
milking routine goes on for about 300 to 320 days per year that the cow stays
in milk. Some small herds are milked once a day for about the last 20 days of
the production cycle but this is not usual for large herds. If a cow is left
unmilked just once she is likely to reduce milk-production almost immediately
and the rest of the season may see her dried off (giving no milk) and still
consuming feed for no production. However, once-a-day milking is now being
practised more widely in New Zealand for profit and _l_i_f_e_s_t_y_l_e reasons. This is
effective because the fall in milk yield is at least partially offset by labour
and cost savings from milking once per day. This compares to some intensive
farm systems in the _U_n_i_t_e_d_ _S_t_a_t_e_s that milk three or more times per day due to
higher milk yields per cow and lower marginal _l_a_b_o_r_ _c_o_s_t_s.
Farmers who are contracted to supply liquid milk for human consumption (as
opposed to milk for processing into _b_u_t_t_e_r, _c_h_e_e_s_e, and so onâ€”see _m_i_l_k) often
have to manage their _h_e_r_d so that the contracted number of cows are in milk the
year round, or the required minimum milk output is maintained. This is done by
mating cows outside their natural mating time so that the period when each cow
in the herd is giving maximum production is in rotation throughout the year.
Northern hemisphere farmers who keep cows in barns almost all the year usually
manage their herds to give continuous production of milk so that they get paid
all year round. In the southern hemisphere the _c_o_o_p_e_r_a_t_i_v_e dairying systems
allow for two months on no productivity because their systems are designed to
take advantage of maximum grass and milk production in the spring and because
the milk processing plants pay bonuses in the dry (winter) season to carry the
farmers through the mid-winter break from milking. It also means that cows have
a rest from milk production when they are most heavily pregnant. Some year-
round milk farms are penalised financially for over-production at any time in

Dairy plants process the raw milk they receive from farmers so as to extend its
marketable life. Two main types of processes are employed: heat treatment to
ensure the safety of milk for human consumption and to lengthen its shelf-life,
and dehydrating dairy products such as butter, hard cheese and milk powders so
that they can be stored.

Today, milk is separated by huge machines in bulk into cream and skim milk. The
cream is processed to produce various consumer products, depending on its
thickness, its suitability for culinary uses and consumer demand, which differs
from place to place and country to country.
Some cream is dried and powdered, some is condensed (by _e_v_a_p_o_r_a_t_i_o_n) mixed with
varying amounts of _s_u_g_a_r and canned. Most cream from New Zealand and Australian
factories is made into _b_u_t_t_e_r. This is done by _c_h_u_r_n_i_n_g the cream until the fat
globules coagulate and form a monolithic mass. This butter mass is washed and,
sometimes, salted to improve keeping qualities. The residual _b_u_t_t_e_r_m_i_l_k goes on
to further processing. The butter is packaged (25 to 50 kg boxes) and chilled
for storage and sale. At a later stage these packages are broken down into
home-consumption sized packs.

The product left after the cream is removed is called skim, or skimmed, milk.To
make a consumable liquid a portion of cream is returned to the _s_k_i_m_ _m_i_l_k to
make _l_o_w_ _f_a_t milk (semi-skimmed) for human consumption. By varying the amount
of cream returned, producers can make a variety of low-fat milks to suit their
local market. Other products, such as _c_a_l_c_i_u_m, _v_i_t_a_m_i_n_ _D, and flavouring, are
also added to appeal to consumers

to the manufacture of products such as _f_a_b_r_i_c, _a_d_h_e_s_i_v_e_s, and _p_l_a_s_t_i_c_s.

_C_h_e_e_s_e is another product made from milk. Whole milk is reacted to form curds
that can be compressed, processed and stored to form cheese. In countries where
milk is legally allowed to be processed without _p_a_s_t_e_u_r_i_s_a_t_i_o_n a wide range of
cheeses can be made using the bacteria naturally in the milk. In most other
countries, the range of cheeses is smaller and the use of artificial cheese
curing is greater. Whey is also the byproduct of this process. Some people that
are lactose intolerant can eat certain types of cheese.

In earlier times whey was considered to be a waste product and it was, mostly,
fed to pigs as a convenient means of disposal. Beginning about 1950, and mostly
since about 1980, _l_a_c_t_o_s_e and many other products, mainly food additives, are
made from both casein and cheese whey.

Milk is also processed by various drying processes into powders. Whole milk,
skim milk, buttermilk, and whey products are dried into a powder form and used
for human and animal consumption. The main difference between production of
powders for human or for animal consumption is in the protection of the process
and the product from contamination. Some people drink milk reconstituted from
powdered milk, because milk is about 88% water and it is much cheaper to
transport the dried product.

Historically, the milking and the processing took place in the same place: on a
dairy farm. Later, cream was separated from the milk by machine, on the farm,
and the cream was transported to a _f_a_c_t_o_r_y for buttermaking. The skim milk was
fed to _p_i_g_s. This allowed for the high cost of transport (taking the smallest
volume high-value product), primitive trucks and the poor quality of roads.
Only farms close to factories could afford to take whole milk, which was
essential for cheesemaking in industrial quantities, to them.
Originally milk was originally distributed in '_p_a_i_l_s', a lidded bucket with a
handle. These proved impractical for transport by road or rail, and so the _m_i_l_k
_c_h_u_r_n was introduced, based on the tall conical shape of the _b_u_t_t_e_r_ _c_h_u_r_n.
Later large railway containers, such as the _B_r_i_t_i_s_h_ _R_a_i_l_w_a_y_ _M_i_l_k_ _T_a_n_k_ _W_a_g_o_n
were introduced, enabling the transport of larger quantities of milk, and over
longer distances.
The development of _r_e_f_r_i_g_e_r_a_t_i_o_n and better road transport, in the late 1950s,
has meant that most farmers milk their cows and only temporarily store the milk
in large refrigerated _b_u_l_k_ _t_a_n_k_s, from where it is later transported by truck
to central processing facilities.
In many European countries, particularly the _U_n_i_t_e_d_ _K_i_n_g_d_o_m, milk is then
delivered direct to customers' homes by a _m_i_l_k_ _f_l_o_a_t.

The milking machine extracts milk from all teats.
Milking machines are used to harvest milk from cows when manual milking becomes
inefficient or labour intensive. One early model was patented in 1907._[_8_] The
milking unit is the portion of a milking machine for removing milk from an
udder. It is made up of a claw, four teatcups, (Shells and rubber liners) long
milk tube, long pulsation tube, and a pulsator. The claw is an assembly that
connects the short pulse tubes and short milk tubes from the teatcups to the
long pulse tube and long milk tube. (Cluster assembly) Claws are commonly made
of stainless steel or plastic or both. Teatcups are composed of a rigid outer
shell (stainless steel or plastic) that holds a soft inner liner or inflation.
Transparent sections in the shell may allow viewing of liner collapse and milk
flow. The annular space between the shell and liner is called the pulse
chamber.
Milking machines work in a way that is different from hand milking or calf
suckling. Continuous vacuum is applied inside the soft liner to massage milk
from the teat by creating a pressure difference across the teat canal (or
opening at the end of the teat). Vacuum also helps keep the machine attached to
the cow. The vacuum applied to the teat causes congestion of teat tissues
(accumulation of blood and other fluids). Atmospheric air is admitted into the
pulsation chamber about once per second (the pulsation rate) to allow the liner
to collapse around the end of teat and relieve congestion in the teat tissue.
The ratio of the time that the liner is open (milking phase) and closed (rest
phase) is called the pulsation ratio.
The four streams of milk from the teatcups are usually combined in the claw and
transported to the milkline, or the collection bucket (usually sized to the
output of one cow) in a single milk hose. Milk is then transported (manually in
buckets) or with a combination of airflow and mechanical _p_u_m_p to a central
storage _v_a_t or _b_u_l_k_ _t_a_n_k. Milk is refrigerated on the farm in most countries
either by passing through a _h_e_a_t_-_e_x_c_h_a_n_g_e_r or in the bulk tank, or both.
The photo to the right shows a bucket milking system with the stainless steel
bucket visible on the far side of the cow. The two rigid stainless steel
teatcup shells applied to the front two quarters of the udder are visible. The
top of the flexible liner is visible at the top of the shells as are the short
milk tubes and short pulsation tubes extending from the bottom of the shells to
the claw. The bottom of the claw is transparent to allow observation of milk
flow. When milking is completed the vacuum to the milking unit is shut off and
the teatcups are removed.
Milking machines keep the milk enclosed and safe from external contamination.
The interior 'milk contact' surfaces of the machine are kept clean by a manual
or automated washing procedures implemented after milking is completed. Milk
contact surfaces must comply with regulations requiring food-grade materials
(typically _s_t_a_i_n_l_e_s_s_ _s_t_e_e_l and special plastics and rubber compounds) and are
easily cleaned.
Most milking machines are powered by _e_l_e_c_t_r_i_c_i_t_y but, in case of electrical
failure, there can be an alternative means of motive power, often an _i_n_t_e_r_n_a_l

This type of milking facility was the first development, after open-paddock
milking, for many farmers. The building was a long, narrow, lean-to shed that
was open along one long side. The cows were held in a yard at the open side and
when they were about to be milked they were positioned in one of the bails
(stalls). Usually the cows were restrained in the bail with a breech chain and
a rope to restrain the outer back leg. The cow could not move about excessively
and the milker could expect not to be kicked or trampled while sitting on a
(three-legged) stool and milking into a bucket. When each cow was finished she
backed out into the yard again. The UK bail, initially developed by Wiltshire
dairy farmer Arthur Hosier, was a six standing mobile shed with steps that the
cow mounted, so the herdsman didn't have to bend so low. The milking equipment
was much as today, a vacuum from a pump, pulsators, a claw-piece with pipes
leading to the four shells and liners that stimulate and suck the milk from the
teat. The milk went into churns, via a cooler.
As herd sizes increased a door was set into the front of each bail so that when
the milking was done for any cow the milker could, after undoing the leg-rope
and with a remote link, open the door and allow her to exit to the pasture. The
door was closed, the next cow walked into the bail and was secured. When
milking machines were introduced bails were set in pairs so that a cow was
being milked in one paired bail while the other could be prepared for milking.
When one was finished the machine's cups are swapped to the other cow. This is
the same as for Swingover Milking Parlours as described below except that the
cups are loaded on the udder from the side. As herd numbers increased it was
easier to double-up the cup-sets and milk both cows simultaneously than to
increase the number of bails. About 50 cows an hour can be milked in a shed
with 8 bales by one person. Using the same teat cups for successive cows has
the danger of transmitting infection, mastitis, from one cow to another. Some
farmers have devised their own ways to disinfect the clusters between cows.

In herringbone milking sheds, or parlours, cows enter, in single file, and line
up almost perpendicular to the central aisle of the milking parlour on both
sides of a central pit in which the milker works (you can visualise a fishbone
with the ribs representing the cows and the spine being the milker's working
area; the cows face outward). After washing the udder and teats the cups of the
milking machine are applied to the cows, from the rear of their hind legs, on
both sides of the working area. Large herringbone sheds can milk up to 600 cows
efficiently with two people.

Swingover parlours are the same as herringbone parlours except they have only
one set of milking cups to be shared between the two rows of cows, as one side
is being milked the cows on the other side are moved out and replaced with
unmilked ones. The advantage of this system is that it is less costly to equip,
however it operates at slightly better than half-speed and one would not
normally try to milk more than about 100 cows with one person.

Rotary milking sheds (also known as Rotary milking parlor) consist of a
turntable with about 12 to 100 individual stalls for cows around the outer
edge. A "good" rotary will be operated with 24â€“32 (~48â€“50+) stalls by one
(two) milkers. The turntable is turned by an electric-motor drive at a rate
that one turn is the time for a cow to be milked completely. As an empty stall
passes the entrance a cow steps on, facing the centre, and rotates with the
turntable. The next cow moves into the next vacant stall and so on. The
operator, or milker, cleans the teats, attaches the cups and does any other
feeding or whatever husbanding operations that are necessary. Cows are milked
as the platform rotates. The milker, or an automatic device, removes the
milking machine cups and the cow backs out and leaves at an exit just before
the entrance. The rotary system is capable of milking very large herdsâ€”over a
thousand cows.

voluntary milking (VM) method. These allow the cows to voluntarily present
themselves for milking at any time of the day or night, although repeat visits
may be limited by the farmer through computer software. A _r_o_b_o_t arm is used to
clean teats and apply milking equipment, while automated gates direct cow
traffic, eliminating the need for the farmer to be present during the process.

Farmers soon realised that a milking shed was a good place to feed cows
supplementary foods that overcame local dietary deficiencies or added to the
cows' wellbeing and production. Each bail might have a box into which such feed
is delivered as the cow arrives so that she is eating while being milked. A
computer can read the eartag of each animal to ration the correct individual
supplement. A close alternative is to use 'out-of-parlour-feeders', stalls that
respond to a transponder around the cow's neck that is programmed to provide
each cow with a supplementary feed, the quantity dependent on her production,
stage in lactation, and the benefits of the main ration
The holding yard at the entrance of the shed is important as a means of keeping
cows moving into the shed. Most yards have a powered gate that ensures that the
cows are kept close to the shed.
_W_a_t_e_r is a vital commodity on a dairy farm: cows drink about 20 gallons (80
litres) a day, sheds need water to cool and clean them. Pumps and reservoirs
are common at milking facilities. Water can be warmed by heat transfer with
milk.

Milk coming from the cow is transported to a nearby storage vessel by the
airflow leaking around the cups on the cow or by a special "air inlet" (5-10 l/
min free air) in the claw. From there it is pumped by a mechanical pump and
cooled by a _h_e_a_t_ _e_x_c_h_a_n_g_e_r. The milk is then stored in a large vat, or _b_u_l_k

In countries where cows are grazed outside year-round, there is little waste
disposal to deal with. The most concentrated waste is at the milking shed,
where the animal waste is liquefied (during the water-washing process) and
allowed to flow by gravity, or pumped, into _c_o_m_p_o_s_t_i_n_g ponds with _a_n_a_e_r_o_b_i_c
_b_a_c_t_e_r_i_a to consume the solids. The processed water and nutrients are then
pumped back onto the pasture as _i_r_r_i_g_a_t_i_o_n and _f_e_r_t_i_l_i_z_e_r.
In areas where cows are housed all year round, the waste problem is difficult
because of the amount of feed that is brought in and the amount of bedding
material that also has to be removed and composted.
In the associated milk processing factories, most of the waste is washing water
that is treated, usually by composting, and returned to waterways. This is much
different from half a century ago, when the main products were butter, cheese
and casein, and the rest of the milk had to be disposed of as waste (sometimes
as animal feed).
In many cases, modern farms have very large quantities of milk to be
transported to a factory for processing. If anything goes wrong with the
milking, transport or processing facilities it can be a major disaster trying
to dispose of enormous quantities of milk. If a road _t_a_n_k_e_r overturns on a
road, the rescue crew is looking at accommodating the spill of 5 to 10 thousand
gallons of milk (20 to 45 thousand litres) without allowing any into the
waterways. A derailed rail _t_a_n_k_e_r_-_t_r_a_i_n may involve 10 times that amount.
Without refrigeration, milk is a fragile commodity, and it is very damaging to
the environment in its raw state due to its high _b_i_o_c_h_e_m_i_c_a_l_ _o_x_y_g_e_n_ _d_e_m_a_n_d.
[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] A widespread electrical power _b_l_a_c_k_o_u_t is another disaster
for the dairy industry, because both milking and processing facilities are
affected. For this, farms may often use mobile generators. Such a situation
occurred during the power outage caused by the _2_0_1_0_ _C_a_n_t_e_r_b_u_r_y_ _E_a_r_t_h_q_u_a_k_e.

In dairy-intensive areas, various methods have been proposed for disposing of
large quantities of milk. These directives include feeding milk to livestock,
spray irrigation or designating a sacrifice area.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] Large
application rates of milk onto land, or disposing in a hole, is problematic as
the residue from the decomposing milk will block the soil pores and thereby
reduce the water infiltration rate through the soil profile. As recovery of
this effect can take time, any land based application needs to be well managed
and considered._[_1_0_]

Some groups avoid dairy for non-health related reasons:
    * Religious - Some religions restrict or do not allow for the consumption
      of dairy. For example, some scholars of _J_a_i_n_i_s_m advocate not consuming
      any dairy because dairy is perceived to involve violence against cows.
      Strict _J_u_d_a_i_s_m requires that meat and dairy to not be served at the same
      meal, served or cooked in the same utensils, or stored together as
      prescribed in _D_e_u_t_e_r_o_n_o_m_y_ _1_4_:_2_1.
    * Ethical - _V_e_g_a_n_i_s_m is defined as the avoidance of all animal products,
      including dairy, most often due to the ethics regarding how dairy is
      produced. The _e_t_h_i_c_a_l_ _r_e_a_s_o_n_s_ _f_o_r_ _a_v_o_i_d_i_n_g_ _d_a_i_r_y include how dairy is

      dairy production.
