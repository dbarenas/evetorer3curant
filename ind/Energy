Energy transformation; In a typical _l_i_g_h_t_n_i_n_g strike, 500 _m_e_g_a_j_o_u_l_e_s of
_e_l_e_c_t_r_i_c_ _p_o_t_e_n_t_i_a_l_ _e_n_e_r_g_y is converted into the same amount of energy in other
forms, most notably _l_i_g_h_t_ _e_n_e_r_g_y, _s_o_u_n_d_ _e_n_e_r_g_y and _t_h_e_r_m_a_l_ _e_n_e_r_g_y.
In _p_h_y_s_i_c_s, eenneerrggyy is a _c_o_n_s_e_r_v_e_d _e_x_t_e_n_s_i_v_e property of a physical system,
which cannot be observed directly but can be calculated from its _s_t_a_t_e. Energy
is of central importance in physics. It is impossible to give a comprehensive
definition of energy because of the many forms it may take, but the most common
definition is that it is the capacity of a system to perform _w_o_r_k. The
definition of work in physics is the movement of a _f_o_r_c_e through a _d_i_s_t_a_n_c_e,
and energy is measured in the same units as work. If a person pushes an object
x _m_e_t_e_r_s against an opposing force of F _n_e_w_t_o_n_s, Fx _j_o_u_l_e_s (newton-meters) of
work has been done on the object; the person's body has lost Fx joules of
energy, and the object has gained Fx joules of energy. The _S_I unit of energy is
the _j_o_u_l_e (J) (equivalent to a newton-meter or a _w_a_t_t-second); the _C_G_S unit is
the _e_r_g, and the _I_m_p_e_r_i_a_l unit is the _f_o_o_t_ _p_o_u_n_d. Other energy units such as
the _e_l_e_c_t_r_o_n_ _v_o_l_t, _c_a_l_o_r_i_e, _B_T_U, and _k_i_l_o_w_a_t_t_-_h_o_u_r (1 kWh = 3600 kJ) are used
in specific areas of science and commerce.
One reason for the importance of energy in physics is that it is a _c_o_n_s_e_r_v_e_d
_q_u_a_n_t_i_t_y: the _l_a_w_ _o_f_ _c_o_n_s_e_r_v_a_t_i_o_n_ _o_f_ _e_n_e_r_g_y states that energy can neither be
created nor destroyed, but it can be changed into different forms. The sum of
all the forms of energy inside a volume of space can only change by the amount
of energy leaving or entering the volume. Another reason for its importance is
the number of different forms that energy can take. Two major categories of
energy are kinetic and potential. _K_i_n_e_t_i_c_ _e_n_e_r_g_y is energy of motion, carried
by a moving mass such as a thrown baseball. _P_o_t_e_n_t_i_a_l_ _e_n_e_r_g_y is energy
possessed by an object due to its position in a force _f_i_e_l_d, such as a
_g_r_a_v_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_a_l, _e_l_e_c_t_r_i_c or _m_a_g_n_e_t_i_c_ _f_i_e_l_d. For example, lifting an object
against gravity stores gravitational potential energy in it, which is converted
to kinetic energy if it falls. Specific forms of energy include the _r_a_d_i_a_n_t
_e_n_e_r_g_y of _e_l_e_c_t_r_o_m_a_g_n_e_t_i_c_ _w_a_v_e_s such as light, _e_l_a_s_t_i_c_ _e_n_e_r_g_y due to the
stretching or deformation of solid objects, _c_h_e_m_i_c_a_l_ _e_n_e_r_g_y such as is released
when a fuel burns, and _t_h_e_r_m_a_l_ _e_n_e_r_g_y, the microscopic kinetic and potential
energies of the random motions of the particles making up matter.
Not all of the energy in a system can be converted into work, however. The
quantity of energy of a system that can be converted to work is called the
_a_v_a_i_l_a_b_l_e_ _e_n_e_r_g_y. Thermal energy has a special status; as the most disordered,
highest _e_n_t_r_o_p_y form of energy, the _s_e_c_o_n_d_ _l_a_w_ _o_f_ _t_h_e_r_m_o_d_y_n_a_m_i_c_s limits the
amount of thermal energy that can be converted into other forms of energy.
Any object that has mass when stationary (thus called _r_e_s_t_ _m_a_s_s), _e_q_u_i_v_a_l_e_n_t_l_y
has _r_e_s_t_ _e_n_e_r_g_y as can be calculated using _A_l_b_e_r_t_ _E_i_n_s_t_e_i_n's equation E = mc2.
Rest energy, being a form of energy, can be changed to or from other forms of
energy. As with any energy transformation, the total amount of energy does not
increase or decrease in such a process. From this perspective, the amount of
matter in the universe contributes to its total energy.
Similarly, all energy manifests as an equivalent amount of mass. For example,
adding 25 kilowatt-hours (90 megajoules) of any form of energy to an object
increases its mass by 1 microgram. If you had a sensitive enough mass balance
or _s_c_a_l_e, this mass increase could be measured. Our Sun (or a nuclear bomb)
converts _n_u_c_l_e_a_r_ _p_o_t_e_n_t_i_a_l_ _e_n_e_r_g_y to other forms of energy; its total mass
doesn't decrease due to that in itself because it still contains the same total
energy in different forms, but its mass does decrease when the energy escapes
out to its surroundings, largely as _r_a_d_i_a_n_t_ _e_n_e_r_g_y.
Additional exotic forms of energy permeate all space, including otherwise empty
space. For example, all space contains a small random energy density called the
_z_e_r_o_ _p_o_i_n_t_ _e_n_e_r_g_y.
Energy is necessary for things to change. All living things require _a_v_a_i_l_a_b_l_e
_e_n_e_r_g_y to stay alive; humans get such energy from _f_o_o_d, along with the oxygen
needed to metabolize the food. Human civilization requires a continual supply
of energy to function, _e_n_e_r_g_y_ _r_e_s_o_u_r_c_e_s such as _f_o_s_s_i_l_ _f_u_e_l_s are a vital topic
in economics and politics. Earth's _c_l_i_m_a_t_e and _e_c_o_s_y_s_t_e_m are driven by the
radiant energy Earth receives from the sun, and are delicately sensitive to
changes in the amount received.

Heat and work are special cases in that they are not properties of systems but
of processes that transfer energy. In general we cannot measure how much heat
or work are present in an object, but rather only how much energy is
transferred among objects in certain ways during the occurrence of a given
process.
Types of energy may be classified. Some in the above list may constitute or
comprise others in the list. Types of stored eenneerrggyy that are dependent upon
_f_u_n_d_a_m_e_n_t_a_l_ _f_o_r_c_e_s_ _o_f_ _n_a_t_u_r_e, are called _p_o_t_e_n_t_i_a_l_ _e_n_e_r_g_y. Potential energy is
stored in the arrangement of objects or particles that are under the influence
of a particular type of force (force field, or field). These include
gravitational energy (which is stored in the way masses are arranged in a
gravitational field), several types of nuclear energy (which utilize potentials
from the _n_u_c_l_e_a_r_ _f_o_r_c_e and the _w_e_a_k_ _f_o_r_c_e), electrical energy (from the
_e_l_e_c_t_r_i_c_ _f_i_e_l_d), and magnetic energy (from the _m_a_g_n_e_t_i_c_ _f_i_e_l_d).
Other familiar types of energy are a varying mix of both potential and kinetic
energy. An example is _m_e_c_h_a_n_i_c_a_l_ _e_n_e_r_g_y which is the sum of (usually
macroscopic) kinetic and potential energy in a system. Elastic energy in
materials is also dependent upon electrical potential energy (among atoms and
molecules), as is chemical energy, which is stored and released from a
reservoir of electrical potential energy between electrons, and the molecules
or atomic nuclei that attract them.[_n_e_e_d_ _q_u_o_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _t_o_ _v_e_r_i_f_y].
_C_l_a_s_s_i_c_a_l_ _m_e_c_h_a_n_i_c_s distinguishes between _p_o_t_e_n_t_i_a_l_ _e_n_e_r_g_y, which is a function
of the position of an object within a _f_i_e_l_d, and _k_i_n_e_t_i_c_ _e_n_e_r_g_y, which is a
function of its _m_o_v_e_m_e_n_t. Both position and movement are relative to a _f_r_a_m_e_ _o_f
_r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e, which must be specified: this is often (and originally) an arbitrary
fixed point on the surface of the Earth, the terrestrial frame of reference
[_n_e_e_d_ _q_u_o_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _t_o_ _v_e_r_i_f_y].
It has been attempted to categorize all forms of energy as either kinetic or
potential, but as _R_i_c_h_a_r_d_ _F_e_y_n_m_a_n points out:
     These notions of potential and kinetic energy depend on a notion of
     length scale. For example, one can speak of macroscopic potential and
     kinetic energy, which do not include thermal potential and kinetic
     energy. Also what is called chemical potential energy is a
     macroscopic notion, and closer examination shows that it is really
     the sum of the potential and kinetic energy on the atomic and
     subatomic scale. Similar remarks apply to nuclear "potential" energy
     and most other forms of energy. This dependence on length scale is
     non-problematic if the various length scales are decoupled, as is
     often the case ... but confusion can arise when different length
     scales are coupled, for instance when friction converts macroscopic
     work into microscopic thermal energy.
Energy may be _t_r_a_n_s_f_o_r_m_e_d between different forms at various _e_f_f_i_c_i_e_n_c_i_e_s.
Items that transform between these forms are called _t_r_a_n_s_d_u_c_e_r_s.

Thomas Young ‚Äì the first to use the term "energy" in the modern sense.
The word energy derives from the Greek ·ºêŒΩŒ≠œÅŒ≥ŒµŒπŒ± _e_n_e_r_g_e_i_a, which
possibly appears for the first time in the work of _A_r_i_s_t_o_t_l_e in the 4th century
_B_C_E. (_A_n_c_i_e_n_t_ _G_r_e_e_k: ·ºêŒΩŒ≠œÅŒ≥ŒµŒπŒ± _e_n_e_r_g_e_i_a "activity, operation"_[_1_])
The concept of energy emerged out of the idea of _v_i_s_ _v_i_v_a (living force), which
_G_o_t_t_f_r_i_e_d_ _L_e_i_b_n_i_z defined as the product of the mass of an object and its
velocity squared; he believed that total vis viva was conserved. To account for
slowing due to friction, Leibniz theorized that thermal energy consisted of the
random motion of the constituent parts of matter, a view shared by _I_s_a_a_c
_N_e_w_t_o_n, although it would be more than a century until this was generally
accepted.
In 1807, _T_h_o_m_a_s_ _Y_o_u_n_g was possibly the first to use the term "energy" instead
of vis viva, in its modern sense._[_2_] _G_u_s_t_a_v_e_-_G_a_s_p_a_r_d_ _C_o_r_i_o_l_i_s described
"_k_i_n_e_t_i_c_ _e_n_e_r_g_y" in 1829 in its modern sense, and in 1853, _W_i_l_l_i_a_m_ _R_a_n_k_i_n_e
coined the term "_p_o_t_e_n_t_i_a_l_ _e_n_e_r_g_y".
The law of _c_o_n_s_e_r_v_a_t_i_o_n_ _o_f_ _e_n_e_r_g_y, was first postulated in the early 19th
century, and applies to any _i_s_o_l_a_t_e_d_ _s_y_s_t_e_m. According to _N_o_e_t_h_e_r_'_s_ _t_h_e_o_r_e_m,
the conservation of energy is a consequence of the fact that the laws of
physics do not change over time._[_3_] Since 1918 it has been known that the law
of _c_o_n_s_e_r_v_a_t_i_o_n_ _o_f_ _e_n_e_r_g_y is the direct mathematical consequence of the
_t_r_a_n_s_l_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _s_y_m_m_e_t_r_y of the quantity _c_o_n_j_u_g_a_t_e to energy, namely _t_i_m_e.
It was argued for some years whether energy was a substance (the _c_a_l_o_r_i_c) or
merely a physical quantity, such as _m_o_m_e_n_t_u_m. In 1845 _J_a_m_e_s_ _P_r_e_s_c_o_t_t_ _J_o_u_l_e
discovered the link between mechanical work and the generation of heat. This
led to the theory of conservation of energy, and development of the first law
of thermodynamics.
Finally, William Thomson (_L_o_r_d_ _K_e_l_v_i_n) amalgamated these many discoveries into
the laws of _t_h_e_r_m_o_d_y_n_a_m_i_c_s, which aided the rapid development of explanations
of chemical processes by _R_u_d_o_l_f_ _C_l_a_u_s_i_u_s, _J_o_s_i_a_h_ _W_i_l_l_a_r_d_ _G_i_b_b_s, and _W_a_l_t_h_e_r
_N_e_r_n_s_t. It also led to a mathematical formulation of the concept of _e_n_t_r_o_p_y by
Clausius and to the introduction of laws of _r_a_d_i_a_n_t_ _e_n_e_r_g_y by _J_o_≈_æ_e_f_ _S_t_e_f_a_n.
During a 1961 lecture_[_4_] for undergraduate students at the _C_a_l_i_f_o_r_n_i_a_ _I_n_s_t_i_t_u_t_e
_o_f_ _T_e_c_h_n_o_l_o_g_y, _R_i_c_h_a_r_d_ _F_e_y_n_m_a_n, a celebrated physics teacher and _N_o_b_e_l
_L_a_u_r_e_a_t_e, said this about the concept of energy:
     There is a fact, or if you wish, a law, governing all natural
     phenomena that are known to date. There is no known exception to this
     law‚Äîit is exact so far as we know. The law is called the
     _c_o_n_s_e_r_v_a_t_i_o_n_ _o_f_ _e_n_e_r_g_y. It states that there is a certain quantity,
     which we call energy, that does not change in manifold changes which
     nature undergoes. That is a most abstract idea, because it is a
     mathematical principle; it says that there is a numerical quantity
     which does not change when something happens. It is not a description
     of a mechanism, or anything concrete; it is just a strange fact that
     we can calculate some number and when we finish watching nature go
     through her tricks and calculate the number again, it is the same.

Energy, like mass, is a _s_c_a_l_a_r physical quantity. The _j_o_u_l_e is the
_I_n_t_e_r_n_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _S_y_s_t_e_m_ _o_f_ _U_n_i_t_s (SI) unit of measurement for energy. It is a
derived unit of energy, work, or amount of heat. It is equal to the energy
expended (or _w_o_r_k done) in applying a force of one newton through a distance of
one metre. However energy is also expressed in many other units such as _e_r_g_s,
_c_a_l_o_r_i_e_s, _B_r_i_t_i_s_h_ _T_h_e_r_m_a_l_ _U_n_i_t_s, _k_i_l_o_w_a_t_t_-_h_o_u_r_s and _k_i_l_o_c_a_l_o_r_i_e_s for instance.
There is always a conversion factor for these to the SI unit; for instance; one
kWh is equivalent to 3.6 million joules._[_5_]

Work, a form of energy, is force times distance.
      [ W = \int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathrm{d} \mathbf{s}]
This says that the work ([W]) is equal to the _l_i_n_e_ _i_n_t_e_g_r_a_l of the _f_o_r_c_e FF
along a path C; for details see the _m_e_c_h_a_n_i_c_a_l_ _w_o_r_k article.
Work and thus energy is _f_r_a_m_e_ _d_e_p_e_n_d_e_n_t. For example, consider a ball being hit
by a bat. In the center-of-mass reference frame, the bat does no work on the
ball. But, in the reference frame of the person swinging the bat, considerable
work is done on the ball.

In the context of _c_h_e_m_i_s_t_r_y, energy is an attribute of a substance as a
consequence of its atomic, molecular or aggregate structure. Since a chemical
transformation is accompanied by a change in one or more of these kinds of
structure, it is invariably accompanied by an increase or decrease of energy of
the substances involved. Some energy is transferred between the surroundings
and the reactants of the reaction in the form of heat or light; thus the
products of a reaction may have more or less energy than the reactants. A
reaction is said to be _e_x_e_r_g_o_n_i_c if the final state is lower on the energy
scale than the initial state; in the case of _e_n_d_e_r_g_o_n_i_c reactions the situation
is the reverse. _C_h_e_m_i_c_a_l_ _r_e_a_c_t_i_o_n_s are invariably not possible unless the
reactants surmount an energy barrier known as the _a_c_t_i_v_a_t_i_o_n_ _e_n_e_r_g_y. The speed
of a chemical reaction (at given temperature T) is related to the activation
energy E, by the Boltzmann's population factor e‚àíE/kT ‚Äì that is the
probability of molecule to have energy greater than or equal to E at the given
temperature T. This exponential dependence of a reaction rate on temperature is
known as the _A_r_r_h_e_n_i_u_s_ _e_q_u_a_t_i_o_n.The activation energy necessary for a chemical
reaction can be in the form of thermal energy.

In _b_i_o_l_o_g_y, energy is an attribute of all biological systems from the biosphere
to the smallest living _o_r_g_a_n_i_s_m. Within an organism it is responsible for
growth and development of a biological _c_e_l_l or an _o_r_g_a_n_e_l_l_e of a biological
_o_r_g_a_n_i_s_m. Energy is thus often said to be stored by _c_e_l_l_s in the structures of
molecules of substances such as _c_a_r_b_o_h_y_d_r_a_t_e_s (including sugars), _l_i_p_i_d_s, and
_p_r_o_t_e_i_n_s, which release energy when reacted with _o_x_y_g_e_n in _r_e_s_p_i_r_a_t_i_o_n. In
human terms, the _h_u_m_a_n_ _e_q_u_i_v_a_l_e_n_t (H-e) (Human energy conversion) indicates,
for a given amount of energy expenditure, the relative quantity of energy
needed for human _m_e_t_a_b_o_l_i_s_m, assuming an average human energy expenditure of
12,500kJ per day and a _b_a_s_a_l_ _m_e_t_a_b_o_l_i_c_ _r_a_t_e of 80 watts. For example, if our
bodies run (on average) at 80 watts, then a light bulb running at 100 watts is
running at 1.25 human equivalents (100 √∑ 80) i.e. 1.25 H-e. For a difficult
task of only a few seconds' duration, a person can put out thousands of watts,
many times the 746 watts in one official horsepower. For tasks lasting a few
minutes, a fit human can generate perhaps 1,000 watts. For an activity that
must be sustained for an hour, output drops to around 300; for an activity kept
up all day, 150 watts is about the maximum._[_6_] The human equivalent assists
understanding of energy flows in physical and biological systems by expressing
energy units in human terms: it provides a ‚Äúfeel‚Äù for the use of a given
amount of energy_[_7_]

Any living organism relies on an external source of energy‚Äîradiation from the
Sun in the case of green plants; chemical energy in some form in the case of
animals‚Äîto be able to grow and reproduce. The daily 1500‚Äì2000 _C_a_l_o_r_i_e_s
(6‚Äì8 MJ) recommended for a human adult are taken as a combination of oxygen
and food molecules, the latter mostly carbohydrates and fats, of which _g_l_u_c_o_s_e
(C6H12O6) and _s_t_e_a_r_i_n (C57H110O6) are convenient examples. The food molecules
are oxidised to _c_a_r_b_o_n_ _d_i_o_x_i_d_e and _w_a_t_e_r in the _m_i_t_o_c_h_o_n_d_r_i_a

radiation), and it is true that most real _m_a_c_h_i_n_e_s manage higher efficiencies.
In growing organisms the energy that is converted to heat serves a vital
purpose, as it allows the organism tissue to be highly ordered with regard to

energy (and matter) tends to become more evenly spread out across the universe:
to concentrate energy (or matter) in one specific place, it is necessary to
spread out a greater amount of energy (as heat) across the remainder of the
universe ("the surroundings")._[_1_0_] Simpler organisms can achieve higher energy
efficiencies than more complex ones, but the complex organisms can occupy

The concept of energy and its _t_r_a_n_s_f_o_r_m_a_t_i_o_n_s is vital in explaining and
predicting most natural phenomena. One form of energy can often be readily
transformed into another; for instance, a battery, from _c_h_e_m_i_c_a_l_ _e_n_e_r_g_y to
_e_l_e_c_t_r_i_c_ _e_n_e_r_g_y; a _d_a_m: _g_r_a_v_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _p_o_t_e_n_t_i_a_l_ _e_n_e_r_g_y to _k_i_n_e_t_i_c_ _e_n_e_r_g_y of
moving _w_a_t_e_r (and the blades of a _t_u_r_b_i_n_e) and ultimately to _e_l_e_c_t_r_i_c_ _e_n_e_r_g_y
through an _e_l_e_c_t_r_i_c_ _g_e_n_e_r_a_t_o_r.
There are strict limits to how efficiently energy can be converted into other
forms of energy via _w_o_r_k, and _h_e_a_t as described by _C_a_r_n_o_t_'_s_ _t_h_e_o_r_e_m and the
_s_e_c_o_n_d_ _l_a_w_ _o_f_ _t_h_e_r_m_o_d_y_n_a_m_i_c_s. These limits are especially evident when an
engine is used to perform work. Some _e_n_e_r_g_y_ _t_r_a_n_s_f_o_r_m_a_t_i_o_n_s can be quite
efficient.
The direction of transformations in energy (what kind of energy is transformed
to what other kind) is often described by _e_n_t_r_o_p_y (equal energy spread among
all available _d_e_g_r_e_e_s_ _o_f_ _f_r_e_e_d_o_m) considerations, as in practice all energy
transformations are permitted on a small scale, but certain larger
transformations are not permitted because it is statistically unlikely that
energy or matter will randomly move into more concentrated forms or smaller
spaces.
Energy transformations in the universe over time are characterized by various
kinds of potential energy that has been available since the _B_i_g_ _B_a_n_g, later
being "released" (transformed to more active types of energy such as kinetic or
radiant energy), when a triggering mechanism is available. Familiar examples of
such processes include nuclear decay, in which energy is released that was
originally "stored" in heavy isotopes (such as _u_r_a_n_i_u_m and _t_h_o_r_i_u_m), by
_n_u_c_l_e_o_s_y_n_t_h_e_s_i_s, a process ultimately using the gravitational potential energy
released from the _g_r_a_v_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _c_o_l_l_a_p_s_e of _s_u_p_e_r_n_o_v_a_e, to store energy in the
creation of these heavy elements before they were incorporated into the solar
system and the Earth. This energy is triggered and released in nuclear _f_i_s_s_i_o_n
_b_o_m_b_s or in civil nuclear power generation.
Similarly, in the case of a _c_h_e_m_i_c_a_l_ _e_x_p_l_o_s_i_o_n, _c_h_e_m_i_c_a_l_ _p_o_t_e_n_t_i_a_l energy is
transformed to _k_i_n_e_t_i_c_ _e_n_e_r_g_y and _t_h_e_r_m_a_l_ _e_n_e_r_g_y in a very short time. Yet
another example is that of a _p_e_n_d_u_l_u_m. At its highest points the _k_i_n_e_t_i_c_ _e_n_e_r_g_y
is zero and the _g_r_a_v_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _p_o_t_e_n_t_i_a_l_ _e_n_e_r_g_y is at maximum. At its lowest
point the _k_i_n_e_t_i_c_ _e_n_e_r_g_y is at maximum and is equal to the decrease of
_p_o_t_e_n_t_i_a_l_ _e_n_e_r_g_y. If one (unrealistically) assumes that there is no _f_r_i_c_t_i_o_n or
other losses, the conversion of energy between these processes would be
perfect, and the _p_e_n_d_u_l_u_m would continue swinging forever.

Energy gives rise to weight when it is trapped in a system with zero momentum,
where it can be weighed. It is also equivalent to mass, and this mass is always
associated with it. Mass is also equivalent to a certain amount of energy, and
likewise always appears associated with it, as described in _m_a_s_s_-_e_n_e_r_g_y
_e_q_u_i_v_a_l_e_n_c_e. The formula E = mc¬≤, derived by _A_l_b_e_r_t_ _E_i_n_s_t_e_i_n (1905) quantifies
the relationship between rest-mass and rest-energy within the concept of
special relativity. In different theoretical frameworks, similar formulas were
derived by _J_._ _J_._ _T_h_o_m_s_o_n (1881), _H_e_n_r_i_ _P_o_i_n_c_a_r_√_© (1900), _F_r_i_e_d_r_i_c_h_ _H_a_s_e_n_√_∂_h_r_l
(1904) and others (see _M_a_s_s_-_e_n_e_r_g_y_ _e_q_u_i_v_a_l_e_n_c_e_#_H_i_s_t_o_r_y for further
information).
_M_a_t_t_e_r may be destroyed and converted to energy (and vice versa), but mass
cannot ever be destroyed; rather, mass remains a constant for both the matter
and the energy, during any process when they are converted into each other.
However, since [c^2] is extremely large relative to ordinary human scales, the
conversion of ordinary amount of _m_a_t_t_e_r (for example, 1 kg) to other forms of
energy (such as heat, light, and other radiation) can liberate tremendous
amounts of energy (~[9\times 10^{16}] joules = 21 megatons of TNT), as can be
seen in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. Conversely, the mass equivalent
of a unit of energy is minuscule, which is why a loss of energy (loss of mass)
from most systems is difficult to measure by weight, unless the energy loss is
very large. Examples of energy transformation into matter (i.e., kinetic energy
into particles with rest mass) are found in high-energy _n_u_c_l_e_a_r_ _p_h_y_s_i_c_s.

Transformation of energy into useful work is a core topic of thermodynamics. In
nature, transformations of energy can be fundamentally classed into two kinds:
those that are thermodynamically _r_e_v_e_r_s_i_b_l_e, and those that are
thermodynamically _i_r_r_e_v_e_r_s_i_b_l_e. A _r_e_v_e_r_s_i_b_l_e_ _p_r_o_c_e_s_s_ _i_n_ _t_h_e_r_m_o_d_y_n_a_m_i_c_s is one
in which no energy is dissipated (spread) into empty energy states available in
a volume, from which it cannot be recovered into more concentrated forms (fewer
quantum states), without degradation of even more energy. A reversible process
is one in which this sort of dissipation does not happen. For example,
conversion of energy from one type of potential field to another, is
reversible, as in the pendulum system described above. In processes where heat
is generated, quantum states of lower energy, present as possible excitations
in fields between atoms, act as a reservoir for part of the energy, from which
it cannot be recovered, in order to be converted with 100% efficiency into
other forms of energy. In this case, the energy must partly stay as heat, and
cannot be completely recovered as usable energy, except at the price of an
increase in some other kind of heat-like increase in disorder in quantum
states, in the universe (such as an expansion of matter, or a randomization in
a crystal).

As the universe evolves in time, more and more of its energy becomes trapped in
irreversible states (i.e., as heat or other kinds of increases in disorder).
This has been referred to as the inevitable thermodynamic _h_e_a_t_ _d_e_a_t_h_ _o_f_ _t_h_e
_u_n_i_v_e_r_s_e. In this heat death the energy of the universe does not change, but
the fraction of energy which is available to do work through a _h_e_a_t_ _e_n_g_i_n_e, or
be transformed to other usable forms of energy (through the use of generators
attached to heat engines), grows less and less.
In a slower process, _r_a_d_i_o_a_c_t_i_v_e_ _d_e_c_a_y of these atoms in the core of the Earth
releases heat. This thermal energy drives _p_l_a_t_e_ _t_e_c_t_o_n_i_c_s and may lift
mountains, via _o_r_o_g_e_n_e_s_i_s. This slow lifting represents a kind of gravitational
potential energy storage of the thermal energy, which may be later released to
active kinetic energy in landslides, after a triggering event. Earthquakes also
release stored elastic potential energy in rocks, a store that has been
produced ultimately from the same radioactive heat sources. Thus, according to
present understanding, familiar events such as landslides and earthquakes
release energy that has been stored as potential energy in the Earth's
gravitational field or elastic strain (mechanical potential energy) in rocks.
Prior to this, they represent release of energy that has been stored in heavy
atoms since the collapse of long-destroyed supernova stars created these atoms.
In another similar chain of transformations beginning at the dawn of the
universe, _n_u_c_l_e_a_r_ _f_u_s_i_o_n of hydrogen in the Sun also releases another store of
potential energy which was created at the time of the _B_i_g_ _B_a_n_g. At that time,
according to theory, space expanded and the universe cooled too rapidly for
hydrogen to completely fuse into heavier elements. This meant that hydrogen
represents a store of potential energy that can be released by _f_u_s_i_o_n. Such a
fusion process is triggered by heat and pressure generated from gravitational
collapse of hydrogen clouds when they produce stars, and some of the fusion
energy is then transformed into sunlight. Such sunlight from our Sun may again
be stored as gravitational potential energy after it strikes the Earth, as (for
example) water evaporates from oceans and is deposited upon mountains (where,
after being released at a hydroelectric dam, it can be used to drive turbines
or generators to produce electricity). Sunlight also drives many weather
phenomena, save those generated by volcanic events.
An example of a solar-mediated weather event is a hurricane, which occurs when
large unstable areas of warm ocean, heated over months, give up some of their
thermal energy suddenly to power a few days of violent air movement. Sunlight
is also captured by plants as chemical potential energy in _p_h_o_t_o_s_y_n_t_h_e_s_i_s, when
carbon dioxide and water (two low-energy compounds) are converted into the
high-energy compounds carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. Plants also release
oxygen during photosynthesis, which is utilized by living organisms as an
_e_l_e_c_t_r_o_n_ _a_c_c_e_p_t_o_r, to release the energy of carbohydrates, lipids, and
proteins. Release of the energy stored during photosynthesis as heat or light
may be triggered suddenly by a spark, in a forest fire, or it may be made
available more slowly for animal or human metabolism, when these molecules are
ingested, and _c_a_t_a_b_o_l_i_s_m is triggered by _e_n_z_y_m_e action.
Through all of these transformation chains, potential energy stored at the time
of the Big Bang is later released by intermediate events, sometimes being
stored in a number of ways over time between releases, as more active energy.
In all these events, one kind of energy is converted to other types of energy,
including heat.

Energy is subject to the law of conservation of energy. According to this law,
energy can neither be created (produced) nor destroyed by itself. It can only
be transformed.
Most kinds of energy (with gravitational energy being a notable exception)_[_1_2_]
are subject to strict local conservation laws as well. In this case, energy can
only be exchanged between adjacent regions of space, and all observers agree as
to the volumetric density of energy in any given space. There is also a global
law of conservation of energy, stating that the total energy of the universe
cannot change; this is a corollary of the local law, but not vice versa._[_4_]_[_1_3_]
_C_o_n_s_e_r_v_a_t_i_o_n_ _o_f_ _e_n_e_r_g_y is the mathematical consequence of _t_r_a_n_s_l_a_t_i_o_n_a_l
_s_y_m_m_e_t_r_y of _t_i_m_e (that is, the indistinguishability of time intervals taken at
different time)_[_1_4_] - see _N_o_e_t_h_e_r_'_s_ _t_h_e_o_r_e_m.
According to _C_o_n_s_e_r_v_a_t_i_o_n_ _o_f_ _e_n_e_r_g_y the total inflow of energy into a system
must equal the total outflow of energy from the system, plus the change in the
energy contained within the system.
This law is a fundamental principle of physics. It follows from the
_t_r_a_n_s_l_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _s_y_m_m_e_t_r_y of _t_i_m_e, a property of most phenomena below the cosmic
scale that makes them independent of their locations on the time coordinate.
Put differently, yesterday, today, and tomorrow are physically
indistinguishable.
This is because energy is the quantity which is _c_a_n_o_n_i_c_a_l_ _c_o_n_j_u_g_a_t_e to time.
This mathematical entanglement of energy and time also results in the
uncertainty principle - it is impossible to define the exact amount of energy
during any definite time interval. The uncertainty principle should not be
confused with energy conservation - rather it provides mathematical limits to
which energy can in principle be defined and measured.
Each of the basic forces of nature is associated with a different type of
potential energy, and all types of potential energy (like all other types of
energy) appears as system _m_a_s_s, whenever present. For example, a compressed
spring will be slightly more massive than before it was compressed. Likewise,
whenever energy is transferred between systems by any mechanism, an associated
mass is transferred with it.
In _q_u_a_n_t_u_m_ _m_e_c_h_a_n_i_c_s energy is expressed using the Hamiltonian _o_p_e_r_a_t_o_r. On any
time scales, the uncertainty in the energy is by
      [\Delta E \Delta t \ge \frac { \hbar } {2 } ]
which is similar in form to the Heisenberg _u_n_c_e_r_t_a_i_n_t_y_ _p_r_i_n_c_i_p_l_e (but not
really mathematically equivalent thereto, since H and t are not dynamically
conjugate variables, neither in classical nor in quantum mechanics).
In _p_a_r_t_i_c_l_e_ _p_h_y_s_i_c_s, this inequality permits a qualitative understanding of
_v_i_r_t_u_a_l_ _p_a_r_t_i_c_l_e_s which carry _m_o_m_e_n_t_u_m, exchange by which and with real

Energy is subject to a strict _g_l_o_b_a_l_ _c_o_n_s_e_r_v_a_t_i_o_n_ _l_a_w; that is, whenever one
measures (or calculates) the total energy of a system of particles whose
interactions do not depend explicitly on time, it is found that the total
energy of the system always remains constant._[_1_5_]
    * The total energy of a _s_y_s_t_e_m can be subdivided and classified in various
      ways. For example, it is sometimes convenient to distinguish _p_o_t_e_n_t_i_a_l
      _e_n_e_r_g_y (which is a function of coordinates only) from _k_i_n_e_t_i_c_ _e_n_e_r_g_y
      (which is a function of coordinate time _d_e_r_i_v_a_t_i_v_e_s only). It may also be
      convenient to distinguish gravitational energy, electric energy, thermal
      energy, and other forms. These classifications overlap; for instance,
      thermal energy usually consists partly of kinetic and partly of potential
      energy.
    * The transfer of energy can take various forms; familiar examples include
      work, heat flow, and advection, as discussed _b_e_l_o_w.
    * The word "energy" is also used outside of physics in many ways, which can
      lead to ambiguity and inconsistency. The vernacular terminology is not
      consistent with _t_e_c_h_n_i_c_a_l_ _t_e_r_m_i_n_o_l_o_g_y. For example, while energy is
      always conserved (in the sense that the total energy does not change
      despite energy transformations), energy can be converted into a form,
      e.g., thermal energy, that cannot be utilized to perform work. When one
      talks about "conserving energy by driving less," one talks about
      conserving fossil fuels and preventing useful energy from being lost as
      heat. This usage of "conserve" differs from that of the law of
      conservation of energy._[_1_3_]
In _c_l_a_s_s_i_c_a_l_ _p_h_y_s_i_c_s energy is considered a scalar quantity, the _c_a_n_o_n_i_c_a_l
_c_o_n_j_u_g_a_t_e to _t_i_m_e. In _s_p_e_c_i_a_l_ _r_e_l_a_t_i_v_i_t_y energy is also a scalar (although not
a _L_o_r_e_n_t_z_ _s_c_a_l_a_r but a time component of the _e_n_e_r_g_y_-_m_o_m_e_n_t_u_m _4_-_v_e_c_t_o_r)._[_1_6_] In
other words, energy is invariant with respect to rotations of _s_p_a_c_e, but not
invariant with respect to rotations of _s_p_a_c_e_-_t_i_m_e (= _b_o_o_s_t_s).

A system can transfer energy to another system by simply transferring matter to
it (since matter is equivalent to energy, in accordance with its mass).
However, when energy is transferred by means other than matter-transfer, the
transfer produces changes in the second system, as a result of work done on it.
This work manifests itself as the effect of force(s) applied through distances
within the target system.
For example, a system can emit energy to another by transferring (radiating)
_e_l_e_c_t_r_o_m_a_g_n_e_t_i_c_ _e_n_e_r_g_y, but this creates forces upon the particles that absorb
the radiation. Similarly, a system may transfer energy to another by physically
impacting it, but in that case the energy of motion in an object, called
_k_i_n_e_t_i_c_ _e_n_e_r_g_y, results in forces acting over distances (new energy) to appear
in another object that is struck. Transfer of _t_h_e_r_m_a_l_ _e_n_e_r_g_y by _h_e_a_t occurs by
both of these mechanisms: heat can be transferred by electromagnetic radiation,
or by physical contact in which direct particle-particle impacts transfer
kinetic energy.
Because energy is strictly conserved and is also locally conserved (wherever it
can be defined), it is important to remember that by the definition of energy
the transfer of energy between the "system" and adjacent regions is work. A
familiar example is _m_e_c_h_a_n_i_c_a_l_ _w_o_r_k. In simple cases this is written as the
following equation:
      [\Delta{}E = W]       ((_11
                            ))
if there are no other energy-transfer processes involved. Here [E] is the
amount of energy transferred, and [W]  represents the work done on the system.
[_d_u_b_i_o_u_s ‚Äì _d_i_s_c_u_s_s]
More generally, the energy transfer can be split into two categories:
      [\Delta{}E = W + Q ]       ((_22
                                 ))
where [Q] represents the heat flow into the system.
There are other ways in which an open system can gain or lose energy. In
chemical systems, energy can be added to a system by means of adding substances
with different chemical potentials, which potentials are then extracted (both
of these process are illustrated by fueling an auto, a system which gains in
energy thereby, without addition of either work or heat). Winding a clock would
be adding energy to a mechanical system. These terms may be added to the above
equation, or they can generally be subsumed into a quantity called "energy
addition term [E]" which refers to any type of energy carried over the surface
of a control volume or system volume. Examples may be seen above, and many
others can be imagined (for example, the kinetic energy of a stream of
particles entering a system, or energy from a laser beam adds to system energy,
without either being either work-done or heat-added, in the classic senses).
      [\Delta{}E = W + Q + E ]       ((_33
                                     ))
Where E in this general equation represents other additional advected energy
terms not covered by work done on a system, or heat added to it.
Energy is also transferred from potential energy ([E_p]) to kinetic energy (
[E_k]) and then back to potential energy constantly. This is referred to as
conservation of energy. In this closed system, energy cannot be created or
destroyed; therefore, the initial energy and the final energy will be equal to
each other. This can be demonstrated by the following:
      [E_{pi} + E_{ki} = E_{pF} + E_{kF}]       ((_44
                                                ))
The equation can then be simplified further since [E_p = mgh] (mass times
acceleration due to gravity times the height) and [E_k = \frac{1}{2} mv^2]
(half mass times velocity squared). Then the total amount of energy can be
found by adding [E_p + E_k = E_{total}].

property, as it is a _c_o_n_s_e_r_v_e_d_ _q_u_a_n_t_i_t_y. Several formulations of mechanics have

The total energy of a system is sometimes called the _H_a_m_i_l_t_o_n_i_a_n, after _W_i_l_l_i_a_m
_R_o_w_a_n_ _H_a_m_i_l_t_o_n. The classical equations of motion can be written in terms of
the Hamiltonian, even for highly complex or abstract systems. These classical
equations have remarkably direct analogs in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics.

Another energy-related concept is called the _L_a_g_r_a_n_g_i_a_n, after _J_o_s_e_p_h_ _L_o_u_i_s
_L_a_g_r_a_n_g_e. This is even more fundamental than the Hamiltonian, and can be used
to derive the equations of motion. It was invented in the context of _c_l_a_s_s_i_c_a_l
_m_e_c_h_a_n_i_c_s, but is generally useful in modern physics. The Lagrangian is defined
as the kinetic energy minus the potential energy.
Usually, the Lagrange formalism is mathematically more convenient than the
Hamiltonian for non-conservative systems (such as systems with friction).

not have a corresponding conservation law.

_I_n_t_e_r_n_a_l_ _e_n_e_r_g_y is the sum of all microscopic forms of energy of a system. It

aspects, as well as the motion of the particles, in form of kinetic energy.
Thermodynamics is chiefly concerned with changes in internal energy and not its
absolute value, which is impossible to determine with thermodynamics alone._[_1_8_]

of energy transfer. For homogeneous systems, with a well-defined temperature
and pressure, a commonly used corollary of the first law is that, for a system
subject only to _p_r_e_s_s_u_r_e forces and heat transfer (e.g., a cylinder-full of
gas), the differential change in the internal energy of the system (with a gain
in energy signified by a positive quantity) is given as
      [\mathrm{d}E = T\mathrm{d}S - P\mathrm{d}V\,],
where the first term on the right is the heat transferred into the system,
expressed in terms of _t_e_m_p_e_r_a_t_u_r_e T and _e_n_t_r_o_p_y S (in which entropy increases
and the change dS is positive when the system is heated), and the last term on
the right hand side is identified as work done on the system, where pressure is
P and volume V (the negative sign results since compression of the system
requires work to be done on it and so the volume change, dV, is negative when
work is done on the system).
This equation is highly specific, ignoring all chemical, electrical, nuclear,
and gravitational forces, effects such as _a_d_v_e_c_t_i_o_n of any form of energy other
than heat and pV-work. The general formulation of the first law (i.e.,
conservation of energy) is valid even in situations in which the system is not
homogeneous. For these cases the change in internal energy of a closed system
is expressed in a general form by
      [\mathrm{d}E=\delta Q+\delta W]

The energy of a mechanical _h_a_r_m_o_n_i_c_ _o_s_c_i_l_l_a_t_o_r (a mass on a spring) is
alternatively _k_i_n_e_t_i_c and _p_o_t_e_n_t_i_a_l. At two points in the oscillation _c_y_c_l_e it
is entirely kinetic, and alternatively at two other points it is entirely
potential. Over the whole cycle, or over many cycles, net energy is thus
equally split between kinetic and potential. This is called _e_q_u_i_p_a_r_t_i_t_i_o_n
_p_r_i_n_c_i_p_l_e; total energy of a system with many degrees of freedom is equally
split among all available degrees of freedom.
This principle is vitally important to understanding the behavior of a quantity
closely related to energy, called _e_n_t_r_o_p_y. Entropy is a measure of evenness of
a _d_i_s_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_o_n of energy between parts of a system. When an isolated system is
given more degrees of freedom (i.e., given new available _e_n_e_r_g_y_ _s_t_a_t_e_s that are
the same as existing states), then total energy spreads over all available
degrees equally without distinction between "new" and "old" degrees. This
mathematical result is called the _s_e_c_o_n_d_ _l_a_w_ _o_f_ _t_h_e_r_m_o_d_y_n_a_m_i_c_s.

In an ensemble (connected collection) of unsynchronized _o_s_c_i_l_l_a_t_o_r_s, the
average energy is spread equally between kinetic and potential types.
In a solid, _t_h_e_r_m_a_l_ _e_n_e_r_g_y (often referred to loosely as heat content) can be
accurately described by an ensemble of thermal _p_h_o_n_o_n_s that act as mechanical
oscillators. In this model, thermal energy is equally kinetic and potential.
In an _i_d_e_a_l_ _g_a_s, the interaction potential between particles is essentially the
_d_e_l_t_a_ _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n which stores no energy: thus, all of the thermal energy is
kinetic.
Because an electric oscillator (_L_C_ _c_i_r_c_u_i_t) is analogous to a mechanical
oscillator, its energy must be, on average, equally kinetic and potential. It
is entirely arbitrary whether the magnetic energy is considered kinetic and
whether the electric energy is considered potential, or vice versa. That is,
either the _i_n_d_u_c_t_o_r is analogous to the mass while the _c_a_p_a_c_i_t_o_r is analogous
to the spring, or vice versa.
1. By extension of the previous line of thought, in _f_r_e_e_ _s_p_a_c_e the
electromagnetic field can be considered an ensemble of oscillators, meaning
that _r_a_d_i_a_t_i_o_n_ _e_n_e_r_g_y can be considered equally potential and kinetic. This
model is useful, for example, when the electromagnetic _L_a_g_r_a_n_g_i_a_n is of primary
interest and is interpreted in terms of potential and kinetic energy.
2. On the other hand, in the key equation [m^2 c^4 = E^2 - p^2 c^2], the
contribution [mc^2] is called the rest energy, and all other contributions to
the energy are called kinetic energy. For a particle that has mass, this
implies that the kinetic energy is [0.5 p^2/m] at speeds much smaller than c,
as can be proved by writing [E = mc^2 ] ‚àö[(1 + p^2 m^{-2}c^{-2})] and
expanding the square root to lowest order. By this line of reasoning, the
energy of a photon is entirely kinetic, because the photon is massless and has
no rest energy. This expression is useful, for example, when the energy-versus-
momentum relationship is of primary interest.
The two analyses are entirely consistent. The electric and magnetic degrees of
freedom in item 1 are transverse to the direction of motion, while the speed in
item 2 is along the direction of motion. For non-relativistic particles these
two notions of potential versus kinetic energy are numerically equal, so the
ambiguity is harmless, but not so for relativistic particles.

In quantum mechanics energy is defined in terms of the _e_n_e_r_g_y_ _o_p_e_r_a_t_o_r as a
time derivative of the _w_a_v_e_ _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n. The _S_c_h_r_√_∂_d_i_n_g_e_r_ _e_q_u_a_t_i_o_n equates the
energy operator to the full energy of a particle or a system. In results can be
considered as a definition of measurement of energy in quantum mechanics. The
Schr√∂dinger equation describes the space- and time-dependence of slow changing
(non-relativistic) _w_a_v_e_ _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n of quantum systems. The solution of this
equation for bound system is discrete (a set of permitted states, each
characterized by an _e_n_e_r_g_y_ _l_e_v_e_l) which results in the concept of _q_u_a_n_t_a. In
the solution of the Schr√∂dinger equation for any oscillator (vibrator) and for
electromagnetic waves in a vacuum, the resulting energy states are related to
the frequency by the _P_l_a_n_c_k equation [E = h\nu] (where [h] is the _P_l_a_n_c_k_'_s
_c_o_n_s_t_a_n_t and [\nu] the frequency). In the case of electromagnetic wave these
energy states are called quanta of _l_i_g_h_t or _p_h_o_t_o_n_s.

When calculating kinetic energy (_w_o_r_k to accelerate a _m_a_s_s from zero _s_p_e_e_d to
some finite speed) relativistically - using _L_o_r_e_n_t_z_ _t_r_a_n_s_f_o_r_m_a_t_i_o_n_s instead of
_N_e_w_t_o_n_i_a_n_ _m_e_c_h_a_n_i_c_s, Einstein discovered an unexpected by-product of these
calculations to be an energy term which does not vanish at zero speed. He
called it _r_e_s_t_ _m_a_s_s_ _e_n_e_r_g_y - energy which every mass must possess even when
being at rest. The amount of energy is directly proportional to the mass of
body:
      [ E = m c^2 ],
where
      m is the mass,
      c is the _s_p_e_e_d_ _o_f_ _l_i_g_h_t in vacuum,
      E is the rest mass energy.
For example, consider _e_l_e_c_t_r_o_n-_p_o_s_i_t_r_o_n annihilation, in which the rest mass of
individual particles is destroyed, but the inertia equivalent of the system of
the two particles (its _i_n_v_a_r_i_a_n_t_ _m_a_s_s) remains (since all energy is associated
with mass), and this inertia and invariant mass is carried off by photons which
individually are massless, but as a system retain their mass. This is a
reversible process - the inverse process is called _p_a_i_r_ _c_r_e_a_t_i_o_n - in which the
rest mass of particles is created from energy of two (or more) annihilating
photons. In this system the _m_a_t_t_e_r (electrons and positrons) is destroyed and
changed to non-matter energy (the photons). However, the total system mass and
energy do not change during this interaction.
In general relativity, the _s_t_r_e_s_s_-_e_n_e_r_g_y_ _t_e_n_s_o_r serves as the source term for
the gravitational field, in rough analogy to the way mass serves as the source
term in the non-relativistic Newtonian approximation._[_1_6_]
It is not uncommon to hear that energy is "equivalent" to mass. It would be
more accurate to state that every energy has an inertia and gravity equivalent,
and because mass is a form of energy, then mass too has inertia and gravity
associated with it.

Because energy is defined as the ability to do work on objects, there is no
absolute measure of energy. Only the transition of a system from one state into
another can be defined and thus energy is measured in relative terms. The
choice of a baseline or zero point is often arbitrary and can be made in
whatever way is most convenient for a problem. For example in the case of
measuring the energy deposited by X-rays as shown in the accompanying diagram,
conventionally the technique most often employed is _c_a_l_o_r_i_m_e_t_r_y. This is a
_t_h_e_r_m_o_d_y_n_a_m_i_c technique that relies on the measurement of temperature using a
