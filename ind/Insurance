This article is about risk management. For Insurance (blackjack), see
_B_l_a_c_k_j_a_c_k. For the contract between insurer and insured, see _I_n_s_u_r_a_n_c_e_ _p_o_l_i_c_y.
IInnssuurraannccee is the equitable transfer of the risk of a loss, from one entity to
another in exchange for payment. It is a form of _r_i_s_k_ _m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t primarily used
to _h_e_d_g_e against the risk of a contingent, uncertain loss.
An insurer, or insurance carrier, is a company selling the insurance; the
insured, or policyholder, is the person or entity buying the insurance policy.
The amount of _m_o_n_e_y to be charged for a certain amount of insurance coverage is
called the premium. _R_i_s_k_ _m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t, the practice of _a_p_p_r_a_i_s_i_n_g and controlling
risk, has evolved as a discrete field of study and practice.
The transaction involves the insured assuming a guaranteed and known relatively
small loss in the form of payment to the insurer in exchange for the insurer's
promise to compensate (_i_n_d_e_m_n_i_f_y) the insured in the case of a financial
(personal) loss. The insured receives a _c_o_n_t_r_a_c_t, called the _i_n_s_u_r_a_n_c_e_ _p_o_l_i_c_y,
which details the conditions and circumstances under which the insured will be
financially compensated.

Insurance involves _p_o_o_l_i_n_g funds from many insured entities (known as
exposures) to pay for the losses that some may incur. The insured entities are
therefore protected from risk for a fee, with the fee being dependent upon the
frequency and severity of the event occurring. In order to be an _i_n_s_u_r_a_b_l_e
_r_i_s_k, the risk insured against must meet certain characteristics. Insurance as
a financial intermediary is a commercial enterprise and a major part of the
financial services industry, but individual entities can also _s_e_l_f_-_i_n_s_u_r_e
through saving money for possible future losses._[_1_]

Risk which can be insured by private companies typically shares seven common
characteristics:_[_2_]
   1. LLaarrggee nnuummbbeerr ooff ssiimmiillaarr eexxppoossuurree uunniittss: Since insurance operates through
      pooling resources, the majority of insurance policies are provided for
      individual members of large classes, allowing insurers to benefit from
      the _l_a_w_ _o_f_ _l_a_r_g_e_ _n_u_m_b_e_r_s in which predicted losses are similar to the
      actual losses. Exceptions include _L_l_o_y_d_'_s_ _o_f_ _L_o_n_d_o_n, which is famous for
      insuring the life or health of actors, sports figures, and other famous
      individuals. However, all exposures will have particular differences,
      which may lead to different premium rates.
   2. DDeeffiinniittee lloossss: The loss takes place at a known time, in a known place,
      and from a known cause. The classic example is death of an insured person
      on a life insurance policy. _F_i_r_e, _a_u_t_o_m_o_b_i_l_e_ _a_c_c_i_d_e_n_t_s, and worker
      injuries may all easily meet this criterion. Other types of losses may
      only be definite in theory. _O_c_c_u_p_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _d_i_s_e_a_s_e, for instance, may
      involve prolonged exposure to injurious conditions where no specific
      time, place, or cause is identifiable. Ideally, the time, place, and
      cause of a loss should be clear enough that a reasonable person, with
      sufficient information, could objectively verify all three elements.
   3. AAcccciiddeennttaall lloossss: The event that constitutes the trigger of a claim should
      be fortuitous, or at least outside the control of the beneficiary of the
      insurance. The loss should be pure, in the sense that it results from an
      event for which there is only the opportunity for cost. Events that
      contain speculative elements, such as ordinary business risks or even
      purchasing a lottery ticket, are generally not considered insurable.
   4. LLaarrggee lloossss: The size of the loss must be meaningful from the perspective
      of the insured. Insurance premiums need to cover both the expected cost
      of losses, plus the cost of issuing and administering the policy,
      adjusting losses, and supplying the capital needed to reasonably assure
      that the insurer will be able to pay claims. For small losses, these
      latter costs may be several times the size of the expected cost of
      losses. There is hardly any point in paying such costs unless the
      protection offered has real value to a buyer.
   5. AAffffoorrddaabbllee pprreemmiiuumm: If the likelihood of an insured event is so high, or
      the cost of the event so large, that the resulting premium is large
      relative to the amount of protection offered, then it is not likely that
      the insurance will be purchased, even if on offer. Furthermore, as the
      accounting profession formally recognizes in financial accounting
      standards, the premium cannot be so large that there is not a reasonable
      chance of a significant loss to the insurer. If there is no such chance
      of loss, then the transaction may have the form of insurance, but not the
      substance. (See the US _F_i_n_a_n_c_i_a_l_ _A_c_c_o_u_n_t_i_n_g_ _S_t_a_n_d_a_r_d_s_ _B_o_a_r_d _s_t_a_n_d_a_r_d
      _n_u_m_b_e_r_ _1_1_3)
   6. CCaallccuullaabbllee lloossss: There are two elements that must be at least estimable,
      if not formally calculable: the probability of loss, and the attendant
      cost. Probability of loss is generally an empirical exercise, while cost
      has more to do with the ability of a reasonable person in possession of a
      copy of the insurance policy and a proof of loss associated with a claim
      presented under that policy to make a reasonably definite and objective
      evaluation of the amount of the loss recoverable as a result of the
      claim.
   7. LLiimmiitteedd rriisskk ooff ccaattaassttrroopphhiiccaallllyy llaarrggee lloosssseess: Insurable losses are
      ideally _i_n_d_e_p_e_n_d_e_n_t and non-catastrophic, meaning that the losses do not
      happen all at once and individual losses are not severe enough to
      bankrupt the insurer; insurers may prefer to limit their exposure to a
      loss from a single event to some small portion of their capital base.
      _C_a_p_i_t_a_l constrains insurers' ability to sell _e_a_r_t_h_q_u_a_k_e_ _i_n_s_u_r_a_n_c_e as well
      as wind insurance in _h_u_r_r_i_c_a_n_e zones. In the US, _f_l_o_o_d_ _r_i_s_k is insured by
      the federal government. In commercial fire insurance, it is possible to
      find single properties whose total exposed value is well in excess of any
      individual insurer's capital constraint. Such properties are generally
      shared among several insurers, or are insured by a single insurer who
      syndicates the risk into the _r_e_i_n_s_u_r_a_n_c_e market.

When a company insures an individual entity, there are basic legal
requirements. Several commonly cited legal principles of insurance include:_[_3_]
   1. _I_n_d_e_m_n_i_t_y â the insurance company indemnifies, or compensates, the
      insured in the case of certain losses only up to the insured's interest.
   2. _I_n_s_u_r_a_b_l_e_ _i_n_t_e_r_e_s_t â the insured typically must directly suffer from
      the loss. Insurable interest must exist whether property insurance or
      insurance on a person is involved. The concept requires that the insured
      have a "stake" in the loss or damage to the life or property insured.
      What that "stake" is will be determined by the kind of insurance involved
      and the nature of the property ownership or relationship between the
      persons. The requirement of an insurable interest is what distinguishes
      insurance from _g_a_m_b_l_i_n_g.
   3. _U_t_m_o_s_t_ _g_o_o_d_ _f_a_i_t_h â (_U_b_e_r_r_i_m_a_ _f_i_d_e_s) the insured and the insurer are
      bound by a _g_o_o_d_ _f_a_i_t_h bond of honesty and fairness. Material facts must
      be disclosed.
   4. Contribution â insurers which have similar obligations to the insured
      contribute in the indemnification, according to some method.
   5. Subrogation â the insurance company acquires legal rights to pursue
      recoveries on behalf of the insured; for example, the insurer may sue
      those liable for the insured's loss.
   6. Causa proxima, or _p_r_o_x_i_m_a_t_e_ _c_a_u_s_e â the cause of loss (the peril) must
      be covered under the insuring agreement of the policy, and the dominant
      cause must not be _e_x_c_l_u_d_e_d
   7. Mitigation â In case of any loss or casualty, the asset owner must
      attempt to keep loss to a minimum, as if the asset was not insured.

To "indemnify" means to make whole again, or to be reinstated to the position
that one was in, to the extent possible, prior to the happening of a specified
event or peril. Accordingly, _l_i_f_e_ _i_n_s_u_r_a_n_c_e is generally not considered to be
indemnity insurance, but rather "contingent" insurance (i.e., a claim arises on
the occurrence of a specified event). There are generally three types of
insurance contracts that seek to indemnify an insured:
   1. a "reimbursement" policy, and
   2. a "pay on behalf" or "on behalf of"_[_4_] policy, and
   3. an "indemnification" policy.
From an insured's standpoint, the result is usually the same: the insurer pays
the loss and claims expenses.
If the Insured has a "reimbursement" policy, the insured can be required to pay
for a loss and then be "reimbursed" by the insurance carrier for the loss and
out of pocket costs including, with the permission of the insurer, claim
expenses._[_4_]_[_5_]
Under a "pay on behalf" policy, the insurance carrier would defend and pay a
claim on behalf of the insured who would not be out of pocket for anything.
Most modern liability insurance is written on the basis of "pay on behalf"
language which enables the insurance carrier to manage and control the claim.
Under an "indemnification" policy, the insurance carrier can generally either
"reimburse" or "pay on behalf of", whichever is more beneficial to it and the
insured in the claim handling process.
An entity seeking to transfer risk (an individual, corporation, or association
of any type, etc.) becomes the 'insured' party once risk is assumed by an
'insurer', the insuring party, by means of a _c_o_n_t_r_a_c_t, called an _i_n_s_u_r_a_n_c_e
_p_o_l_i_c_y. Generally, an insurance contract includes, at a minimum, the following
elements: identification of participating parties (the insurer, the insured,
the beneficiaries), the premium, the period of coverage, the particular loss
event covered, the amount of coverage (i.e., the amount to be paid to the
insured or beneficiary in the event of a loss), and _e_x_c_l_u_s_i_o_n_s (events not
covered). An insured is thus said to be "_i_n_d_e_m_n_i_f_i_e_d" against the loss covered
in the policy.
When insured parties experience a loss for a specified peril, the coverage
entitles the policyholder to make a claim against the insurer for the covered
amount of loss as specified by the policy. The fee paid by the insured to the
insurer for assuming the risk is called the premium. Insurance premiums from
many insureds are used to fund accounts reserved for later payment of claims
â in theory for a relatively few claimants â and for _o_v_e_r_h_e_a_d costs. So
long as an insurer maintains adequate funds set aside for anticipated losses
(called reserves), the remaining margin is an insurer's _p_r_o_f_i_t.

Insurance can have various effects on society through the way that it changes
who bears the cost of losses and damage. On one hand it can increase fraud; on
the other it can help societies and individuals prepare for catastrophes and
mitigate the effects of catastrophes on both households and societies.
Insurance can influence the probability of losses through _m_o_r_a_l_ _h_a_z_a_r_d,
_i_n_s_u_r_a_n_c_e_ _f_r_a_u_d, and preventive steps by the insurance company. Insurance
scholars have typically used _m_o_r_a_l_e_ _h_a_z_a_r_d to refer to the increased loss due
to unintentional carelessness and moral hazard to refer to increased risk due
to intentional carelessness or indifference._[_6_] Insurers attempt to address
carelessness through inspections, policy provisions requiring certain types of
maintenance, and possible discounts for loss mitigation efforts. While in
theory insurers could encourage investment in loss reduction, some commentators
have argued that in practice insurers had historically not aggressively pursued
loss control measures â particularly to prevent disaster losses such as
hurricanesâbecause of concerns over rate reductions and legal battles.
However, since about 1996 insurers have begun to take a more active role in
loss mitigation, such as through _b_u_i_l_d_i_n_g_ _c_o_d_e_s._[_7_]

The business model is to collect more in premium and investment income than is
paid out in losses, and to also offer a competitive price which consumers will
accept. Profit can be reduced to a simple equation:
      Profit = _e_a_r_n_e_d_ _p_r_e_m_i_u_m + investment income - incurred loss -
      underwriting expenses.
Insurers make money in two ways:
    * Through _u_n_d_e_r_w_r_i_t_i_n_g, the process by which insurers select the risks to
      insure and decide how much in premiums to charge for accepting those
      risks
    * By _i_n_v_e_s_t_i_n_g the premiums they collect from insured parties
The most complicated aspect of the insurance business is the _a_c_t_u_a_r_i_a_l_ _s_c_i_e_n_c_e
of ratemaking (price-setting) of policies, which uses _s_t_a_t_i_s_t_i_c_s and
_p_r_o_b_a_b_i_l_i_t_y to approximate the rate of future claims based on a given risk.
After producing rates, the insurer will use discretion to reject or accept
risks through the underwriting process.
At the most basic level, initial ratemaking involves looking at the _f_r_e_q_u_e_n_c_y
and _s_e_v_e_r_i_t_y of insured perils and the expected average payout resulting from
these perils. Thereafter an insurance company will collect historical loss
data, bring the loss data to _p_r_e_s_e_n_t_ _v_a_l_u_e, and compare these prior losses to
the premium collected in order to assess rate adequacy._[_8_] _L_o_s_s_ _r_a_t_i_o_s and
expense loads are also used. Rating for different risk characteristics involves
at the most basic level comparing the losses with "loss relativities"âa
policy with twice as many losses would therefore be charged twice as much. More
complex _m_u_l_t_i_v_a_r_i_a_t_e_ _a_n_a_l_y_s_e_s are sometimes used when multiple characteristics
are involved and a univariate analysis could produce confounded results. Other
statistical methods may be used in assessing the probability of future losses.
Upon termination of a given policy, the amount of premium collected minus the
amount paid out in claims is the insurer's _u_n_d_e_r_w_r_i_t_i_n_g_ _p_r_o_f_i_t on that policy.
Underwriting performance is measured by something called the "combined ratio"
_[_9_] which is the ratio of expenses/losses to premiums. A combined ratio of less
than 100 percent indicates an underwriting profit, while anything over 100
indicates an underwriting loss. A company with a combined ratio over 100% may
nevertheless remain profitable due to investment earnings.
Insurance companies earn _i_n_v_e_s_t_m_e_n_t profits on "float". Float, or available
reserve, is the amount of money on hand at any given moment that an insurer has
collected in insurance premiums but has not paid out in claims. Insurers start
investing insurance premiums as soon as they are collected and continue to earn
interest or other income on them until claims are paid out. The _A_s_s_o_c_i_a_t_i_o_n_ _o_f
_B_r_i_t_i_s_h_ _I_n_s_u_r_e_r_s (gathering 400 insurance companies and 94% of UK insurance
services) has almost 20% of the investments in the _L_o_n_d_o_n_ _S_t_o_c_k_ _E_x_c_h_a_n_g_e._[_1_0_]
In the _U_n_i_t_e_d_ _S_t_a_t_e_s, the underwriting loss of _p_r_o_p_e_r_t_y and _c_a_s_u_a_l_t_y_ _i_n_s_u_r_a_n_c_e
companies was $142.3 billion in the five years ending 2003. But overall profit
for the same period was $68.4 billion, as the result of float. Some insurance
industry insiders, most notably _H_a_n_k_ _G_r_e_e_n_b_e_r_g, do not believe that it is
forever possible to sustain a profit from float without an underwriting profit
as well, but this opinion is not universally held.
Naturally, the float method is difficult to carry out in an _e_c_o_n_o_m_i_c_a_l_l_y
_d_e_p_r_e_s_s_e_d period. _B_e_a_r_ _m_a_r_k_e_t_s do cause insurers to shift away from investments
and to toughen up their underwriting standards, so a poor economy generally
means high insurance premiums. This tendency to swing between profitable and
unprofitable periods over time is commonly known as the _u_n_d_e_r_w_r_i_t_i_n_g_,_ _o_r

Claims and loss handling is the materialized utility of insurance; it is the
actual "product" paid for. Claims may be filed by insureds directly with the
insurer or through _b_r_o_k_e_r_s_ _o_r_ _a_g_e_n_t_s. The insurer may require that the claim be
filed on its own proprietary forms, or may accept claims on a standard industry
form, such as those produced by _A_C_O_R_D.
Insurance company claims departments employ a large number of _c_l_a_i_m_s_ _a_d_j_u_s_t_e_r_s
supported by a staff of _r_e_c_o_r_d_s_ _m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t and _d_a_t_a_ _e_n_t_r_y_ _c_l_e_r_k_s. Incoming
claims are classified based on severity and are assigned to adjusters whose
settlement authority varies with their knowledge and experience. The adjuster
undertakes an investigation of each claim, usually in close cooperation with
the insured, determines if coverage is available under the terms of the
insurance contract, and if so, the reasonable monetary value of the claim, and
authorizes payment.
The policyholder may hire their own _p_u_b_l_i_c_ _a_d_j_u_s_t_e_r to negotiate the settlement
with the insurance company on their behalf. For policies that are complicated,
where claims may be complex, the insured may take out a separate insurance
policy add on, called loss recovery insurance, which covers the cost of a
public adjuster in the case of a claim.
Adjusting liability insurance claims is particularly difficult because there is
a third party involved, the _p_l_a_i_n_t_i_f_f, who is under no contractual obligation
to cooperate with the insurer and may in fact regard the insurer as a _d_e_e_p
_p_o_c_k_e_t. The adjuster must obtain legal counsel for the insured (either inside
"house" counsel or outside "panel" counsel), monitor litigation that may take
years to complete, and appear in person or over the telephone with settlement
authority at a mandatory settlement conference when requested by the judge.
If a claims adjuster suspects under-insurance, the _c_o_n_d_i_t_i_o_n_ _o_f_ _a_v_e_r_a_g_e may
come into play to limit the insurance company's exposure.
In managing the claims handling function, insurers seek to balance the elements
of customer satisfaction, administrative handling expenses, and claims
overpayment leakages. As part of this balancing act, _f_r_a_u_d_u_l_e_n_t_ _i_n_s_u_r_a_n_c_e
_p_r_a_c_t_i_c_e_s are a major business risk that must be managed and overcome. Disputes
between insurers and insureds over the validity of claims or claims handling
practices occasionally escalate into litigation (see _i_n_s_u_r_a_n_c_e_ _b_a_d_ _f_a_i_t_h).

Insurers will often use _i_n_s_u_r_a_n_c_e_ _a_g_e_n_t_s to initially market or underwrite

In some sense we can say that insurance appears simultaneously with the
appearance of human society. We know of two types of economies in human
societies: natural or non-monetary economies (using barter and trade with no
centralized nor standardized set of financial instruments) and more modern
monetary economies (with markets, currency, financial instruments and so on).
The former is more primitive and the insurance in such economies entails
agreements of mutual aid. If one family's house is destroyed the neighbours are
committed to help rebuild. Granaries housed another primitive form of insurance
to indemnify against famines. Often informal or formally intrinsic to local
religious customs, this type of insurance has survived to the present day in
some countries where a modern money economy with its financial instruments is
not widespread.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]
Turning to insurance in the modern sense (i.e., insurance in a modern money
economy, in which insurance is part of the financial sphere), early methods of
transferring or distributing risk were practiced by _C_h_i_n_e_s_e and _B_a_b_y_l_o_n_i_a_n
traders as long ago as the _3_r_d and _2_n_d _m_i_l_l_e_n_n_i_a BC, respectively._[_1_3_] Chinese
merchants travelling treacherous river rapids would redistribute their wares
across many vessels to limit the loss due to any single vessel's capsizing. The
Babylonians developed a system which was recorded in the famous _C_o_d_e_ _o_f
_H_a_m_m_u_r_a_b_i, c. 1750 BC, and practiced by early _M_e_d_i_t_e_r_r_a_n_e_a_n sailing _m_e_r_c_h_a_n_t_s.
If a merchant received a loan to fund his shipment, he would pay the lender an
additional sum in exchange for the lender's guarantee to cancel the loan should
the shipment be stolen or lost at sea.
_A_c_h_a_e_m_e_n_i_a_n monarchs of Ancient Persia were the first to insure their people
and made it official by registering the insuring process in governmental notary
offices. The insurance tradition was performed each year in Norouz (beginning
of the Iranian New Year); the heads of different ethnic groups as well as
others willing to take part, presented gifts to the monarch. The most important
gift was presented during a special ceremony. When a gift was worth more than
10,000 Derrik (Achaemenian gold coin) the issue was registered in a special
office. This was advantageous to those who presented such special gifts. For
others, the presents were fairly assessed by the confidants of the court. Then
the assessment was registered in special offices.
The subscription room at Lloyd's of London in the early 19th century.
The purpose of registering was that whenever the person who presented the gift
registered by the court was in trouble, the monarch and the court would help
him. Jahez, a historian and writer, writes in one of his books on _a_n_c_i_e_n_t_ _I_r_a_n:
"[W]henever the owner of the present is in trouble or wants to construct a
building, set up a feast, have his children married, etc. the one in charge of
this in the court would check the registration. If the registered amount
exceeded 10,000 Derrik, he or she would receive an amount of twice as much."
_[_1_4_]
A thousand years later, the inhabitants of _R_h_o_d_e_s invented the concept of the
_g_e_n_e_r_a_l_ _a_v_e_r_a_g_e. Merchants whose goods were being shipped together would pay a
proportionally divided premium which would be used to reimburse any merchant
whose goods were deliberately jettisoned in order to lighten the ship and save
it from _t_o_t_a_l_ _l_o_s_s.
The _a_n_c_i_e_n_t_ _A_t_h_e_n_i_a_n "maritime loan" advanced money for voyages with repayment
being cancelled if the ship was lost. In the 4th century BC, rates for the
loans differed according to safe or dangerous times of year, implying an
intuitive pricing of risk with an effect similar to insurance._[_1_5_] The _G_r_e_e_k_s
and _R_o_m_a_n_s introduced the origins of health and life insurance c. 600 BCE when
they created guilds called "benevolent societies" which cared for the _f_a_m_i_l_i_e_s
of deceased members, as well as paying _f_u_n_e_r_a_l expenses of members. _G_u_i_l_d_s in
the _M_i_d_d_l_e_ _A_g_e_s served a similar purpose. The _T_a_l_m_u_d deals with several aspects
of insuring _g_o_o_d_s. Before insurance was established in the late 17th century,
"friendly societies" existed in England, in which people donated amounts of
money to a general sum that could be used for emergencies.
Separate insurance contracts (i.e., insurance policies not bundled with loans
or other kinds of contracts) were invented in _G_e_n_o_a in the 14th century, as
were insurance pools backed by pledges of landed estates. These new insurance
contracts allowed insurance to be separated from investment, a separation of
roles that first proved useful in _m_a_r_i_n_e_ _i_n_s_u_r_a_n_c_e. Insurance became far more
sophisticated in post-_R_e_n_a_i_s_s_a_n_c_e _E_u_r_o_p_e, and specialized varieties developed.
_L_l_o_y_d_'_s_ _o_f_ _L_o_n_d_o_n, pictured in 1991, is one of the world's leading and most
famous insurance markets
Some forms of insurance had developed in _L_o_n_d_o_n by the early decades of the
17th century. For example, the will of the English colonist _R_o_b_e_r_t_ _H_a_y_m_a_n
mentions two "policies of insurance" taken out with the diocesan Chancellor of
London, Arthur Duck. Of the value of Â£100 each, one relates to the safe
arrival of Hayman's ship in Guyana and the other is in regard to "one hundred
pounds assured by the said Doctor Arthur Ducke on my life". Hayman's will was
signed and sealed on 17 November 1628 but not proved until 1633._[_1_6_] Toward the
end of the seventeenth century, London's growing importance as a centre for
trade increased demand for marine insurance. In the late 1680s, Edward Lloyd
opened _a_ _c_o_f_f_e_e_ _h_o_u_s_e that became a popular haunt of ship owners, merchants,
and ships' captains, and thereby a reliable source of the latest shipping news.
It became the meeting place for parties wishing to insure cargoes and ships,
and those willing to underwrite such ventures. Today, _L_l_o_y_d_'_s_ _o_f_ _L_o_n_d_o_n remains
the leading market (note that it is an insurance market rather than a company)
for marine and other specialist types of insurance, but it operates rather
differently than the more familiar kinds of insurance. Insurance as we know it
today can be traced to the _G_r_e_a_t_ _F_i_r_e_ _o_f_ _L_o_n_d_o_n, which in 1666 devoured more
than 13,000 houses. The devastating effects of the fire converted the
development of insurance "from a matter of convenience into one of urgency, a
change of opinion reflected in Sir Christopher Wren's inclusion of a site for
'the Insurance Office' in his new plan for London in 1667"._[_1_7_] A number of
attempted fire insurance schemes came to nothing, but in 1681 _N_i_c_h_o_l_a_s_ _B_a_r_b_o_n,
and eleven associates, established England's first fire insurance company, the
"Insurance Office for Houses", at the back of the Royal Exchange. Initially,
5,000 homes were insured by Barbon's Insurance Office._[_1_8_]
The first insurance company in the _U_n_i_t_e_d_ _S_t_a_t_e_s underwrote fire insurance and
was formed in Charles Town (modern-day _C_h_a_r_l_e_s_t_o_n), _S_o_u_t_h_ _C_a_r_o_l_i_n_a, in 1732.
_B_e_n_j_a_m_i_n_ _F_r_a_n_k_l_i_n helped to popularize and make standard the practice of

great, such as all wooden houses.
In the United States, _r_e_g_u_l_a_t_i_o_n of the insurance industry primary resides with
individual _s_t_a_t_e insurance departments. The current state insurance regulatory
framework has its roots in the 19th century, when _N_e_w_ _H_a_m_p_s_h_i_r_e appointed the
first insurance commissioner in 1851._[_1_9_] Congress adopted the McCarran-
Ferguson Act in 1945, which declared that states should regulate the business
of insurance and to affirm that the continued regulation of the insurance
industry by the states is in the public's best interest._[_1_9_] The Financial
Modernization Act of 1999, commonly referred to as "_G_r_a_m_m_-_L_e_a_c_h_-_B_l_i_l_e_y",
established a comprehensive framework to authorize affiliations between banks,
securities firms, and insurers, and once again acknowledged that states should
regulate insurance._[_1_9_]
Whereas insurance markets have become centralized nationally and
internationally, state insurance commissioners operate individually, though at
times in concert through the _N_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _A_s_s_o_c_i_a_t_i_o_n_ _o_f_ _I_n_s_u_r_a_n_c_e_ _C_o_m_m_i_s_s_i_o_n_e_r_s.

Any risk that can be quantified can potentially be insured. Specific kinds of
risk that may give rise to claims are known as perils. An insurance policy will
set out in detail which perils are covered by the policy and which are not.
Below are non-exhaustive lists of the many different types of insurance that
exist. A single policy may cover risks in one or more of the categories set out
below. For example, _v_e_h_i_c_l_e_ _i_n_s_u_r_a_n_c_e would typically cover both the property
risk (theft or damage to the vehicle) and the liability risk (legal claims
arising from an _a_c_c_i_d_e_n_t). A _h_o_m_e_ _i_n_s_u_r_a_n_c_e policy in the US typically includes
coverage for damage to the home and the owner's belongings, certain legal
claims against the owner, and even a small amount of coverage for medical
expenses of guests who are injured on the owner's property.
_B_u_s_i_n_e_s_s insurance can take a number of different forms, such as the various
kinds of professional liability insurance, also called professional indemnity
(PI), which are discussed below under that name; and the business owner's
policy (BOP), which packages into one policy many of the kinds of coverage that
a business owner needs, in a way analogous to how homeowners' insurance
packages the coverages that a homeowner needs._[_2_1_]

Gap insurance covers the excess amount on your auto loan in an instance where
your insurance company does not cover the entire loan. Depending on the
companies specific policies it might or might not cover the deductible as well.
This coverage is marketed for those who put low _d_o_w_n_ _p_a_y_m_e_n_t_s, have high
interest rates on their loans, and those with 60 month or longer terms. Gap
insurance is typically offered by your finance company when you first purchase
your vehicle. Most auto insurance companies offer this coverage to consumers as
well. If you are unsure if GAP coverage had been purchased, you should check
your vehicle lease or purchase documentation.

      insurance covers a person for a period typically up to six months, paying
      a stipend each month to cover medical bills and other necessities.
    * Long-term disability insurance covers an individual's expenses for the
      long term, up until such time as they are considered permanently disabled

Life insurance provides a monetary benefit to a decedent's family or other
designated beneficiary, and may specifically provide for income to an insured
person's family, burial, funeral and other final expenses. Life insurance
policies often allow the option of having the proceeds paid to the beneficiary
either in a lump sum cash payment or an _a_n_n_u_i_t_y. In most states, a person
cannot purchase a policy on another person without their knowledge.
Annuities provide a stream of payments and are generally classified as
insurance because they are issued by insurance companies, are regulated as
insurance, and require the same kinds of actuarial and investment management
expertise that life insurance requires. Annuities and _p_e_n_s_i_o_n_s that pay a
benefit for life are sometimes regarded as insurance against the possibility
that a _r_e_t_i_r_e_e will outlive his or her financial resources. In that sense, they
are the complement of life insurance and, from an underwriting perspective, are
the mirror image of life insurance.
Certain life insurance contracts accumulate _c_a_s_h values, which may be taken by
the insured if the policy is surrendered or which may be borrowed against. Some
policies, such as annuities and _e_n_d_o_w_m_e_n_t_ _p_o_l_i_c_i_e_s, are financial instruments
to accumulate or _l_i_q_u_i_d_a_t_e _w_e_a_l_t_h when it is needed.
In many countries, such as the United States and the UK, the _t_a_x_ _l_a_w provides
that the interest on this cash value is not taxable under certain
circumstances. This leads to widespread use of life insurance as a tax-
efficient method of _s_a_v_i_n_g as well as protection in the event of early death.
In the United States, the tax on interest income on life insurance policies and
annuities is generally deferred. However, in some cases the benefit derived
from _t_a_x_ _d_e_f_e_r_r_a_l may be offset by a low return. This depends upon the insuring
company, the type of policy and other variables (mortality, market return,
etc.). Moreover, other income tax saving vehicles (e.g., IRAs, 401(k) plans,
Roth IRAs) may be better alternatives for value accumulation.

Burial insurance is a very old type of life insurance which is paid out upon
death to cover final expenses, such as the cost of a _f_u_n_e_r_a_l. The _G_r_e_e_k_s and
_R_o_m_a_n_s introduced burial insurance c. 600 CE when they organized _g_u_i_l_d_s called
"benevolent societies" which cared for the surviving families and paid funeral
expenses of members upon death. Guilds in the _M_i_d_d_l_e_ _A_g_e_s served a similar
purpose, as did friendly societies during Victorian times.

      may also appear under this subcategory, including air traffic control and

      domestic exposures.
    * _B_o_i_l_e_r_ _i_n_s_u_r_a_n_c_e (also known as boiler and machinery insurance, or

      damage to property during construction. Builder's risk insurance is
      typically written on an "all risk" basis covering damage arising from any
      cause (including the negligence of the insured) not otherwise expressly
      excluded. Builder's risk insurance is coverage that protects a person's
      or organization's insurable interest in materials, fixtures and/or
      equipment being used in the construction or renovation of a building or
      structure should those items sustain physical loss or damage from an
      insured peril._[_2_2_]
    * _C_r_o_p_ _i_n_s_u_r_a_n_c_e may be purchased by farmers to reduce or manage various
      risks associated with growing crops. Such risks include crop loss or

      policyholder in the event of an _e_a_r_t_h_q_u_a_k_e that causes damage to the
      property. Most ordinary home insurance policies do not cover earthquake
      damage. Earthquake insurance policies generally feature a high
      _d_e_d_u_c_t_i_b_l_e. Rates depend on location and hence the likelihood of an
      earthquake, as well as the _c_o_n_s_t_r_u_c_t_i_o_n_ _o_f_ _t_h_e_ _h_o_m_e.

    * _H_o_m_e_ _i_n_s_u_r_a_n_c_e, also commonly called hazard insurance or homeowners
      insurance (often abbreviated in the real estate industry as HOI),
      provides coverage for damage or destruction of the policyholder's home.
      In some geographical areas, the policy may exclude certain types of
      risks, such as flood or earthquake, that require additional coverage.
      Maintenance-related issues are typically the homeowner's responsibility.
      The policy may include inventory, or this can be bought as a separate

      vessels at sea or on inland waterways, and of cargo in transit,
      regardless of the method of transit. When the owner of the cargo and the
      carrier are separate corporations, marine cargo insurance typically
      compensates the owner of cargo for losses sustained from fire, shipwreck,
      etc., but excludes losses that can be recovered from the carrier or the
      carrier's insurance. Many marine insurance underwriters will include
      "time element" coverage in such policies, which extends the indemnity to
      cover loss of profit and other business expenses attributable to the
      delay caused by a covered loss.

Liability insurance is a very broad superset that covers legal claims against
the insured. Many types of insurance include an aspect of liability coverage.
For example, a homeowner's insurance policy will normally include liability
coverage which protects the insured in the event of a claim brought by someone
who slips and falls on the property; automobile insurance also includes an
aspect of liability insurance that indemnifies against the harm that a crashing
car can cause to others' lives, health, or property. The protection offered by
a liability insurance policy is twofold: a legal defense in the event of a
lawsuit commenced against the policyholder and indemnification (payment on
behalf of the insured) with respect to a settlement or court verdict. Liability
policies typically cover only the negligence of the insured, and will not apply
to results of wilful or intentional acts by the insured.

      (usually a corporation) from costs associated with litigation resulting
      from errors made by directors and officers for which they are liable.
    * Environmental liability insurance protects the insured from bodily
      injury, property damage and cleanup costs as a result of the dispersal,
      release or escape of pollutants.

      DBA is required for all US citizens, US residents, US Green Card holders,
      and all employees or subcontractors hired on overseas government
      contracts. Depending on the country, foreign nationals must also be

    * Pollution insurance usually takes the form of first-party coverage for
      contamination of insured property either by external or on-site sources.
      Coverage is also afforded for liability to third parties arising from
      contamination of air, water, or land due to the sudden and accidental
      release of hazardous materials from the insured site. The policy usually
      covers the costs of cleanup and may include coverage for releases from
      underground storage tanks. Intentional acts are specifically excluded.
    * Purchase insurance is aimed at providing protection on the products
      people purchase. Purchase insurance can cover individual purchase
      protection, _w_a_r_r_a_n_t_i_e_s, _g_u_a_r_a_n_t_e_e_s, care plans and even mobile phone

    * _N_o_-_f_a_u_l_t_ _i_n_s_u_r_a_n_c_e is a type of insurance policy (typically automobile
      insurance) where insureds are indemnified by their own insurer regardless
      of fault in the incident.
    * Protected self-insurance is an alternative risk financing mechanism in
      which an organization retains the mathematically calculated cost of risk
      within the organization and transfers the catastrophic risk with specific
      and aggregate limits to an insurer so the maximum total cost of the
      program is known. A properly designed and underwritten Protected Self-
      Insurance Program reduces and stabilizes the cost of insurance and
      provides valuable risk management information.
    * Retrospectively rated insurance is a method of establishing a premium on
      large commercial accounts. The final premium is based on the insured's
      actual loss experience during the policy term, sometimes subject to a
      minimum and maximum premium, with the final premium determined by a
      formula. Under this plan, the current year's premium is based partially
      (or wholly) on the current year's losses, although the premium
      adjustments may take months or years beyond the current year's expiration
      date. The rating formula is guaranteed in the insurance contract.
      Formula: retrospective premium = converted loss + basic premium Ã tax
      multiplier. Numerous variations of this formula have been developed and
      are in use.
    * Formal _s_e_l_f_-_i_n_s_u_r_a_n_c_e is the deliberate decision to pay for otherwise
      insurable losses out of one's own money.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] This can be
      done on a formal basis by establishing a separate fund into which funds
      are deposited on a periodic basis, or by simply forgoing the purchase of
      available insurance and paying out-of-pocket. Self-insurance is usually
      used to pay for high-frequency, low-severity losses. Such losses, if
      covered by conventional insurance, mean having to pay a premium that
      includes loadings for the company's general expenses, cost of putting the
      policy on the books, acquisition expenses, premium taxes, and
      contingencies. While this is true for all insurance, for small, frequent
      losses the transaction costs may exceed the benefit of volatility
      reduction that insurance otherwise affords.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]
    * _R_e_i_n_s_u_r_a_n_c_e is a type of insurance purchased by insurance companies or

      _r_e_i_n_s_u_r_a_n_c_e is a form of reinsurance that is primarily used for capital
      management rather than to transfer insurance risk.
    * _S_o_c_i_a_l_ _i_n_s_u_r_a_n_c_e can be many things to many people in many countries. But
      a summary of its essence is that it is a collection of insurance
      coverages (including components of life insurance, disability income
      insurance, unemployment insurance, health insurance, and others), plus
      retirement savings, that requires participation by all citizens. By
      forcing everyone in society to be a policyholder and pay premiums, it
      ensures that everyone can become a claimant when or if he/she needs to.
      Along the way this inevitably becomes related to other concepts such as
      the justice system and the _w_e_l_f_a_r_e_ _s_t_a_t_e. This is a large, complicated

    * Stop-loss insurance provides protection against catastrophic or
      unpredictable losses. It is purchased by organizations who do not want to
      assume 100% of the liability for losses arising from the plans. Under a
      stop-loss policy, the insurance company becomes liable for losses that
      exceed certain limits called deductibles.

Some communities prefer to create virtual insurance amongst themselves by other
means than contractual risk transfer, which assigns explicit numerical values
to risk. A number of _r_e_l_i_g_i_o_u_s groups, including the _A_m_i_s_h and some _M_u_s_l_i_m
groups, depend on support provided by their _c_o_m_m_u_n_i_t_i_e_s when _d_i_s_a_s_t_e_r_s strike.
The risk presented by any given person is assumed collectively by the community
who all bear the cost of rebuilding lost property and supporting people whose
needs are suddenly greater after a loss of some kind. In supportive communities
where others can be trusted to follow community leaders, this tacit form of
insurance can work. In this manner the community can even out the extreme
differences in insurability that exist among its members. Some further
justification is also provided by invoking the _m_o_r_a_l_ _h_a_z_a_r_d of explicit
insurance contracts.

government building was damaged, the cost of repair would be met from public
funds because, in the long run, this was cheaper than paying insurance
premiums. Since many UK government buildings have been sold to property
companies, and rented back, this arrangement is now less common and may have
disappeared altogether.

Insurance companies may be classified into two groups:
    * Life insurance companies, which sell life insurance, annuities and
      pensions products.
    * Non-life, general, or property/casualty insurance companies, which sell
      other types of insurance.
General insurance companies can be further divided into these sub categories.
    * Standard lines
    * Excess lines
In most countries, life and non-life insurers are subject to different
regulatory regimes and different _t_a_x and _a_c_c_o_u_n_t_i_n_g rules. The main reason for
the distinction between the two types of company is that life, annuity, and
pension business is very long-term in nature â coverage for life assurance or
a pension can cover risks over many _d_e_c_a_d_e_s. By contrast, non-life insurance
cover usually covers a shorter period, such as one year.
In the United States, standard line insurance companies are insurers that have
received a license or authorization from a state for the purpose of writing
specific kinds of insurance in that state, such as automobile insurance or
homeowners' insurance._[_2_7_] They are typically referred to as "admitted"
insurers. Generally, such an insurance company must submit its rates and policy
forms to the state's insurance regulator to receive his or her prior approval,
although whether an insurance company must receive prior approval depends upon
the kind of insurance being written. Standard line insurance companies usually
charge lower premiums than excess line insurers and may sell directly to
individual insureds. They are regulated by state laws, which include
restrictions on rates and forms, and which aim to protect consumers and the
public from unfair or abusive practices._[_2_7_] These insurers also are required
to contribute to state guarantee funds, which are used to pay for losses if an
insurer becomes insolvent._[_2_7_]
Excess line insurance companies (also known as Excess and Surplus) typically
insure risks not covered by the standard lines insurance market, due to a
variety of reasons (e.g., new entity or an entity that does not have an
adequate loss history, an entity with unique risk characteristics, or an entity
that has a loss history that does not fit the underwriting requirements of the
standard lines insurance market)._[_2_7_] They are typically referred to as non-
admitted or unlicensed insurers._[_2_7_] Non-admitted insurers are generally not
licensed or authorized in the states in which they write business, although
they must be licensed or authorized in the state in which they are domiciled.
_[_2_7_] These companies have more flexibility and can react faster than standard
line insurance companies because they are not required to file rates and forms.
_[_2_7_] However, they still have substantial regulatory requirements placed upon
them.
Most states require that excess line insurers submit financial information,
articles of incorporation, a list of officers, and other general information.
_[_2_7_] They also may not write insurance that is typically available in the
admitted market, do not participate in state guarantee funds (and therefore
policyholders do not have any recourse through these funds if an insurer
becomes insolvent and cannot pay claims), may pay higher taxes, only may write
coverage for a risk if it has been rejected by three different admitted
insurers, and only when the insurance producer placing the business has a
surplus lines license._[_2_7_] Generally, when an excess line insurer writes a
policy, it must, pursuant to state laws, provide disclosure to the policyholder
that the policyholder's policy is being written by an excess line insurer._[_2_7_]
On July 21, 2010, President _B_a_r_a_c_k_ _O_b_a_m_a signed into law the _N_o_n_a_d_m_i_t_t_e_d_ _a_n_d
_R_e_i_n_s_u_r_a_n_c_e_ _R_e_f_o_r_m_ _A_c_t_ _o_f_ _2_0_1_0 ("NRRA"), which took effect on July 21, 2011 and
was part of the _D_o_d_d_-_F_r_a_n_k_ _W_a_l_l_ _S_t_r_e_e_t_ _R_e_f_o_r_m_ _a_n_d_ _C_o_n_s_u_m_e_r_ _P_r_o_t_e_c_t_i_o_n_ _A_c_t. The
NRRA changed the regulatory paradigm for excess line insurance. Generally,
under the NRRA, only the insured's home state may regulate and tax the excess
line transaction._[_2_8_]
Insurance companies are generally classified as either _m_u_t_u_a_l or proprietary
companies._[_2_9_] Mutual companies are owned by the policyholders, while
shareholders (who may or may not own policies) own proprietary insurance
companies.
_D_e_m_u_t_u_a_l_i_z_a_t_i_o_n of mutual insurers to form stock companies, as well as the
formation of a hybrid known as a mutual holding company, became common in some
countries, such as the United States, in the late 20th century. However, not
all states permit mutual holding companies.
Other possible forms for an insurance company include _r_e_c_i_p_r_o_c_a_l_s, in which
policyholders reciprocate in sharing risks, and Lloyd's organizations.
Insurance companies are rated by various agencies such as _A_._ _M_._ _B_e_s_t. The
ratings include the company's financial strength, which measures its ability to
pay claims. It also rates financial instruments issued by the insurance
company, such as bonds, notes, and securitization products.
_R_e_i_n_s_u_r_a_n_c_e companies are insurance companies that sell policies to other
insurance companies, allowing them to reduce their risks and protect themselves
from very large losses. The reinsurance market is dominated by a few very large
companies, with huge reserves. A reinsurer may also be a direct writer of
insurance risks as well.
_C_a_p_t_i_v_e_ _i_n_s_u_r_a_n_c_e companies may be defined as limited-purpose insurance
companies established with the specific objective of financing risks emanating
from their parent group or groups. This definition can sometimes be extended to
include some of the risks of the parent company's customers. In short, it is an
in-house self-insurance vehicle. Captives may take the form of a "pure" entity
(which is a 100% subsidiary of the self-insured parent company); of a "mutual"
captive (which insures the collective risks of members of an industry); and of
an "association" captive (which self-insures individual risks of the members of
a professional, commercial or industrial association). Captives represent
commercial, economic and tax advantages to their sponsors because of the
reductions in costs they help create and for the ease of insurance risk
management and the flexibility for cash flows they generate. Additionally, they
may provide coverage of risks which is neither available nor offered in the
traditional insurance market at reasonable prices.
The types of risk that a captive can underwrite for their parents include
property damage, public and product liability, professional indemnity, employee
benefits, employers' liability, motor and medical aid expenses. The captive's
