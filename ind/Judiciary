The jjuuddiicciiaarryy (also known as the jjuuddiicciiaall ssyysstteemm) is the system of _c_o_u_r_t_s that
interprets and applies the _l_a_w in the name of the _s_t_a_t_e. The judiciary also
provides a mechanism for the _r_e_s_o_l_u_t_i_o_n_ _o_f_ _d_i_s_p_u_t_e_s. Under the doctrine of the
_s_e_p_a_r_a_t_i_o_n_ _o_f_ _p_o_w_e_r_s, the judiciary generally does not make law (that is, in a
plenary fashion, which is the responsibility of the legislature) or enforce law
(which is the responsibility of the executive), but rather interprets law and
applies it to the facts of each case. This branch of the state is often tasked
with ensuring _e_q_u_a_l_ _j_u_s_t_i_c_e_ _u_n_d_e_r_ _l_a_w. It usually consists of a court of final
appeal (called the "_S_u_p_r_e_m_e_ _c_o_u_r_t" or "_C_o_n_s_t_i_t_u_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _c_o_u_r_t"), together with
lower courts.
In many jurisdictions the judicial branch has the power to change laws through
the process of _j_u_d_i_c_i_a_l_ _r_e_v_i_e_w. Courts with judicial review power may annul the
laws and rules of the state when it finds them incompatible with a higher norm,
such as _p_r_i_m_a_r_y_ _l_e_g_i_s_l_a_t_i_o_n, the provisions of the _c_o_n_s_t_i_t_u_t_i_o_n or
_i_n_t_e_r_n_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _l_a_w. Judges constitute a critical force for interpretation and
implementation of a constitution, thus de facto in _c_o_m_m_o_n_ _l_a_w countries
creating the body of constitutional law.
In the US during recent decades the judiciary became active in economic issues
related with economic rights established by constitution because "economics may
provide insight into questions that bear on the proper legal interpretation".
_[_3_] Since many countries with transitional political and economic systems
continue treating their constitutions as abstract legal documents disengaged
from the economic policy of the state, practice of judicial review of economic
acts of executive and legislative branches have begun to grow.
In the 1980s, the _S_u_p_r_e_m_e_ _C_o_u_r_t_ _o_f_ _I_n_d_i_a for almost a decade had been
encouraging _p_u_b_l_i_c_ _i_n_t_e_r_e_s_t_ _l_i_t_i_g_a_t_i_o_n on behalf of the poor and oppressed by
using a very broad interpretation of several articles of the _I_n_d_i_a_n
_C_o_n_s_t_i_t_u_t_i_o_n._[_4_]
_B_u_d_g_e_t of the judiciary in many transitional and _d_e_v_e_l_o_p_i_n_g_ _c_o_u_n_t_r_i_e_s is almost
completely controlled by the executive. The latter undermines the separation of
powers, as it creates a critical financial dependence of the judiciary. The
proper national wealth distribution including the government spending on the
judiciary is subject of the _c_o_n_s_t_i_t_u_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _e_c_o_n_o_m_i_c_s. It is important to
distinguish between the two methods of corruption of the judiciary: the state
(through budget planning and various privileges), and the private._[_5_]
The term "judiciary" is also used to refer collectively to the personnel, such
as _j_u_d_g_e_s, _m_a_g_i_s_t_r_a_t_e_s and other adjudicators, who form the core of a judiciary
(sometimes referred to as a "_b_e_n_c_h"), as well as the staffs who keep the system
running smoothly.

After the _F_r_e_n_c_h_ _R_e_v_o_l_u_t_i_o_n, lawmakers stopped interpretation of law by judges,
and the legislature was the only body permitted to interpret the law; this
prohibition was later overturned by the _C_o_d_e_ _N_a_p_o_l_√_©_o_n._[_6_]
In civil law jurisdictions at present, judges interpret the law to about the
same extent as in common law jurisdictions[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] ‚Äì however it is
different than the common law tradition which directly recognizes the limited
power to make law. For instance, in _F_r_a_n_c_e, the _j_u_r_i_s_p_r_u_d_e_n_c_e_ _c_o_n_s_t_a_n_t_e of the
_C_o_u_r_t_ _o_f_ _C_a_s_s_a_t_i_o_n or the _C_o_u_n_c_i_l_ _o_f_ _S_t_a_t_e is equivalent in practice with _c_a_s_e
_l_a_w. However, the _L_o_u_i_s_i_a_n_a_ _S_u_p_r_e_m_e_ _C_o_u_r_t notes the principal difference
between the two legal doctrines: a single _c_o_u_r_t_ _d_e_c_i_s_i_o_n can provide sufficient
foundation for the common law doctrine of stare decisis, however, "a series of
_a_d_j_u_d_i_c_a_t_e_d_ _c_a_s_e_s, all in accord, form the basis for jurisprudence constante."
_[_7_] Moreover, the Louisiana Court of Appeals has explicitly noted that
jurisprudence constante is merely a secondary source of law, which cannot be
authoritative and does not rise to the level of stare decisis. _[_8_]

    * In common law jurisdictions, courts interpret law, including
      constitutions, statutes, and regulations. They also make law (but in a
      limited sense, limited to the facts of particular cases) based upon prior
      _c_a_s_e_ _l_a_w in areas where the legislature has not made law. For instance,
      the _t_o_r_t of _n_e_g_l_i_g_e_n_c_e is not derived from statute law in most common law

    * In _c_i_v_i_l_ _l_a_w jurisdictions, courts interpret the law, but are prohibited
