A mmiilliittaarryy is an organization authorized by its greater society to _u_s_e_ _l_e_t_h_a_l
_f_o_r_c_e, usually including use of weapons, in defending its country by combating
actual or _p_e_r_c_e_i_v_e_d_ _t_h_r_e_a_t_s. The military may have additional functions of use
to its greater society, such as advancing a _p_o_l_i_t_i_c_a_l_ _a_g_e_n_d_a e.g. _m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y
_j_u_n_t_a, supporting or promoting economic expansion through imperialism, and as a
form of internal social control. As an adjective the term "military" is also
used to refer to any property or aspect of a military. Militaries often
function as societies within societies, by having their own military
communities.
The profession of _s_o_l_d_i_e_r_i_n_g as part of a military is older than _r_e_c_o_r_d_e_d
_h_i_s_t_o_r_y itself. Some of the most enduring images of the _c_l_a_s_s_i_c_a_l_ _a_n_t_i_q_u_i_t_y
portray the power and feats of its military _l_e_a_d_e_r_s. The _B_a_t_t_l_e_ _o_f_ _K_a_d_e_s_h in
1274 BC was one of the defining points of Pharaoh _R_a_m_e_s_s_e_s_ _I_I's reign and is
celebrated in bas-relief on his monuments. A thousand years later the first
emperor of unified China, Qin Shi Huang, was so determined to impress the gods
with his military might that he was buried with an army of _t_e_r_r_a_c_o_t_t_a_ _s_o_l_d_i_e_r_s.
_[_1_] The _R_o_m_a_n_s were dedicated to military matters, leaving to posterity many
_t_r_e_a_t_i_s_e_s and writings as well as a large number of lavishly carved _t_r_i_u_m_p_h_a_l

_P_r_a_e_t_o_r_i_a_n_ _G_u_a_r_d_s, Elite Roman Soldiers
The first recorded use of the word mmiilliittaarryy in English, spelled militarie, was
in 1585._[_2_] It comes from the Latin militaris (from Latin miles meaning
"soldier") but is of uncertain etymology, one suggestion being derived from
*mil-it- - going in a body or mass._[_3_] The word is now identified as denoting
someone that is skilled in use of weapons, or engaged in military service or in
warfare._[_4_]_[_5_]
As a noun tthhee mmiilliittaarryy usually refers generally to a country's _a_r_m_e_d_ _f_o_r_c_e_s or
sometimes, more specifically, to the senior officers who command them._[_4_]_[_5_] In
general it refers to the physicality of armed forces, their personnel,
equipment, and physical area which they occupy.
As an adjective mmiilliittaarryy originally referred only to soldiers and soldiering,
but it soon broadened to apply to land forces in general and anything to do
with their profession._[_2_] The names of both the _R_o_y_a_l_ _M_i_l_i_t_a_r_y_ _A_c_a_d_e_m_y (1741)

time of the _N_a_p_o_l_e_o_n_i_c_ _W_a_r_s, "military" began to be used in reference to armed
forces as a whole_[_2_] and in the 21st century expressions like "_m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y
_s_e_r_v_i_c_e", "_m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y_ _i_n_t_e_l_l_i_g_e_n_c_e" and "_m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y_ _h_i_s_t_o_r_y" encompass naval,
marine and air force aspects. As such, it now connotes any activity performed
by military personnel.

Military history is often considered to be the history of all conflicts, not
just the history of the state militaries. It differs somewhat from the _h_i_s_t_o_r_y
_o_f_ _w_a_r with military history focusing on the people and institutions of war-
making while the history of war focuses on the evolution of war itself in the
face of changing technology, governments, and geography.
Military history has a number of purposes. One main purpose is to learn from
past accomplishments and mistakes so as to more effectively wage war in the
future. Another is to create a sense of _m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y_ _t_r_a_d_i_t_i_o_n which is used to
create cohesive military forces. Still another may be to learn to prevent wars
more effectively. Human knowledge about the military is largely based on both
recorded and _o_r_a_l_ _h_i_s_t_o_r_y of military conflicts (war), their participating
_a_r_m_i_e_s and _n_a_v_i_e_s and, more recently, _a_i_r_ _f_o_r_c_e_s.
There are two types of military history, although almost all texts have
elements of both: descriptive history that serves to chronicle conflicts
without offering any statements about the _c_a_u_s_e_s, _n_a_t_u_r_e_ _o_f_ _c_o_n_d_u_c_t, the ending
and _e_f_f_e_c_t_s of a conflict; and _a_n_a_l_y_t_i_c_a_l_ _h_i_s_t_o_r_y that seeks to offer
statements about the causes, nature, ending and aftermath of conflicts as a
means of deriving knowledge and understanding of conflicts as a whole, and
prevent repetition of mistakes in future, to suggest better concepts or methods
in employing forces, or to advocate the need for new technology.
Another aspect of US military history is the _c_h_a_l_l_e_n_g_e_ _c_o_i_n,_[_6_] also called
commanders coins, they are usually given as awards of recognition and
achievement, and often _l_a_p_e_l_ _p_i_n_s_[_7_] are also given as a recognition device of
a military association or organization.

In the whole history of humanity, every nation had different needs for military
forces. How these needs are determined forms the basis of their composition,
equipment and use of facilities. It also determines what military does in terms
of peacetime and wartime activities.
All militaries, whether large or small, are _m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y_ _o_r_g_a_n_i_z_a_t_i_o_n_s that must
perform certain functions and fulfil certain roles to qualify for being
designated as such. If they fail to do so, they may become known as
_p_a_r_a_m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y, _c_i_v_i_l_ _d_e_f_e_n_c_e, _m_i_l_i_t_i_a or other which are not military. These
commonalities of the state's military define them.

The first requirement of the military is to establish it as a force with the
capability to execute _n_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _d_e_f_e_n_c_e_ _p_o_l_i_c_y. Invariably, although the _p_o_l_i_c_y
may be created by _p_o_l_i_c_y_ _m_a_k_e_r_s or _P_o_l_i_c_y_ _a_n_a_l_y_s_t, its implementation requires
specific expert knowledge of how the military functions and how it fulfils
roles.
The first of these skills is the ability to create a cohesive force capable of
acting on policy as and when required, and therefore the first function of the
military is to provide _m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y_ _c_o_m_m_a_n_d. One of the roles of military command
is to translate policy into concrete missions and tasks, and to express them in
terms understood by subordinates, generally called orders.

large as _m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y_ _d_i_s_t_r_i_c_t_s or military zones, and as small as _p_l_a_t_o_o_n_s. The
command element of the military is often a strong influence on the
organisational culture of the forces.

Another requirement is for the military command personnel, often called the
_o_f_f_i_c_e_r_ _c_o_r_p_s, to command subordinated _m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y_ _p_e_r_s_o_n_n_e_l, generally known as
_s_o_l_d_i_e_r_s, _s_a_i_l_o_r_s, _m_a_r_i_n_e_s, or _a_i_r_m_e_n, capable of executing the many
specialised _o_p_e_r_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _m_i_s_s_i_o_n_s and tasks required for the military to execute
policy directives.
Just as in the _c_o_m_m_e_r_c_i_a_l_ _e_n_t_e_r_p_r_i_s_e_s where there are, in a corporate setting,
directors, managers and various staff that carry out the business of the day as
part of _b_u_s_i_n_e_s_s_ _o_p_e_r_a_t_i_o_n_s or undertake business _p_r_o_j_e_c_t_ _m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t, the
military also has its _r_o_u_t_i_n_e_s and projects.
During peacetime, when military personnel are mostly employed in _g_a_r_r_i_s_o_n_s or
permanent military facilities, they mostly conduct administrative tasks,
_t_r_a_i_n_i_n_g and _e_d_u_c_a_t_i_o_n activities, and _t_e_c_h_n_o_l_o_g_y_ _m_a_i_n_t_e_n_a_n_c_e. Another role of
military personnel is to ensure a continuous replacement of departing
servicemen and women through _m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y_ _r_e_c_r_u_i_t_m_e_n_t, and the maintenance of a
_m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y_ _r_e_s_e_r_v_e.

The next requirement comes as a fairly basic need for the military to identify
possible _t_h_r_e_a_t_s it may be called upon to face. For this purpose some of the
commanding forces and other military, as well as often civilian personnel
participate in identification of these threats. This is at once an
organisation, a system and a process collectively called _m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y_ _i_n_t_e_l_l_i_g_e_n_c_e
(MI).
The difficulty in using military intelligence concepts and military
intelligence methods is in the nature of the _s_e_c_r_e_c_y of the information they
seek, and the _c_l_a_n_d_e_s_t_i_n_e nature that intelligence operatives work in obtaining
what may be plans for a _c_o_n_f_l_i_c_t_ _e_s_c_a_l_a_t_i_o_n, _i_n_i_t_i_a_t_i_o_n_ _o_f_ _c_o_m_b_a_t or an
_i_n_v_a_s_i_o_n.
An important part of the military intelligence role is the military analysis
performed to assess _m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y_ _c_a_p_a_b_i_l_i_t_y of potential future aggressors, and
provide combat modelling that helps to understand factors on which comparison
of forces can be made. This helps to quantify and qualify such statements as
"_C_h_i_n_a and _I_n_d_i_a maintain the largest armed forces in the World" or that "the
_U_._S_._ _M_i_l_i_t_a_r_y is considered to be the world's strongest"._[_8_]
Guerrilla structure
Although some groups engaged in combat, such as militants or _r_e_s_i_s_t_a_n_c_e
_m_o_v_e_m_e_n_t_s, refer to themselves using military terminology, notably "Army" or
"Front", none have had the structure of a national military to justify the
reference, and usually have had to rely on support of outside national
militaries. They also use these terms to conceal from the MI their true
capabilities, and to impress potential ideological recruits.
Having military intelligence representatives participate in the execution of
the national defence policy is important because it becomes the first
respondent and commentator on the policy expected _s_t_r_a_t_e_g_i_c_ _g_o_a_l compared to
the realities of _i_d_e_n_t_i_f_i_e_d_ _t_h_r_e_a_t_s. When the intelligence reporting is
compared to the policy, it becomes possible for the national leadership to
think about allocating resources over an above the officers and their
subordinates military pay and the expense of maintaining military facilities
and military support services for them.

military. Military procurement is then authorised to purchase or contract
provision of goods and services to the military, whether in peacetime at a
permanent base or in a combat zone from local population.

Capability development, which is often referred to as the military "strength",
is arguably one of the most complex activities known to humanity because it
requires determining: Strategic, operational and tactical capability
requirements to counter the identified threats; Strategic, _o_p_e_r_a_t_i_o_n_a_l and
tactical doctrines by which the acquired capabilities will be used; identifying
concepts, methods and systems involved in executing the doctrines; creating
design specifications for the manufacturers who would produce these in adequate
quantity and quality for their use in combat; purchase the concepts, methods
and systems; create a forces structure that would use the concepts, methods and
systems most effectively and efficiently; integrate these concepts, methods and
systems into the force structure by providing _m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y_ _e_d_u_c_a_t_i_o_n, _t_r_a_i_n_i_n_g, and
_p_r_a_c_t_i_c_e that preferably resembles combat environment of intended use; create
_m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y_ _l_o_g_i_s_t_i_c_s systems to allow continued and uninterrupted performance of
_m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y_ _o_r_g_a_n_i_s_a_t_i_o_n_s under combat conditions, including provision of health
services to the personnel and maintenance for the equipment; the services to
assist recovery of wounded personnel and repair of damaged equipment; and
finally post-conflict _d_e_m_o_b_i_l_i_s_a_t_i_o_n and disposal of war stocks surplus to
peacetime requirements.
Development of _m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y_ _d_o_c_t_r_i_n_e is perhaps the more important of all
capability development activities because it determines how military forces
were, and are used in conflicts, the concepts and methods used by the command
to employ appropriately military skilled, _a_r_m_e_d and _e_q_u_i_p_p_e_d personnel in
achievement of the tangible goals and objectives of the _w_a_r, _c_a_m_p_a_i_g_n, _b_a_t_t_l_e,
engagement, action or a _d_u_e_l._[_9_] The line between strategy and tactics is not
easily blurred, although deciding which is being discussed had sometimes been a
matter of personal judgement by some commentators, and military historians. The
use of forces at the level of organisation between strategic and tactical is
called _o_p_e_r_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _m_o_b_i_l_i_t_y.

Because most of the concepts and methods used by the military, and many of its

The primary reason for the existence of the military is to engage in _c_o_m_b_a_t,
should it be required to do so by the national defence policy, and to win. This
represents an organizational goal of any military, and the primary focus for
military thought through _m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y_ _h_i_s_t_o_r_y.
The "show" of military force has been a term that referred as much to military
force projection, as to the units such as _r_e_g_i_m_e_n_t_s or _g_u_n_b_o_a_t_s _d_e_p_l_o_y_e_d in a
particular theatre, or as an aggregate of such forces. In the _G_u_l_f_ _W_a_r the
_U_n_i_t_e_d_ _S_t_a_t_e_s_ _C_e_n_t_r_a_l_ _C_o_m_m_a_n_d controlled military forces (units) of each of the
four military services of the United States. How _v_i_c_t_o_r_y is achieved, and what
shape it assumes is studied by most, if not all, military groups on three
levels.

term projection of belligerents' policy with a broad view of outcome
implications, including outside the concerns of military command. Military
strategy is more concerned with the _s_u_p_p_l_y_ _o_f_ _w_a_r and planning, then management
of field forces and combat between them. The scope of Strategic military
planning can span weeks, but is more often months or even years._[_9_]
  Operational victory
_O_p_e_r_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _m_o_b_i_l_i_t_y is, within _w_a_r_f_a_r_e and _m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y_ _d_o_c_t_r_i_n_e, the level of
command which coordinates the minute details of _t_a_c_t_i_c_s with the overarching
goals of _s_t_r_a_t_e_g_y. A common synonym is operational art.
The operational level is at a scale bigger than one where line of sight and the
time of day are important, and smaller than the strategic level, where
production and politics are considerations. Formations are of the operational
level if they are able to conduct operations on their own, and are of
sufficient sise to be directly handled or have a significant impact at the
strategic level. This concept was pioneered by the _G_e_r_m_a_n army prior to and
during the _S_e_c_o_n_d_ _W_o_r_l_d_ _W_a_r. At this level planning and duration of activities
takes from one week to a month, and are executed by _F_i_e_l_d_ _A_r_m_i_e_s and _A_r_m_y_ _C_o_r_p_s

_M_i_l_i_t_a_r_y_ _t_a_c_t_i_c_s concerns itself with the methods for engaging and defeating an
enemy in direct combat. Military tactics are usually used by units over hours
or days, and are focused on the specific, close proximity tasks and objectives
of _s_q_u_a_d_s, _c_o_m_p_a_n_i_e_s, _b_a_t_t_a_l_i_o_n_s, _r_e_g_i_m_e_n_t_s, _b_r_i_g_a_d_e_s and _d_i_v_i_s_i_o_n_s and their

One of the oldest military publications is _T_h_e_ _A_r_t_ _o_f_ _W_a_r by the _C_h_i_n_e_s_e

intended as military instruction and not as _m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y_ _t_h_e_o_r_y, but has had a huge
influence on Asian military doctrine, and from the late 19th century, on

Battle formation and tactics of _M_a_c_e_d_o_n_[_1_1_]
The Classical Greeks and the Romans wrote prolifically on _m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y_ _c_a_m_p_a_i_g_n_i_n_g.
Among the best-known Roman works are _J_u_l_i_u_s_ _C_a_e_s_a_r's commentaries on the _G_a_l_l_i_c
_W_a_r_s and the _R_o_m_a_n_ _C_i_v_i_l_ _w_a_r - written about 50 BC.
Two major works on tactics come from the late Roman period: Taktike Theoria by
_A_e_l_i_a_n_u_s_ _T_a_c_t_i_c_u_s and _D_e_ _R_e_ _M_i_l_i_t_a_r_i ("On military matters") by _V_e_g_e_t_i_u_s.
Taktike Theoria examined Greek military tactics, and was most influential in
the _B_y_z_a_n_t_i_n_e world and during the _G_o_l_d_e_n_ _A_g_e_ _o_f_ _I_s_l_a_m.
De Re Militari formed the basis of European military tactics until the late
17th century. Perhaps its most enduring maxim is _I_g_i_t_u_r_ _q_u_i_ _d_e_s_i_d_e_r_a_t_ _p_a_c_e_m_,
_p_r_a_e_p_a_r_e_t_ _b_e_l_l_u_m (let he who desires peace prepare for war).
Due to the changing nature of combat with the introduction of _a_r_t_i_l_l_e_r_y in the
European _M_i_d_d_l_e_ _A_g_e_s, and infantry firearms in the _R_e_n_a_i_s_s_a_n_c_e, attempts were
made to define and identify those strategies, _g_r_a_n_d_ _t_a_c_t_i_c_s and tactics that
would produce a victory more often than that achieved by the Romans in praying
to the gods before the battle.
Later this became known as _M_i_l_i_t_a_r_y_ _S_c_i_e_n_c_e, and later still would adopt the
_s_c_i_e_n_t_i_f_i_c_ _m_e_t_h_o_d approach to the conduct of military operations under the
influence of the _I_n_d_u_s_t_r_i_a_l_ _R_e_v_o_l_u_t_i_o_n thinking. In his seminal book _O_n_ _W_a_r the
_P_r_u_s_s_i_a_n _M_a_j_o_r_-_G_e_n_e_r_a_l and leading _e_x_p_e_r_t on modern _m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y_ _s_t_r_a_t_e_g_y _C_a_r_l_ _v_o_n
_C_l_a_u_s_e_w_i_t_z defined military strategy as "the employment of battles to gain the
end of war."_[_1_2_] According to Clausewitz
     strategy forms the plan of the War, and to this end it links together
     the series of acts which are to lead to the final decision, that is
     to say, it makes the plans for the separate campaigns and regulates
     the combats to be fought in each._[_1_3_]
Hence, Clausewitz placed political aims above _m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y_ _g_o_a_l_s, ensuring _c_i_v_i_l_i_a_n
_c_o_n_t_r_o_l_ _o_f_ _t_h_e_ _m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y. Military strategy was one of a triumvirate of _"_a_r_t_s_"
or "sciences" that governed the conduct of warfare, the others being: _m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y
_t_a_c_t_i_c_s, the execution of plans and _m_a_n_Å__u_v_e_r_i_n_g_ _o_f_ _f_o_r_c_e_s_ _i_n_ _b_a_t_t_l_e, and
_m_a_i_n_t_e_n_a_n_c_e_ _o_f_ _a_n_ _a_r_m_y.
The meaning of military tactics has changed over time from the deployment and
manoeuvreing of entire land armies on the fields of ancient battles, and galley
fleets, to modern use of small unit _a_m_b_u_s_h_e_s, _e_n_c_i_r_c_l_e_m_e_n_t_s, bomb and
bombardment attacks, _f_r_o_n_t_a_l_ _a_s_s_a_u_l_t_s, _a_i_r_ _a_s_s_a_u_l_t_s, _h_i_t_-_a_n_d_-_r_u_n_ _t_a_c_t_i_c_s used
mainly by _g_u_e_r_r_i_l_l_a forces and, in some cases, _s_u_i_c_i_d_e_ _a_t_t_a_c_k_s on land and at
sea. Evolution of aerial warfare introduced its own _a_i_r_ _c_o_m_b_a_t_ _t_a_c_t_i_c_s. Often,
_m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y_ _d_e_c_e_p_t_i_o_n, in the form of _m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y_ _c_a_m_o_u_f_l_a_g_e or misdirection using
_d_e_c_o_y_s, is used to confuse the enemy as a tactic.
A major development in _i_n_f_a_n_t_r_y_ _t_a_c_t_i_c_s came with the increased use of _t_r_e_n_c_h
_w_a_r_f_a_r_e in the 19th and 20th century. This was mainly employed in _W_o_r_l_d_ _W_a_r_ _I
in the _G_a_l_l_i_p_o_l_i_ _c_a_m_p_a_i_g_n and the _W_e_s_t_e_r_n_ _F_r_o_n_t. Trench warfare often turned to
a stalemate, only broken by a large loss of life, because in order to attack an
enemy entrenchment soldiers had to run through an exposed "_n_o_ _m_a_n_'_s_ _l_a_n_d" under
heavy fire from an entrenched enemy.

As with any occupation, since the ancient times the military has been
distinguished from other members of the society by their tools, the military
weapons and _m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y_ _e_q_u_i_p_m_e_n_t used in combat. When _S_t_o_n_e_ _A_g_e humans first took
a sliver of flint to tip the _s_p_e_a_r, it was the first example of _a_p_p_l_y_i_n_g
_t_e_c_h_n_o_l_o_g_y to improve the weapon.
Since then, the advances made by human societies and that of weapons has been
irretrievably linked. Stone weapons gave way to _B_r_o_n_z_e_ _A_g_e weapons, and later
the _I_r_o_n_ _A_g_e weapons. With each technological change was realised some tangible
increase in military capability, such as through greater effectiveness of a
sharper edge in defeating _l_e_a_t_h_e_r_ _a_r_m_o_u_r, or _i_m_p_r_o_v_e_d_ _d_e_n_s_i_t_y_ _o_f_ _m_a_t_e_r_i_a_l_s used
in manufacture of weapons.
On _l_a_n_d the first really significant technological advance in warfare was the
development of the _r_a_n_g_e_d_ _w_e_a_p_o_n_s and notably the _s_l_i_n_g. The next significant
advance came with the _d_o_m_e_s_t_i_c_a_t_i_o_n_ _o_f_ _t_h_e_ _h_o_r_s_e_s and mastering of _h_o_r_s_e
_r_i_d_i_n_g.
Mounted _a_r_m_o_r_e_d _k_n_i_g_h_t. Armor and _c_a_v_a_l_r_y dominated the battlefield until the
invention of _f_i_r_e_a_r_m_s.
Arguably the greatest invention that affected not just the military, but all
society, after adoption of fire, was the _w_h_e_e_l, and its use in the construction
of the _c_h_a_r_i_o_t. There were no advances in military technology until, from the
mechanical arm action of a _s_l_i_n_g_e_r, the _G_r_e_e_k_s, _E_g_y_p_t_i_a_n_s, _R_o_m_a_n_s, _P_e_r_s_i_a_n_s,
_C_h_i_n_e_s_e, etc. development the _s_i_e_g_e_ _e_n_g_i_n_e_s. The _b_o_w was manufactured in
increasingly larger and more powerful versions to increase both the weapon
range and armour penetration performance. These developed into the powerful
composite and/or recurve bows, and crossbows of _A_n_c_i_e_n_t_ _C_h_i_n_a. These proved
particularly useful during the rise of cavalry, encased in ever-more
sophisticated _a_r_m_o_u_r, dominating the battlefield.
Somewhat earlier in medieval China, _g_u_n_p_o_w_d_e_r had been invented, and was
increasingly used by the military in combat. The use of gunpowder in the early
_v_a_s_e_-_l_i_k_e_ _m_o_r_t_a_r_s in Europe, and advanced versions of the _l_o_n_g_ _b_o_w and _c_r_o_s_s
_b_o_w, which all had armour-piercing _a_r_r_o_w_h_e_a_d_s, that put an end to the dominance
of the armoured knight. After the long bow, which required great skill and
strength to use, the next most significant technological advance was the
_m_u_s_k_e_t, which could be used effectively with little training. In time the
successors to muskets and _c_a_n_n_o_n, in the form of _r_i_f_l_e_s and _a_r_t_i_l_l_e_r_y, would
become core battlefield technology.
As the speed of technological advances accelerated in civilian applications, so
too warfare became more _i_n_d_u_s_t_r_a_l_i_s_e_d. The newly invented _m_a_c_h_i_n_e_ _g_u_n and
_r_e_p_e_a_t_i_n_g_ _r_i_f_l_e redefined _f_i_r_e_p_o_w_e_r on the battlefield and, in part, explains
the high casualty rates of the _A_m_e_r_i_c_a_n_ _C_i_v_i_l_ _W_a_r. The next breakthrough was
the conversion of artillery parks from the _m_u_z_z_l_e_ _l_o_a_d_i_n_g_ _g_u_n_s to the _b_r_e_e_c_h
_l_o_a_d_i_n_g_ _g_u_n_s, and in particular the highly mobile, recoilless, field-gun, the
French _S_o_i_x_a_n_t_e_-_Q_u_i_n_z_e, in the late 19th century.
The development of breech loading had the greatest effect on _n_a_v_a_l_ _w_a_r_f_a_r_e, for
the first time since the Middle Ages altering the way weapons are mounted on
_w_a_r_s_h_i_p_s, and therefore _n_a_v_a_l_ _t_a_c_t_i_c_s, now divorced from the reliance on _s_a_i_l_s
with the invention of the _i_n_t_e_r_n_a_l_ _c_o_m_b_u_s_t_i_o_n. A further advance in military
naval technology was the design of the _s_u_b_m_a_r_i_n_e and its weapon, the _t_o_r_p_e_d_o.
_M_a_i_n_ _b_a_t_t_l_e_ _t_a_n_k_s and other heavy equipment such as _A_F_V_s, _w_a_r_p_l_a_n_e_s and _s_h_i_p_s
are characteristic to organised military forces.
During _W_o_r_l_d_ _W_a_r_ _I the need to break the deadlock of the trenches saw the rapid
development of many new technologies, particularly the _t_a_n_k_s and _m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y
_a_v_i_a_t_i_o_n. Military aviation was extensively used, and particularly the _b_o_m_b_e_r_s
during the _W_o_r_l_d_ _W_a_r_ _I_I, which marked the most frantic period of weapons
development in history. Many new designs and concepts were used in combat, and
all existing technologies were improved between 1939 and 1945.
During the war significant advances were made in _m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y_ _c_o_m_m_u_n_i_c_a_t_i_o_n_s
through use of radio, military intelligence through use of the _r_a_d_a_r, and in
_m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y_ _m_e_d_i_c_i_n_e through use of _p_e_n_i_c_i_l_l_i_n, while in the air the _m_i_s_s_i_l_e, _j_e_t
_a_i_r_c_r_a_f_t and _h_e_l_i_c_o_p_t_e_r_s were seen for the first time. Perhaps the most
infamous of all military technologies was the creation of the _a_t_o_m_i_c_ _b_o_m_b,
although the effects of _r_a_d_i_a_t_i_o_n were unknown until the early 1950s. Far
greater use of _m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y_ _v_e_h_i_c_l_e_s had finally eliminated the cavalry from the

After World War II, with the onset of the _C_o_l_d_ _W_a_r, the constant technological
development of new weapons was institutionalised as participants engaged in a
constant _a_r_m_s_ _r_a_c_e in capability development. This constant state of weapons
development continues into the present, and remains a constant drain on
national resources, which some blame on the _m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y_-_i_n_d_u_s_t_r_i_a_l_ _c_o_m_p_l_e_x.
The most significant technological developments that influenced combat have
been the guided missiles which are used by all Services. More recently,
information technology, and its use in surveillance, including space-based
reconnaissance systems, have played an increasing role in military operations.

communication systems, and military databases has been coupled with the new
development in military technology has been the use of robotic systems in
intelligence combat, both in hardware and software applications.
Recently, there has also been a particular focus towards the use of _r_e_n_e_w_a_b_l_e
_f_u_e_l_s for running military vehicles on. Unlike fossil fuels, renewable fuels
can be produced in any country, creating a strategic advantage. The US military
has already committed itself to have 50% of its energy consumption come from
alternative sources._[_1_4_]

For much of military history the armed forces were considered to be for use by
the heads of their societies, until recently, the crowned heads of states. In a
democracy or other political system run in the public interest, it is a _p_u_b_l_i_c
_f_o_r_c_e.
The relationship between the military and the _s_o_c_i_e_t_y it serves is a
complicated and ever-evolving one. Much depends on the nature of the society
itself and whether it sees the military as important, as for example in time of
threat or war, or a burdensome expense typified by defence cuts in time of
peace.
One difficult matter in the relation between military and society is control
and transparency. In many countries only few information on military operations
and budgeting is accessible for the public. However transparency in the
military sector is crucial to fight _c_o_r_r_u_p_t_i_o_n. This showed the Government
Defence Anti-corruption Index _T_r_a_n_s_p_a_r_e_n_c_y_ _I_n_t_e_r_n_a_t_i_o_n_a_l published in 2013._[_1_5_]
These relationships are seen from the perspective of _p_o_l_i_t_i_c_a_l_-_m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y
_r_e_l_a_t_i_o_n_s, the military-industrial complex mentioned above, and the socio-
military relationship. The last can be divided between those segments of
society that offer _s_u_p_p_o_r_t_ _f_o_r_ _t_h_e_ _m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y, those who voice _o_p_p_o_s_i_t_i_o_n_ _t_o_ _t_h_e
_m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y, the voluntary and involuntary civilians in the military forces, the
populations of civilians in a combat zone, and of course the military's self-
perception.
Militaries often function as _s_o_c_i_e_t_i_e_s within societies, by having their own
military communities, _e_c_o_n_o_m_i_e_s, _e_d_u_c_a_t_i_o_n, _m_e_d_i_c_i_n_e and other aspects of a
functioning _c_i_v_i_l_i_a_n_ _s_o_c_i_e_t_y. Although a "military" is not limited to nations
in of itself as many _p_r_i_v_a_t_e_ _m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y_ _c_o_m_p_a_n_i_e_s (or PMC's) can be used or
"hired" by organisations and figures as security, escort, or other means of
protection where police, agencies, or militaries are absent or not trusted.

Militarist ideology is the _s_o_c_i_e_t_y's _s_o_c_i_a_l_ _a_t_t_i_t_u_d_e of being best served, or
being a beneficiary of a _g_o_v_e_r_n_m_e_n_t, or guided by concepts embodied in the
military culture, doctrine, system, or leaders.
Either because of the _c_u_l_t_u_r_a_l_ _m_e_m_o_r_y, national history, or the potentiality of
a _m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y_ _t_h_r_e_a_t, the militarist argument asserts that a _c_i_v_i_l_i_a_n population
is dependent upon, and thereby subservient to the needs and goals of its
military for continued _i_n_d_e_p_e_n_d_e_n_c_e. Militarism is sometimes contrasted with
the concepts of _c_o_m_p_r_e_h_e_n_s_i_v_e_ _n_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _p_o_w_e_r, _s_o_f_t_ _p_o_w_e_r and _h_a_r_d_ _p_o_w_e_r.
Most nations have separate _m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y_ _l_a_w_s which regulate conduct in war and
during peacetime. An early exponent was _H_u_g_o_ _G_r_o_t_i_u_s, whose _O_n_ _t_h_e_ _L_a_w_ _o_f_ _W_a_r
_a_n_d_ _P_e_a_c_e (1625) had a major impact of the humanitarian approach to warfare
development. His theme was echoed by _G_u_s_t_a_v_u_s_ _A_d_o_l_p_h_u_s.
Ethics of warfare have developed since 1945 to create constraints on the
military treatment of prisoners and civilians primarily by the _G_e_n_e_v_a
_C_o_n_v_e_n_t_i_o_n_s, but rarely apply to use of the military forces as internal
security troops during times of political conflict that results in popular
protests and incitement to _p_o_p_u_l_a_r_ _u_p_r_i_s_i_n_g.
International protocols restrict the use, or have even created international
bans on weapons, notably _w_e_a_p_o_n_s_ _o_f_ _m_a_s_s_ _d_e_s_t_r_u_c_t_i_o_n. _I_n_t_e_r_n_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _c_o_n_v_e_n_t_i_o_n_s
define what constitutes a _w_a_r_ _c_r_i_m_e and provides for war crimes prosecution.
Individual countries also have elaborate codes of _m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y_ _j_u_s_t_i_c_e, an example
being the United States' _U_n_i_f_o_r_m_ _C_o_d_e_ _o_f_ _M_i_l_i_t_a_r_y_ _J_u_s_t_i_c_e that can lead to
_c_o_u_r_t_ _m_a_r_t_i_a_l for military personnel found guilty of war crimes.
Military actions are sometimes argued to be justified by furthering a
humanitarian cause such as _d_i_s_a_s_t_e_r_ _r_e_l_i_e_f operations or in defence of
refugees. The term _m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y_ _h_u_m_a_n_i_s_m is used to refer to such actions.

Antimilitarism is the _s_o_c_i_e_t_y's _s_o_c_i_a_l_ _a_t_t_i_t_u_d_e opposed to war between states,
and in particular countering arguments based on _m_i_l_i_t_a_r_i_s_m. Following _H_e_g_e_l's
exploration of the relationship between _h_i_s_t_o_r_y_ _a_n_d_ _v_i_o_l_e_n_c_e, antimilistarists
argue that there are different types of violence, some of which can be said to
be legitimate others non-legitimate. _A_n_a_r_c_h_o_-_s_y_n_d_i_c_a_l_i_s_t _G_e_o_r_g_e_s_ _S_o_r_e_l
advocated the use of violence as a form of _d_i_r_e_c_t_ _a_c_t_i_o_n, calling it
_"_r_e_v_o_l_u_t_i_o_n_a_r_y_ _v_i_o_l_e_n_c_e_", which he opposed in Reflections on Violence (1908) to
the violence inherent in _c_l_a_s_s_ _s_t_r_u_g_g_l_e. Sorel thus followed the _I_n_t_e_r_n_a_t_i_o_n_a_l
_W_o_r_k_i_n_g_m_e_n_'_s_ _A_s_s_o_c_i_a_t_i_o_n theorization of _p_r_o_p_a_g_a_n_d_a_ _o_f_ _t_h_e_ _d_e_e_d.
War, as violence, can be distinguished into war between states, and _c_i_v_i_l_ _w_a_r,
in which case class struggle is, according to antimilitarists theorists, a
primordial component. Hence, _M_a_r_x's influence on antimilitarist doctrine was
not surprising, although making Marx accountable for the antimilitarist
tradition is a large overstatement. The belief in the eternal antimilitarist
spirit, present in all places and time, is however a myth because the modern
military as an institution is a historic achievement formed during the 18th and
19th centuries, as a by-product of the modern nation-states. _N_a_p_o_l_e_o_n's

in war literature. Not all of this has been entirely complementary and the
military have been lampooned or ridiculed as often as they have been idolised.
The classical Greek writer _A_r_i_s_t_o_p_h_a_n_e_s, devoted an entire _c_o_m_e_d_y, _L_y_s_i_s_t_r_a_t_a,

19th century, irreverence towards authority was at its height and for every
elegant military gentleman painted by the master-_p_o_r_t_r_a_i_t_i_s_t_s of the European
courts for example, _G_a_i_n_s_b_o_r_o_u_g_h, _G_o_y_a and _R_e_y_n_o_l_d_s, there are the sometimes
affectionate and sometimes savage _c_a_r_i_c_a_t_u_r_e_s of _R_o_w_l_a_n_d and _H_o_g_a_r_t_h.
This continued in the 19th century, with publications like _P_u_n_c_h in the _B_r_i_t_i_s_h
_E_m_p_i_r_e and _L_e_ _P_Ã_¨_r_e_ _D_u_c_h_e_s_n_e in _F_r_a_n_c_e, poking fun at the _m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y

The increasing importance of _c_i_n_e_m_a in the early 20th century provided a new
platform for depictions of military subjects. During the _F_i_r_s_t_ _W_o_r_l_d_ _W_a_r,
although heavily _c_e_n_s_o_r_e_d, _n_e_w_s_r_e_e_l_s enabled those at home to see for
themselves a heavily sanitised version of life at the front line. About the
same time, both _p_r_o_-_w_a_r and _a_n_t_i_-_w_a_r_ _f_i_l_m_s came to the _s_i_l_v_e_r_ _s_c_r_e_e_n. One of
the first films on _m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y_ _a_v_i_a_t_i_o_n, _H_e_l_l_'_s_ _A_n_g_e_l_s, broke all box office
records on its _r_e_l_e_a_s_e in 1929. Soon, _w_a_r_ _f_i_l_m_s of all types were showing
throughout the world, notably those of _C_h_a_r_l_i_e_ _C_h_a_p_l_i_n who actively promoted
_w_a_r_ _b_o_n_d_s and voluntary enlistment.
The First World War was also responsible for a new kind of military depiction,
through _p_o_e_t_r_y. Hitherto, poetry had been used mostly to glorify or sanctify
war. _T_h_e_ _C_h_a_r_g_e_ _o_f_ _t_h_e_ _L_i_g_h_t_ _B_r_i_g_a_d_e by _A_l_f_r_e_d_,_ _L_o_r_d_ _T_e_n_n_y_s_o_n, with its
_g_a_l_l_o_p_i_n_g _h_o_o_f_b_e_a_t _r_h_y_t_h_m, is a prime late _V_i_c_t_o_r_i_a_n example of this, though
_R_u_d_y_a_r_d_ _K_i_p_l_i_n_g had written a scathing reply, _T_h_e_ _L_a_s_t_ _o_f_ _t_h_e_ _L_i_g_h_t_ _B_r_i_g_a_d_e,
criticising the _p_o_v_e_r_t_y in which many Light Brigade _v_e_t_e_r_a_n_s found themselves
in _o_l_d_ _a_g_e. Instead, the new wave of poetry, from the _w_a_r_ _p_o_e_t_s, was written
from the point of view of the disenchanted _t_r_e_n_c_h soldier.
Leading war poets included _S_i_e_g_f_r_i_e_d_ _S_a_s_s_o_o_n, _W_i_l_f_r_e_d_ _O_w_e_n, _J_o_h_n_ _M_c_C_r_a_e, _R_u_p_e_r_t
_B_r_o_o_k_e, _I_s_a_a_c_ _R_o_s_e_n_b_e_r_g and _D_a_v_i_d_ _J_o_n_e_s. A similar _m_o_v_e_m_e_n_t occurred in
literature, producing a slew of _n_o_v_e_l_s on both sides of the Atlantic including
notably _A_l_l_ _Q_u_i_e_t_ _o_n_ _t_h_e_ _W_e_s_t_e_r_n_ _F_r_o_n_t and _J_o_h_n_n_y_ _G_o_t_ _H_i_s_ _G_u_n. The _1_9_6_3 English
_s_t_a_g_e_ _m_u_s_i_c_a_l _O_h_,_ _W_h_a_t_ _a_ _L_o_v_e_l_y_ _W_a_r_! provided a satirical take on World War I,
which was released in a _c_i_n_e_m_a_t_i_c_ _v_e_r_s_i_o_n directed by _R_i_c_h_a_r_d_ _A_t_t_e_n_b_o_r_o_u_g_h in
1969.
The _p_r_o_p_a_g_a_n_d_a war that accompanied _W_o_r_l_d_ _W_a_r_ _I_I invariably depicted the enemy
in unflattering terms. Examples of this exist not only in posters but also in
the films of _L_e_n_i_ _R_i_e_f_e_n_s_t_a_h_l and _S_e_r_g_e_i_ _E_i_s_e_n_s_t_e_i_n.
Alongside this, World War II also inspired films as varied as _B_r_i_d_g_e_ _o_n_ _t_h_e
_R_i_v_e_r_ _K_w_a_i, _T_h_e_ _L_o_n_g_e_s_t_ _D_a_y, _C_a_t_c_h_-_2_2, _S_a_v_i_n_g_ _P_r_i_v_a_t_e_ _R_y_a_n, and _T_h_e_ _S_e_a_ _S_h_a_l_l
_N_o_t_ _H_a_v_e_ _T_h_e_m. The next major event, the _K_o_r_e_a_n_ _W_a_r inspired a long-running
television series _M_*_A_*_S_*_H. With the _V_i_e_t_n_a_m_ _W_a_r, the tide of balance turned and
its films, notably _A_p_o_c_a_l_y_p_s_e_ _N_o_w, _G_o_o_d_ _M_o_r_n_i_n_g_,_ _V_i_e_t_n_a_m, _G_o_ _T_e_l_l_ _t_h_e_ _S_p_a_r_t_a_n_s,

critical messages.
There is even a _n_u_r_s_e_r_y_ _r_h_y_m_e about war, "_T_h_e_ _G_r_a_n_d_ _O_l_d_ _D_u_k_e_ _o_f_ _Y_o_r_k",
ridiculing a general for his inability to command any further than marching his

Masculinity and perceptions of masculinity plays an important role in the
military. Military organizations form roles and responsibilities that they
expect members to adapt to especially under adverse and life-threatening
conditions. Just like it is used within society, masculinity is a word that is
associated with the military quite often as gender hierarchy exists in relation
to gender subordinated gender constructs._[_1_6_] Studies of masculinity within the
military have been conducted with British servicemen and it was determined that
military forces are masculine institutions and the military culture support
this._[_1_7_] According to soldiers, toughness, endurance, physical prowess and
aggression are requirements to be an effective soldier._[_1_8_] Military cohesion
is created by social rituals which entails almost total subordination to the
group and a sense of depersonalization._[_1_6_] In addition, military culture is
characterized by extremely high levels of social cohesion that is considered
essential to the unit's operational efficiency. ._[_1_6_] This masculine emphasis
separates rather rigidly the male from the female and puts them in conflict
with one another. There have been some attempts of changing this perception
late in the 20th century as women in combat have been portrayed in movies like
"G.I. Jane", "Saving Private Ryan", and "Down Periscope".

Military service offers men unique resources for the construction of a
masculine identity defined by emotional control, overt heterosexual desire,
physical fitness, self-discipline, self-reliance, the willingness to use
aggression and physical violence, and risk taking._[_1_9_] Emotional control is a
very important part of military training and is incorporated into operations.
Training exercises are designed to elicit strong emotions that one may face on
the battle field. Soldiers are taught to control anger, fear, and grief as to
not get in the way of difficult judgments. This type of training creates the
'warrior mindset', but it comes at a cost as it leaves many soldiers without a
healthy way to process emotions and events faced by the battle field._[_1_9_]
Unfortunately, this is believed to be the main cause of the high rate of
suicides amongst soldiers._[_1_6_] This masculine imperative for emotional self-
control places men in a prestigious position and superior to women, since women
are believed to be more emotional than men._[_2_0_] The presence of women in the
military challenges this ideology.

Femininity does have a place within the military, as it does in society,
although to a much lesser extent._[_2_1_] The increased number of women in the
military undeniably signifies a shift in policy. However, current debates
focusing on women's contributions to war efforts only serve to consolidate the
dominant position of military masculinities within the institution. Focusing on
women's difference and women's ability to contribute to strategic military
objectives, they fail to challenge the very nature of the armed forces and
militarism more widely._[_2_1_] Women's role as peace makers and life bearers is
thus constructed in opposition to that of the soldier/combatant. Femininity and
women are therefore excluded from this essentially male and masculine
institution_[_2_1_]
Though women have long served in the Army and currently make up 15% of U.S.
forces in Iraq and Afghanistan and 30% say they served in a combat zone, recent
reports attest to their continued marginalization within Army ranks._[_2_2_] Women
in the military are marginalized because they violate one of the premises of
military indoctrination and the myth of an exclusively male-dominated world. As
a result of their transgression, not only are women excluded from key aspects
of military life, but they are also subjected to violence with great frequency.
_[_2_2_] Recent studies indicate that between 43-60% of female enlisted personnel
experience some form of physical or sexual harassment or violence. This
physical and sexual abuse attests to the exclusion of women within the
military. Recently the pentagon lifted the ban on military women within the
military women in combat roles._[_2_3_]
