MMuussiicc is an _a_r_t form whose _m_e_d_i_u_m is _s_o_u_n_d and silence. Its common elements are
_p_i_t_c_h (which governs _m_e_l_o_d_y and _h_a_r_m_o_n_y), _r_h_y_t_h_m (and its associated concepts
_t_e_m_p_o, _m_e_t_e_r, and _a_r_t_i_c_u_l_a_t_i_o_n), _d_y_n_a_m_i_c_s, and the sonic qualities of _t_i_m_b_r_e
and _t_e_x_t_u_r_e. The word derives from _G_r_e_e_k _Œ_º_Œ_ø_œ_Ö_œ_É_Œ_π_Œ_∫_Œ_Æ (mousike; "art of the
_M_u_s_e_s")._[_1_]
The creation, _p_e_r_f_o_r_m_a_n_c_e, significance, and even the _d_e_f_i_n_i_t_i_o_n_ _o_f_ _m_u_s_i_c vary
according to culture and social context. Music ranges from strictly organized
compositions (and their recreation in performance), through improvisational
music to _a_l_e_a_t_o_r_i_c forms. Music can be divided into _g_e_n_r_e_s and _s_u_b_g_e_n_r_e_s,
although the dividing lines and relationships between music genres are often
subtle, sometimes open to personal interpretation, and occasionally
controversial. Within _t_h_e_ _a_r_t_s, music may be classified as a _p_e_r_f_o_r_m_i_n_g_ _a_r_t, a
_f_i_n_e_ _a_r_t, and auditory art. It may also be divided among _a_r_t_ _m_u_s_i_c and _f_o_l_k
_m_u_s_i_c. There is also a strong connection between _m_u_s_i_c_ _a_n_d_ _m_a_t_h_e_m_a_t_i_c_s._[_2_]
Music may be played and heard live, may be part of a _d_r_a_m_a_t_i_c_ _w_o_r_k or _f_i_l_m, or
may be recorded.
To many people in many cultures, music is an important part of their way of
life. _A_n_c_i_e_n_t_ _G_r_e_e_k and _I_n_d_i_a_n_ _p_h_i_l_o_s_o_p_h_e_r_s defined music as tones ordered
horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as
"the harmony of the spheres" and "it is music to my ears" point to the notion
that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century
composer _J_o_h_n_ _C_a_g_e thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example,
"There is no noise, only sound."_[_3_] Musicologist _J_e_a_n_-_J_a_c_q_u_e_s_ _N_a_t_t_i_e_z
summarizes the relativist, post-modern viewpoint: "The border between music and
noise is always culturally defined‚Äîwhich implies that, even within a single
society, this border does not always pass through the same place; in short,
there is rarely a consensus ... By all accounts there is no single and
intercultural universal concept defining what music might be."_[_4_]

Prehistoric music can only be theorized based on findings from _p_a_l_e_o_l_i_t_h_i_c
archaeology sites. _F_l_u_t_e_s are often discovered, carved from bones in which
lateral holes have been pierced; these are thought to have been blown at one
end like the Japanese _s_h_a_k_u_h_a_c_h_i. The _D_i_v_j_e_ _B_a_b_e_ _f_l_u_t_e, carved from a _c_a_v_e_ _b_e_a_r

music, which _O_s_i_r_i_s in turn used as part of his effort to civilize the world.

musical tradition:"_[_1_6_]
      "While Genesis 4.21 identifies Jubal as the ‚Äúfather of all such as
      handle the harp and pipe,‚Äù the Pentateuch is nearly silent about the
      practice and instruction of music in the early life of Israel. Then, in I
      Samuel 10 and the texts that follow, a curious thing happens. ‚ÄúOne
      finds in the biblical text,‚Äù writes Alfred Sendrey, ‚Äúa sudden and
      unexplained upsurge of large choirs and orchestras, consisting of
      thoroughly organized and trained musical groups, which would be virtually
      inconceivable without lengthy, methodical preparation.‚Äù This has led
      some scholars to believe that the prophet Samuel was the patriarch of a
      school, which taught not only prophets and holy men, but also sacred-rite
      musicians. This public music school, perhaps the earliest in recorded
      history, was not restricted to a priestly class‚Äîwhich is how the
      shepherd boy David appears on the scene as a minstrel to King Saul."_[_1_6_]

Music was an important part of social and cultural life in _A_n_c_i_e_n_t_ _G_r_e_e_c_e.
Musicians and _s_i_n_g_e_r_s played a prominent role in _G_r_e_e_k_ _t_h_e_a_t_e_r._[_1_7_] Mixed-
gender _c_h_o_r_u_s_e_s performed for entertainment, celebration, and spiritual
ceremonies._[_1_8_] Instruments included the double-reed _a_u_l_o_s and a plucked _s_t_r_i_n_g
_i_n_s_t_r_u_m_e_n_t, the _l_y_r_e, principally the special kind called a _k_i_t_h_a_r_a. _M_u_s_i_c was
an important part of education, and boys were taught music starting at age six.
Greek musical literacy created a flowering of music development. Greek _m_u_s_i_c
_t_h_e_o_r_y included the Greek _m_u_s_i_c_a_l_ _m_o_d_e_s, that eventually became the basis for
Western _r_e_l_i_g_i_o_u_s and _c_l_a_s_s_i_c_a_l music. Later, influences from the _R_o_m_a_n_ _E_m_p_i_r_e,
_E_a_s_t_e_r_n_ _E_u_r_o_p_e, and the _B_y_z_a_n_t_i_n_e_ _E_m_p_i_r_e changed Greek music. The _S_e_i_k_i_l_o_s

The _m_e_d_i_e_v_a_l era (476 AD to 1400 AD) started with the introduction of chanting
into _R_o_m_a_n_ _C_a_t_h_o_l_i_c_ _C_h_u_r_c_h services. Western Music then started becoming more
of an art form with the advances in music notation. The only European Medieval
repertory that survives from before about 800 is the _m_o_n_o_p_h_o_n_i_c _l_i_t_u_r_g_i_c_a_l
_p_l_a_i_n_s_o_n_g of the Roman Catholic Church, the central tradition of which was
called _G_r_e_g_o_r_i_a_n_ _c_h_a_n_t. Alongside these traditions of _s_a_c_r_e_d and _c_h_u_r_c_h_ _m_u_s_i_c
there existed a vibrant tradition of _s_e_c_u_l_a_r_ _s_o_n_g. Examples of composers from

Allegory of Music, by _F_i_l_i_p_p_i_n_o_ _L_i_p_p_i
_R_e_n_a_i_s_s_a_n_c_e music (c. 1400 A.D. to 1600 A.D.) was more focused on secular
themes. Around 1450, the _p_r_i_n_t_i_n_g press was invented, and that helped to
disseminate musical styles more quickly and across a larger area. Thus, music
could play an increasingly important role in daily life. Musicians worked for
the church, courts and towns. Church choirs grew in size, and the church
remained an important patron of music. By the middle of the 15th century,
_c_o_m_p_o_s_e_r_s wrote richly polyphonic sacred music. Prominent composers from this
era are _G_u_i_l_l_a_u_m_e_ _D_u_f_a_y, _G_i_o_v_a_n_n_i_ _P_i_e_r_l_u_i_g_i_ _d_a_ _P_a_l_e_s_t_r_i_n_a, _T_h_o_m_a_s_ _M_o_r_l_e_y, and
_O_r_l_a_n_d_e_ _d_e_ _L_a_s_s_u_s. However, musical activity shifted to the courts. Kings and
princes competed for the finest composers.
Many leading important composers came from Holland, Belgium, and northern
France and are called the Franco-Flemish composers. They held important
positions throughout Europe, especially in Italy. Other countries with vibrant
musical lives include Germany, England, and Spain.

The _B_a_r_o_q_u_e_ _e_r_a_ _o_f_ _m_u_s_i_c took place from 1600 to 1750, as the _B_a_r_o_q_u_e_ _a_r_t_i_s_t_i_c
_s_t_y_l_e flourished across Europe; and during this time, music expanded in its
range and complexity. Baroque music began when the first _o_p_e_r_a_s were written
and when _c_o_n_t_r_a_p_u_n_t_a_l music became prevalent. German Baroque composers wrote
for small _e_n_s_e_m_b_l_e_s including strings, _b_r_a_s_s, and _w_o_o_d_w_i_n_d_s, as well as _c_h_o_i_r_s,
_p_i_p_e_ _o_r_g_a_n, _h_a_r_p_s_i_c_h_o_r_d, and _c_l_a_v_i_c_h_o_r_d. During this period several major music
forms were defined that lasted into later periods when they were expanded and
evolved further, including the _f_u_g_u_e, the _i_n_v_e_n_t_i_o_n, the _s_o_n_a_t_a, and the
_c_o_n_c_e_r_t_o._[_1_9_] The late Baroque style was polyphonically complex and ornamental
and rich in its melodies. Composers from the Baroque era include _J_o_h_a_n_n
_S_e_b_a_s_t_i_a_n_ _B_a_c_h, _G_e_o_r_g_e_ _F_r_i_d_e_r_i_c_ _H_a_n_d_e_l, and _G_e_o_r_g_ _P_h_i_l_i_p_p_ _T_e_l_e_m_a_n_n.

The music of the _C_l_a_s_s_i_c_a_l_ _P_e_r_i_o_d (1750 A.D. to 1830 A.D.) looked to the art
and philosophy of Ancient Greece and Rome, to the ideals of balance, proportion
and disciplined expression. It has a lighter, clearer and considerably simpler
texture, and tended to be almost voicelike and singable. New genres were
discovered. The main style was the _h_o_m_o_p_h_o_n_y,_[_2_0_] where prominent _m_e_l_o_d_y and
_a_c_c_o_m_p_a_n_i_m_e_n_t are clearly distinct.
Importance was given to _i_n_s_t_r_u_m_e_n_t_a_l music. It was dominated by further
evolution of musical forms initially defined in the Baroque period: the _s_o_n_a_t_a,
the _c_o_n_c_e_r_t_o, and the _s_y_m_p_h_o_n_y. Others main kinds were _t_r_i_o, _s_t_r_i_n_g_ _q_u_a_r_t_e_t,
_s_e_r_e_n_a_d_e and _d_i_v_e_r_t_i_m_e_n_t_o. The sonata was the most important and developed
form. Although Baroque composers also wrote sonatas, the Classical style of
sonata is completely distinct. All of the main instrumental forms of the
Classical era were based on the dramatic structure of the sonata.
One of the most important evolutionary steps made in the Classical period was
the development of public concerts. The aristocracy would still play a
significant role in the sponsorship of musical life, but it was now possible
for composers to survive without being its permanent employees. The increasing
popularity led to a growth in both the number and range of the orchestras. The
expansion of orchestral concerts necessitated large public spaces. As a result
of all these processes, symphonic music (including _o_p_e_r_a, _b_a_l_l_e_t and _o_r_a_t_o_r_i_o)
became more extroverted.
The best known composers of Classicism are _C_a_r_l_ _P_h_i_l_i_p_p_ _E_m_a_n_u_e_l_ _B_a_c_h, _C_h_r_i_s_t_o_p_h

considered to be composers in evolution towards Romanticism.

_R_o_m_a_n_t_i_c_ _M_u_s_i_c (c. 1810 A.D. to 1900 A.D.) turned the rigid styles and forms of
the Classical era into more passionate and expressive pieces. It attempted to
increase emotional expression and power to describe deeper truths or human
feelings. The emotional and expressive qualities of music came to take
precedence over technique and tradition. Romantic composers grew in
idiosyncrasy, and went further in the syncretism of different art-forms (such
as literature), history (historical figures), or nature itself with music.
Romantic love was a prevalent theme in many works composed during this period.
In some cases the formal structures from the classical period were preserved,
but in many others existing genres, forms, and functions were improved. Also,
new forms were created that were deemed better suited to the new subject
matter. _O_p_e_r_a and _b_a_l_l_e_t continued to evolve._[_1_7_]
In 1800, the music developed by _L_u_d_w_i_g_ _v_a_n_ _B_e_e_t_h_o_v_e_n and _F_r_a_n_z_ _S_c_h_u_b_e_r_t
introduced a more dramatic, expressive style. In Beethoven's case, _m_o_t_i_f_s,
developed organically, came to replace _m_e_l_o_d_y as the most significant
compositional unit. Later Romantic composers such as _P_y_o_t_r_ _I_l_y_i_c_h_ _T_c_h_a_i_k_o_v_s_k_y,
_A_n_t_o_n_√_≠_n_ _D_v_o_≈_ô_√_°_k, and _G_u_s_t_a_v_ _M_a_h_l_e_r used more elaborated _c_h_o_r_d_s and more
_d_i_s_s_o_n_a_n_c_e to create dramatic tension. They generated complex and often much
longer musical works. During Romantic period _t_o_n_a_l_i_t_y was at its peak. The late
19th century saw a dramatic expansion in the size of the _o_r_c_h_e_s_t_r_a, and in the

Performance is the physical expression of music. Often, a musical work is
performed once its structure and instrumentation are satisfactory to its
creators; however, as it gets performed, it can evolve and change. A
performance can either be rehearsed or _i_m_p_r_o_v_i_s_e_d. Improvisation is a musical
idea created without premeditation, while rehearsal is vigorous repetition of
an idea until it has achieved cohesion. _M_u_s_i_c_i_a_n_s will sometimes add
improvisation to a well-rehearsed idea to create a unique performance.
Many cultures include strong traditions of _s_o_l_o and performance, such as in
Indian classical music, and in the Western art-music tradition. Other cultures,
such as in _B_a_l_i, include strong traditions of group performance. All cultures
include a mixture of both, and performance may range from improvised solo
playing for one's enjoyment to highly planned and organised performance rituals
such as the modern classical concert, religious processions, _m_u_s_i_c_ _f_e_s_t_i_v_a_l_s or
_m_u_s_i_c_ _c_o_m_p_e_t_i_t_i_o_n_s. _C_h_a_m_b_e_r_ _m_u_s_i_c, which is music for a small ensemble with
only a few of each type of instrument, is often seen as more intimate than
symphonic works.

Many types of music, such as traditional _b_l_u_e_s and _f_o_l_k_ _m_u_s_i_c were originally
preserved in the memory of performers, and the songs were handed down _o_r_a_l_l_y,
or aurally (by ear). When the composer of music is no longer known, this music
is often classified as "traditional." Different musical traditions have
different attitudes towards how and where to make changes to the original
source material, from quite strict, to those that demand improvisation or
modification to the music. A culture's history may also be passed by ear
through song.

The detail included explicitly in the _m_u_s_i_c_ _n_o_t_a_t_i_o_n varies between genres and
historical periods. In general, art music notation from the 17th through the
19th century required performers to have a great deal of contextual knowledge
about performing styles. For example, in the 17th and 18th century, music
notated for solo performers typically indicated a simple, unadorned melody.
However, performers were expected to know how to add stylistically appropriate
ornaments, such as _t_r_i_l_l_s and _t_u_r_n_s. In the 19th century, art music for solo
performers may give a general instruction such as to perform the music
expressively, without describing in detail how the performer should do this.
The performer was expected to know how to use tempo changes, _a_c_c_e_n_t_u_a_t_i_o_n, and
_p_a_u_s_e_s (among other devices) to obtain this "expressive" performance style. In
the 20th century, art music notation often became more explicit and used a
range of markings and annotations to indicate to performers how they should
play or sing the piece.
In _p_o_p_u_l_a_r_ _m_u_s_i_c and jazz, music notation almost always indicates only the
basic framework of the melody, harmony, or performance approach; musicians and
singers are expected to know the performance conventions and styles associated
with specific genres and pieces. For example, the "_l_e_a_d_ _s_h_e_e_t" for a jazz tune
may only indicate the melody and the chord changes. The performers in the _j_a_z_z
_e_n_s_e_m_b_l_e are expected to know how to "flesh out" this basic structure by adding
ornaments, improvised music, and chordal accompaniment.

Music is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from aesthetic
pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes, or as an _e_n_t_e_r_t_a_i_n_m_e_n_t product for
the marketplace. Amateur musicians compose and perform music for their own
pleasure, and they do not derive their income from music. Professional
musicians are employed by a range of institutions and organisations, including
armed forces, churches and synagogues, symphony orchestras, _b_r_o_a_d_c_a_s_t_i_n_g or
_f_i_l_m_ _p_r_o_d_u_c_t_i_o_n companies, and _m_u_s_i_c_ _s_c_h_o_o_l_s. Professional musicians sometimes
work as freelancers, seeking contracts and engagements in a variety of
settings.
There are often many links between amateur and professional musicians.
Beginning amateur musicians take _l_e_s_s_o_n_s with professional musicians. In
community settings, advanced amateur musicians perform with professional
musicians in a variety of ensembles and orchestras. In some cases, amateur
musicians attain a professional level of competence, and they are able to
perform in professional performance settings. A distinction is often made
between music performed for the benefit of a live audience and music that is
performed for the purpose of being recorded and distributed through the music
retail system or the broadcasting system. However, there are also many cases
where a live performance in front of an audience is recorded and distributed
(or broadcast).

An old songbook showing a composition
"Composition" is often classed as the creation and recording of music via a
medium by which others can interpret it (i.e., paper or sound). Many cultures
use at least part of the concept of preconceiving musical material, or
composition, as held in western _c_l_a_s_s_i_c_a_l_ _m_u_s_i_c. Even when music is notated
precisely, there are still many decisions that a performer has to make. The
process of a performer deciding how to perform music that has been previously
composed and notated is termed interpretation. Different performers'
interpretations of the same music can vary widely. Composers and song writers
who present their own music are interpreting, just as much as those who perform
the music of others or folk music. The standard body of choices and techniques
present at a given time and a given place is referred to as _p_e_r_f_o_r_m_a_n_c_e
_p_r_a_c_t_i_c_e, whereas interpretation is generally used to mean either individual
choices of a performer, or an aspect of music that is not clear, and therefore
has a "standard" interpretation.
In some musical genres, such as jazz and blues, even more freedom is given to
the performer to engage in improvisation on a basic melodic, harmonic, or
rhythmic framework. The greatest latitude is given to the performer in a style
of performing called _f_r_e_e_ _i_m_p_r_o_v_i_s_a_t_i_o_n, which is material that is
spontaneously "thought of" (imagined) while being performed, not preconceived.
Improvised music usually follows stylistic or genre conventions and even "fully
composed" includes some _f_r_e_e_l_y_ _c_h_o_s_e_n_ _m_a_t_e_r_i_a_l. Composition does not always
mean the use of notation, or the known sole authorship of one individual. Music
can also be determined by describing a "process" that creates musical sounds.
Examples of this range from wind chimes, through computer programs that select
sounds. Music from random elements is called _A_l_e_a_t_o_r_i_c_ _m_u_s_i_c, and is associated
with such composers as John Cage, _M_o_r_t_o_n_ _F_e_l_d_m_a_n, and _W_i_t_o_l_d_ _L_u_t_o_s_≈_Ç_a_w_s_k_i.
Music can be composed for repeated performance or it can be improvised:
composed on the spot. The music can be performed entirely from memory, from a
written system of musical notation, or some combination of both. Study of
composition has traditionally been dominated by examination of methods and
practice of Western classical music, but the definition of composition is broad
enough to include spontaneously improvised works like those of _f_r_e_e_ _j_a_z_z
performers and African drummers such as the _E_w_e_ _d_r_u_m_m_e_r_s.

Notation is the written expression of music notes and rhythms on paper using
symbols. When music is written down, the pitches and rhythm of the music is
notated, along with instructions on how to perform the music. The study of how
to read notation involves music theory, harmony, the study of performance
practice, and in some cases an understanding of historical performance methods.
Written notation varies with style and period of music. In Western Art music,
the most common types of written notation are scores, which include all the
music parts of an ensemble piece, and parts, which are the music notation for
the individual performers or singers. In popular music, jazz, and blues, the
standard musical notation is the lead sheet, which notates the melody, chords,
_l_y_r_i_c_s (if it is a vocal piece), and structure of the music. Scores and parts
are also used in popular music and jazz, particularly in large ensembles such
as jazz "big bands."
In popular music, _g_u_i_t_a_r_i_s_t_s and electric _b_a_s_s players often read music notated
in tablature (often abbreviated as "tab"), which indicates the location of the
notes to be played on the instrument using a diagram of the guitar or bass
fingerboard. Tabulature was also used in the Baroque era to notate music for
the _l_u_t_e, a stringed, fretted instrument. Notated music is produced as _s_h_e_e_t
_m_u_s_i_c. To perform music from notation requires an understanding of both the
rhythmic and pitch elements embodied in the symbols and the performance
practice that is associated with a piece of music or a genre. In improvisation,
the performer often plays from music where only the chord changes are written,
requiring a great understanding of the music's structure and _c_h_o_r_d

often considered an act of instantaneous composition by performers, where
compositional techniques are employed with or without preparation.
Improvisation is a major part of some types of music, such as _b_l_u_e_s, _j_a_z_z, and
_j_a_z_z_ _f_u_s_i_o_n, in which instrumental performers improvise solos and melody lines.
In the Western art music tradition, improvisation was an important skill during
the Baroque era and during the Classical era; solo performers and singers
improvised virtuoso cadenzas during concerts. However, in the 20th and 21st
century, improvisation played a smaller role in _W_e_s_t_e_r_n_ _A_r_t_ _m_u_s_i_c_.

Music theory encompasses the nature and mechanics of music. It often involves
identifying patterns that govern composers' techniques and examining the
_l_a_n_g_u_a_g_e and _n_o_t_a_t_i_o_n of music. In a grand sense, music theory distills and
analyzes the _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r_s or elements of music ‚Äì _r_h_y_t_h_m, _h_a_r_m_o_n_y (_h_a_r_m_o_n_i_c

include any statement, belief, or conception of or about music._[_2_5_] People who
study these properties are known as music theorists. Some have applied
_a_c_o_u_s_t_i_c_s, _h_u_m_a_n_ _p_h_y_s_i_o_l_o_g_y, and _p_s_y_c_h_o_l_o_g_y to the explanation of how and why
music is _p_e_r_c_e_i_v_e_d. Music has many different fundamentals or elements. These
are, but are not limited to: pitch, beat or pulse, rhythm, melody, harmony,
texture, allocation of voices, timbre or color, expressive qualities (dynamics
and articulation), and form or structure.
Pitch is a subjective sensation, reflecting generally the lowness or highness
of a sound. _R_h_y_t_h_m is the arrangement of sounds and silences in _t_i_m_e. _M_e_t_e_r
animates time in regular pulse groupings, called _m_e_a_s_u_r_e_s_ _o_r_ _b_a_r_s. A melody is
a series of notes sounding in succession. The notes of a melody are typically
created with respect to pitch systems such as _s_c_a_l_e_s or _m_o_d_e_s. _H_a_r_m_o_n_y is the
study of vertical sonorities in music. Vertical sonority refers to considering
the relationships between pitches that occur together; usually this means at
the same time, although harmony can also be implied by a melody that outlines a
harmonic structure. Notes can be arranged into different _s_c_a_l_e_s and _m_o_d_e_s.
Western music theory generally divides the octave into a series of 12 notes
that might be included in a piece of music. In music written using the system
of major-minor _t_o_n_a_l_i_t_y, the kkeeyy of a piece determines the scale used. _M_u_s_i_c_a_l
_t_e_x_t_u_r_e is the overall sound of a piece of music commonly described according
to the number of and relationship between parts or lines of music: _m_o_n_o_p_h_o_n_y,
_h_e_t_e_r_o_p_h_o_n_y, _p_o_l_y_p_h_o_n_y, _h_o_m_o_p_h_o_n_y, or _m_o_n_o_d_y.
Timbre, sometimes called "Color" or "Tone Color" is the quality or sound of a
voice or instrument._[_2_6_] Expressive Qualities are those elements in music that
create change in music that are not related to pitch, rhythm or timbre. They
include Dynamics and Articulation. _F_o_r_m is a facet of music theory that
explores the concept of musical syntax, on a local and global level. Examples
of common forms of Western music include the _f_u_g_u_e, the _i_n_v_e_n_t_i_o_n, _s_o_n_a_t_a_-

Philosophy of music is the study of fundamental questions regarding music. The
philosophical study of music has many connections with philosophical questions
in _m_e_t_a_p_h_y_s_i_c_s and _a_e_s_t_h_e_t_i_c_s. Some basic questions in the philosophy of music
are:
    * What is the definition of music? (What are the _n_e_c_e_s_s_a_r_y_ _a_n_d_ _s_u_f_f_i_c_i_e_n_t
      _c_o_n_d_i_t_i_o_n_s for classifying something as music?)
    * What is the relationship between music and mind?
    * What does musical history reveal to us about the world?
    * What is the connection between music and emotions?
    * What is meaning in relation to music?
Traditionally, the aesthetics of music explored the mathematical and
cosmological dimensions of rhythmic and harmonic organization. In the
eighteenth century, focus shifted to the experience of hearing music, and thus
to questions about its beauty and human enjoyment (_p_l_a_i_s_i_r and _j_o_u_i_s_s_a_n_c_e) of
music. The origin of this philosophic shift is sometimes attributed to
_B_a_u_m_g_a_r_t_e_n in the 18th century, followed by _K_a_n_t. Through their writing, the
ancient term 'aesthetics', meaning sensory perception, received its present day
connotation. In recent decades philosophers have tended to emphasize issues
besides beauty and enjoyment. For example, music's capacity to express emotion
has been a central issue.
In the 20th century, important contributions were made by _P_e_t_e_r_ _K_i_v_y, _J_e_r_r_o_l_d
_L_e_v_i_n_s_o_n, _R_o_g_e_r_ _S_c_r_u_t_o_n, and _S_t_e_p_h_e_n_ _D_a_v_i_e_s. However, many musicians, _m_u_s_i_c
_c_r_i_t_i_c_s, and other non-philosophers have contributed to the aesthetics of
music. In the 19th century, a significant debate arose between _E_d_u_a_r_d_ _H_a_n_s_l_i_c_k,
a music critic and musicologist, and composer _R_i_c_h_a_r_d_ _W_a_g_n_e_r. _H_a_r_r_y_ _P_a_r_t_c_h and
some other _m_u_s_i_c_o_l_o_g_i_s_t_s, such as _K_y_l_e_ _G_a_n_n, have studied and tried to
popularize _m_i_c_r_o_t_o_n_a_l_ _m_u_s_i_c and the usage of alternate _m_u_s_i_c_a_l_ _s_c_a_l_e_s. Also
many modern composers like _L_a_m_o_n_t_e_ _Y_o_u_n_g, _R_h_y_s_ _C_h_a_t_h_a_m and _G_l_e_n_n_ _B_r_a_n_c_a paid
much attention to a scale called _j_u_s_t_ _i_n_t_o_n_a_t_i_o_n.
It is often thought that music has the ability to affect our _e_m_o_t_i_o_n_s,
_i_n_t_e_l_l_e_c_t, and _p_s_y_c_h_o_l_o_g_y; it can assuage our loneliness or incite our
passions. The philosopher _P_l_a_t_o suggests in the Republic that music has a
direct effect on the soul. Therefore, he proposes that in the ideal regime
music would be closely regulated by the state. (Book VII)
There has been a strong tendency in the aesthetics of music to emphasize the
paramount importance of compositional structure; however, other issues
concerning the aesthetics of music include _l_y_r_i_c_i_s_m, _h_a_r_m_o_n_y, _h_y_p_n_o_t_i_s_m,

The field of music cognition involves the study of many aspects of music,
including how it is processed by listeners. Rather than accepting the standard
practices of analyzing, composing, and performing music as a given, much
research in music cognition seeks instead to uncover the mental processes that
underlie these practices. Also, research in the field seeks to uncover
commonalities between the musical traditions of disparate cultures and possible
cognitive "constraints" that limit these musical systems. Questions regarding
musical innateness, and emotional responses to music are also major areas of
research in the field.
_D_e_a_f people can experience music by feeling the vibrations in their body, a
process that can be enhanced if the individual holds a resonant, hollow object.
A well-known deaf musician is the composer _L_u_d_w_i_g_ _v_a_n_ _B_e_e_t_h_o_v_e_n, who composed
many famous works even after he had completely lost his hearing. Recent
examples of deaf musicians include _E_v_e_l_y_n_ _G_l_e_n_n_i_e, a highly acclaimed
_p_e_r_c_u_s_s_i_o_n_i_s_t who has been deaf since age twelve, and _C_h_r_i_s_ _B_u_c_k, a virtuoso
_v_i_o_l_i_n_i_s_t who has lost his hearing. This is relevant because it indicates that
music is a deeper cognitive process than unexamined phrases such as, "pleasing
to the ear" suggests. Much research in music cognition seeks to uncover these
complex mental processes involved in listening to music, which may seem
intuitively simple, yet are vastly intricate and complex.

Cognitive neuroscience of music is the scientific study of brain-based
mechanisms involved in the cognitive processes underlying music. These
behaviours include music listening, performing, composing, reading, writing,
and ancillary activities. It also is increasingly concerned with the brain
basis for musical aesthetics and musical emotion. Scientists working in this
field may have training in cognitive neuroscience, neurology, neuroanatomy,
psychology, music theory, computer science, and other allied fields.

Biomusicology is the study of music from a biological point of view. The term
was coined by Nils L. Wallin in 1991._[_3_2_] Music is an aspect of the behaviour
of the human and possibly other species. As humans are living organisms, the
scientific study of music is therefore part of _b_i_o_l_o_g_y, thus the "bio" in
"biomusicology."
Biomusicologists are expected to have completed formal studies in both biology
or other experimental sciences and musicology including _m_u_s_i_c_ _t_h_e_o_r_y. The three

music, the question of animal song, selection pressures underlying music
evolution", and "music evolution and human evolution". Neuromusicology studies
the "brain areas involved in music processing, neural and cognitive processes
of musical processing," and "ontogeny of musical capacity and musical skill".
Comparative musicology studies the "functions and uses of music, advantages and
costs of music making", and "universal features of musical systems and musical
behavior."_[_3_3_]

  This Song Dynasty (960‚Äì1279) painting, entitled the "Night Revels of Han

Music is experienced by individuals in a range of social settings ranging from
being alone to attending a large concert. Musical performances take different
forms in different cultures and socioeconomic milieus. In Europe and North
America, there is often a divide between what types of music are viewed as a
"_h_i_g_h_ _c_u_l_t_u_r_e" and "_l_o_w_ _c_u_l_t_u_r_e." "High culture" types of music typically
include Western art music such as Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and modern-era
symphonies, concertos, and solo works, and are typically heard in formal
concerts in concert halls and churches, with the audience sitting quietly in
seats.
Other types of music‚Äîincluding, but not limited to, jazz, blues, _s_o_u_l, and
_c_o_u_n_t_r_y‚Äîare often performed in bars, nightclubs, and theatres, where the
audience may be able to drink, dance, and express themselves by cheering. Until
the later 20th century, the division between "high" and "low" musical forms was
widely accepted as a valid distinction that separated out better quality, more
advanced "art music" from the popular styles of music heard in bars and dance
halls.
However, in the 1980s and 1990s, musicologists studying this perceived divide
between "high" and "low" musical genres argued that this distinction is not
based on the musical value or quality of the different types of music.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n
_n_e_e_d_e_d] Rather, they argued that this distinction was based largely on the
_s_o_c_i_o_e_c_o_n_o_m_i_c_s standing or _s_o_c_i_a_l_ _c_l_a_s_s of the performers or audience of the
different types of music.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] For example, whereas the audience
for Classical symphony concerts typically have above-average incomes, the
audience for a rap concert in an inner-city area may have below-average
incomes.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] Even though the performers, audience, or venue where
non-"art" music is performed may have a lower socioeconomic status, the music
that is performed, such as blues, rap, _p_u_n_k, _f_u_n_k, or _s_k_a may be very complex
and sophisticated.
When composers introduce styles of music that break with convention, there can
be a strong resistance from academic music experts and popular culture. Late-
period Beethoven string quartets, Stravinsky _b_a_l_l_e_t scores, _s_e_r_i_a_l_i_s_m, _b_e_b_o_p-
era jazz, hip hop, punk rock, and _e_l_e_c_t_r_o_n_i_c_a have all been considered non-
music by some critics when they were first introduced.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] Such
themes are examined in the _s_o_c_i_o_l_o_g_y of music. The sociological study of music,
sometimes called _s_o_c_i_o_m_u_s_i_c_o_l_o_g_y, is often pursued in departments of sociology,
media studies, or music, and is closely related to the field of
_e_t_h_n_o_m_u_s_i_c_o_l_o_g_y.

The music that composers make can be heard through several _m_e_d_i_a; the most
traditional way is to hear it live, in the presence of the musicians (or as one
of the musicians), in an outdoor or indoor space such as an amphitheatre,
_c_o_n_c_e_r_t_ _h_a_l_l, _c_a_b_a_r_e_t room or _t_h_e_a_t_r_e. Live music can also be broadcast over
the _r_a_d_i_o, _t_e_l_e_v_i_s_i_o_n or the _I_n_t_e_r_n_e_t. Some musical styles focus on producing a
sound for a performance, while others focus on producing a recording that mixes
together sounds that were never played "live." Recording, even of essentially
live styles, often uses the ability to edit and splice to produce recordings
considered better than the actual performance.
As _t_a_l_k_i_n_g_ _p_i_c_t_u_r_e_s emerged in the early 20th century, with their prerecorded
musical tracks, an increasing number of moviehouse orchestra musicians found
themselves out of work._[_3_4_] During the 1920s live musical performances by
orchestras, _p_i_a_n_i_s_t_s, and _t_h_e_a_t_e_r_ _o_r_g_a_n_i_s_t_s were common at first-run theaters.
_[_3_5_] With the coming of the talking motion pictures, those featured
performances were largely eliminated. The _A_m_e_r_i_c_a_n_ _F_e_d_e_r_a_t_i_o_n_ _o_f_ _M_u_s_i_c_i_a_n_s

musicians with mechanical playing devices. One 1929 ad that appeared in the
_P_i_t_t_s_b_u_r_g_h_ _P_r_e_s_s features an image of a can labeled "Canned Music / Big Noise

also become more accessible through computers, devices and Internet in a form
that is commonly known as _M_u_s_i_c_-_O_n_-_D_e_m_a_n_d.
In many cultures, there is less distinction between performing and listening to
music, since virtually everyone is involved in some sort of musical activity,
often communal. In industrialized countries, listening to music through a
recorded form, such as _s_o_u_n_d_ _r_e_c_o_r_d_i_n_g or watching a _m_u_s_i_c_ _v_i_d_e_o, became more
common than experiencing live performance, roughly in the middle of the 20th
century.
Sometimes, live performances incorporate prerecorded sounds. For example, a
_d_i_s_c_ _j_o_c_k_e_y uses _d_i_s_c_ _r_e_c_o_r_d_s for _s_c_r_a_t_c_h_i_n_g, and some 20th-century works have
a solo for an instrument or voice that is performed along with music that is
prerecorded onto a tape. _C_o_m_p_u_t_e_r_s and many _k_e_y_b_o_a_r_d_s can be programmed to
produce and play _M_u_s_i_c_a_l_ _I_n_s_t_r_u_m_e_n_t_ _D_i_g_i_t_a_l_ _I_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e (MIDI) music. Audiences
can also become performers by participating in _k_a_r_a_o_k_e, an activity of Japanese
origin centered on a device that plays voice-eliminated versions of well-known
songs. Most karaoke machines also have video screens that show lyrics to songs
being performed; performers can follow the lyrics as they sing over the
instrumental tracks.

The advent of the _I_n_t_e_r_n_e_t has transformed the experience of music, partly
through the increased ease of access to music and the increased choice. _C_h_r_i_s
_A_n_d_e_r_s_o_n, in his book The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business is Selling Less
of More, suggests that while the economic model of _s_u_p_p_l_y_ _a_n_d_ _d_e_m_a_n_d describes
scarcity, the Internet retail model is based on abundance. _D_i_g_i_t_a_l_ _s_t_o_r_a_g_e
costs are low, so a company can afford to make its whole inventory available
online, giving customers as much choice as possible. It has thus become
economically viable to offer products that very few people are interested in.
Consumers' growing awareness of their increased choice results in a closer
association between listening tastes and social identity, and the creation of
thousands of _n_i_c_h_e_ _m_a_r_k_e_t_s._[_3_7_]
Another effect of the Internet arises with _o_n_l_i_n_e_ _c_o_m_m_u_n_i_t_i_e_s like _Y_o_u_T_u_b_e and
_F_a_c_e_b_o_o_k, a _s_o_c_i_a_l_ _n_e_t_w_o_r_k_i_n_g_ _s_e_r_v_i_c_e. Such sites simplify connecting with
other musicians, and greatly facilitate the distribution of music. Professional
musicians also use YouTube as a free publisher of promotional material. YouTube
users, for example, no longer only download and listen to _M_P_3_s, but also
actively create their own. According to _D_o_n_ _T_a_p_s_c_o_t_t and _A_n_t_h_o_n_y_ _D_._ _W_i_l_l_i_a_m_s,
in their book _W_i_k_i_n_o_m_i_c_s, there has been a shift from a traditional consumer
role to what they call a "_p_r_o_s_u_m_e_r" role, a consumer who both creates and
consumes. Manifestations of this in music include the production of _m_a_s_h_e_s,
_r_e_m_i_x_e_s, and music videos by fans._[_3_8_]

The music industry refers to the business industry connected with the creation
and sale of music. It consists of record companies, _l_a_b_e_l_s and _p_u_b_l_i_s_h_e_r_s that
distribute recorded music products internationally and that often control the
rights to those products. Some music labels are "_i_n_d_e_p_e_n_d_e_n_t," while others are
subsidiaries of larger corporate entities or international _m_e_d_i_a_ _g_r_o_u_p_s. In the
2000s, the increasing popularity of listening to music as digital music files
on MP3 players, iPods, or computers, and of trading music on file sharing sites
or buying it online in the form of digital files had a major impact on the
traditional music business. Many smaller independent CD stores went out of
business as music buyers decreased their purchases of CDs, and many labels had
lower CD sales. Some companies did well with the change to a digital format,
though, such as Apple's _i_T_u_n_e_s, an online store that sells digital files of
songs over the Internet.

is common in North America and Europe. Involvement in music is thought to teach
basic skills such as concentration, _c_o_u_n_t_i_n_g, listening, and _c_o_o_p_e_r_a_t_i_o_n while
also promoting understanding of _l_a_n_g_u_a_g_e, improving the ability to _r_e_c_a_l_l
information, and creating an environment more conducive to learning in other
areas._[_3_9_] In _e_l_e_m_e_n_t_a_r_y_ _s_c_h_o_o_l_s, children often learn to play instruments such
as the _r_e_c_o_r_d_e_r, sing in small choirs, and learn about the history of Western
art music. In secondary schools students may have the opportunity to perform
some type of musical ensembles, such as choirs, _m_a_r_c_h_i_n_g_ _b_a_n_d_s, _c_o_n_c_e_r_t_ _b_a_n_d_s,
jazz bands, or orchestras, and in some school systems, music classes may be
available. Some students also take private _m_u_s_i_c_ _l_e_s_s_o_n_s with a teacher.
Amateur musicians typically take lessons to learn musical rudiments and
beginner- to intermediate-level musical techniques.
At the _u_n_i_v_e_r_s_i_t_y level, students in most arts and _h_u_m_a_n_i_t_i_e_s programs can
receive _c_r_e_d_i_t for taking music courses, which typically take the form of an
overview course on the _h_i_s_t_o_r_y_ _o_f_ _m_u_s_i_c, or a _m_u_s_i_c_ _a_p_p_r_e_c_i_a_t_i_o_n course that
focuses on listening to music and learning about different musical styles. In
addition, most North American and European universities have some type of
musical ensembles that non-music students are able to participate in, such as
choirs, marching bands, or orchestras. The study of Western art music is
increasingly common outside of North America and Europe, such as the _I_n_d_o_n_e_s_i_a_n

that are available in Asian countries such as South Korea, Japan, and China. At
the same time, Western universities and colleges are widening their curriculum
to include music of non-Western cultures, such as the _m_u_s_i_c_ _o_f_ _A_f_r_i_c_a or Bali

_M_u_s_i_c_o_l_o_g_y is the study of the subject of music. The earliest definitions
defined three sub-disciplines: _s_y_s_t_e_m_a_t_i_c_ _m_u_s_i_c_o_l_o_g_y, _h_i_s_t_o_r_i_c_a_l_ _m_u_s_i_c_o_l_o_g_y,
and comparative musicology or _e_t_h_n_o_m_u_s_i_c_o_l_o_g_y. In contemporary scholarship, one
is more likely to encounter a division of the discipline into music theory,
music history, and ethnomusicology. Research in musicology has often been
enriched by cross-disciplinary work, for example in the field of
_p_s_y_c_h_o_a_c_o_u_s_t_i_c_s. The study of music of non-western cultures, and the cultural
study of music, is called ethnomusicology. Students can pursue the
undergraduate study of musicology, ethnomusicology, _m_u_s_i_c_ _h_i_s_t_o_r_y, and music
theory through several different types of degrees, including a _B_._M_u_s, a B.A.
with concentration in music, a B.A. with Honors in Music, or a B.A. in Music
History and Literature. Graduates of undergraduate music programs can go on to
further study in music graduate programs.
Graduate degrees include the _M_a_s_t_e_r_ _o_f_ _M_u_s_i_c, the _M_a_s_t_e_r_ _o_f_ _A_r_t_s, the _D_o_c_t_o_r_ _o_f
_P_h_i_l_o_s_o_p_h_y (PhD) (e.g., in musicology or music theory), and more recently, the
_D_o_c_t_o_r_ _o_f_ _M_u_s_i_c_a_l_ _A_r_t_s, or DMA. The Master of Music degree, which takes one to
two years to complete, is typically awarded to students studying the
performance of an instrument, education, voice or composition. The Master of
Arts degree, which takes one to two years to complete and often requires a
_t_h_e_s_i_s, is typically awarded to students studying musicology, music history, or
music theory. _U_n_d_e_r_g_r_a_d_u_a_t_e _u_n_i_v_e_r_s_i_t_y_ _d_e_g_r_e_e_s in music, including the _B_a_c_h_e_l_o_r
_o_f_ _M_u_s_i_c, the Bachelor of Music Education, and the _B_a_c_h_e_l_o_r_ _o_f_ _A_r_t_s (with a
major in music) typically take three to five years to complete. These degrees
provide students with a grounding in music theory and music history, and many
students also study an instrument or learn singing technique as part of their
program.
The PhD, which is required for students who want to work as university
professors in musicology, music history, or music theory, takes three to five
years of study after the Master's degree, during which time the student will
complete advanced courses and undertake research for a dissertation. The DMA is
a relatively new degree that was created to provide a credential for
professional performers or composers that want to work as university professors
in musical performance or composition. The DMA takes three to five years after
a Master's degree, and includes advanced courses, projects, and performances.
In Medieval times, the study of music was one of the _Q_u_a_d_r_i_v_i_u_m of the seven
_L_i_b_e_r_a_l_ _A_r_t_s and considered vital to higher learning. Within the quantitative
Quadrivium, music, or more accurately _h_a_r_m_o_n_i_c_s, was the study of rational
proportions.
_Z_o_o_m_u_s_i_c_o_l_o_g_y is the study of the music of non-human animals, or the musical
aspects of sounds produced by non-human animals. As _G_e_o_r_g_e_ _H_e_r_z_o_g (1941) asked,
"do animals have music?" _F_r_a_n_√_ß_o_i_s_-_B_e_r_n_a_r_d_ _M_√_¢_c_h_e's Musique, mythe, nature, ou

_a_n_a_l_y_s_i_s, shows that _b_i_r_d_ _s_o_n_g_s are organised according to a repetition-
transformation principle. Jean-Jacques Nattiez (1990), argues that "in the last
analysis, it is a human being who decides what is and is not musical, even when
the sound is not of human origin. If we acknowledge that sound is not organised
and conceptualised (that is, made to form music) merely by its producer, but by
the mind that perceives it, then music is uniquely human."
Music theory is the study of music, generally in a highly technical manner
outside of other disciplines. More broadly it refers to any study of music,
usually related in some form with compositional concerns, and may include
_m_a_t_h_e_m_a_t_i_c_s, _p_h_y_s_i_c_s, and _a_n_t_h_r_o_p_o_l_o_g_y. What is most commonly taught in
beginning music theory classes are guidelines to write in the style of the
_c_o_m_m_o_n_ _p_r_a_c_t_i_c_e_ _p_e_r_i_o_d, or _t_o_n_a_l_ _m_u_s_i_c. Theory, even of music of the common
practice period, may take many other forms. _M_u_s_i_c_a_l_ _s_e_t_ _t_h_e_o_r_y is the
application of mathematical _s_e_t_ _t_h_e_o_r_y to music, first applied to _a_t_o_n_a_l_ _m_u_s_i_c.
Speculative music theory, contrasted with analytic music theory, is devoted to
the analysis and synthesis of music materials, for example _t_u_n_i_n_g_ _s_y_s_t_e_m_s,
generally as preparation for composition.

In the West, much of the history of music that is taught deals with the Western
civilization's art music. The history of music in other cultures ("_w_o_r_l_d_ _m_u_s_i_c"
or the field of "ethnomusicology") is also taught in Western universities. This
includes the documented classical traditions of Asian countries outside the
influence of Western Europe, as well as the folk or indigenous music of various
other cultures. Popular styles of music varied widely from culture to culture,
and from period to period. Different cultures emphasised different _i_n_s_t_r_u_m_e_n_t_s,
or techniques, or uses for music. Music has been used not only for
entertainment, for ceremonies, and for practical and artistic communication,
but also for _p_r_o_p_a_g_a_n_d_a.
There is a host of music classifications, many of which are caught up in the
argument over the definition of music. Among the largest of these is the
division between classical music (or "art" music), and popular music (or
_c_o_m_m_e_r_c_i_a_l_ _m_u_s_i_c ‚Äì including _r_o_c_k_ _m_u_s_i_c, _c_o_u_n_t_r_y_ _m_u_s_i_c, and _p_o_p_ _m_u_s_i_c). Some
genres do not fit neatly into one of these "big two" classifications, (such as
folk music, world music, or jazz music).
As world cultures have come into _g_r_e_a_t_e_r_ _c_o_n_t_a_c_t, their indigenous musical
styles have often merged into new styles. For example, the United States
_b_l_u_e_g_r_a_s_s style contains elements from _A_n_g_l_o-_I_r_i_s_h, _S_c_o_t_t_i_s_h, Irish, _G_e_r_m_a_n and
African instrumental and vocal traditions, which were able to fuse in the
United States' multi-ethnic society. Genres of music are determined as much by
tradition and presentation as by the actual music. Some works, like _G_e_o_r_g_e
_G_e_r_s_h_w_i_n's _R_h_a_p_s_o_d_y_ _i_n_ _B_l_u_e, are claimed by both jazz and classical music,
while Gershwin's _P_o_r_g_y_ _a_n_d_ _B_e_s_s and _L_e_o_n_a_r_d_ _B_e_r_n_s_t_e_i_n's _W_e_s_t_ _S_i_d_e_ _S_t_o_r_y are
claimed by both opera and the _B_r_o_a_d_w_a_y_ _m_u_s_i_c_a_l tradition. Many current music
festivals celebrate a particular musical genre.
_I_n_d_i_a_n_ _m_u_s_i_c, for example, is one of the oldest and longest living types of
music, and is still widely heard and performed in South Asia, as well as
internationally (especially since the 1960s). Indian music has mainly three
forms of classical music, _H_i_n_d_u_s_t_a_n_i, _C_a_r_n_a_t_i_c, and _D_h_r_u_p_a_d styles. It has also
a large repertoire of styles, which involve only percussion music such as the
talavadya performances famous in _S_o_u_t_h_ _I_n_d_i_a.

_M_u_s_i_c_ _t_h_e_r_a_p_y is an interpersonal process in which the therapist uses music and
all of its facets‚Äîphysical, emotional, mental, social, aesthetic, and
spiritual‚Äîto help clients to improve or maintain their health. In some
instances, the client's needs are addressed directly through music; in others
they are addressed through the relationships that develop between the client
and therapist. Music therapy is used with individuals of all ages and with a
variety of conditions, including: psychiatric disorders, medical problems,
physical handicaps, sensory impairments, developmental disabilities, substance
abuse, communication disorders, interpersonal problems, and aging. It is also
used to: improve learning, build self-esteem, reduce stress, _s_u_p_p_o_r_t_ _p_h_y_s_i_c_a_l
_e_x_e_r_c_i_s_e, and facilitate a host of other health-related activities.
One of the earliest mentions of music therapy was in _A_l_-_F_a_r_a_b_i_'_s (c. 872 ‚Äì
950) treatise Meanings of the Intellect, which described the _t_h_e_r_a_p_e_u_t_i_c
effects of music on the _s_o_u_l._[_4_0_][_v_e_r_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] Music has long been used
to help people deal with their emotions. In the 17th century, the scholar
_R_o_b_e_r_t_ _B_u_r_t_o_n's _T_h_e_ _A_n_a_t_o_m_y_ _o_f_ _M_e_l_a_n_c_h_o_l_y argued that music and dance were
critical in treating _m_e_n_t_a_l_ _i_l_l_n_e_s_s, especially _m_e_l_a_n_c_h_o_l_i_a._[_4_1_] He noted that
music has an "excellent power ...to expel many other diseases" and he called it
"a sovereign remedy against despair and melancholy." He pointed out that in
Antiquity, Canus, a Rhodian fiddler, used music to "make a melancholy man
merry, ...a lover more enamoured, a religious man more devout." _[_4_2_]_[_4_3_]_[_4_4_] In
November 2006, Dr. Michael J. Crawford_[_4_5_] and his colleagues also found that
music therapy helped _s_c_h_i_z_o_p_h_r_e_n_i_c patients._[_4_6_] In the _O_t_t_o_m_a_n_ _E_m_p_i_r_e, mental
illnesses were treated with music._[_4_7_]
