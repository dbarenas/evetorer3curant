refer, to that which is other than the initial concept being considered. The
Constitutive Other often denotes a person Other than one's self; hence, the
Other is identified as "different"; thus the spelling is often capitalized.

A person's definition of the 'Other' is part of what defines or even
_c_o_n_s_t_i_t_u_t_e_s_ _t_h_e_ _s_e_l_f (in both a _p_s_y_c_h_o_l_o_g_i_c_a_l and _p_h_i_l_o_s_o_p_h_i_c_a_l sense) and
other phenomena and cultural units. It has been used in _s_o_c_i_a_l_ _s_c_i_e_n_c_e to
understand the processes by which societies and groups exclude 'Others' whom
they want to subordinate or who do not fit into their society. The concept of
'otherness' is also integral to the comprehending of a person, as people
construct roles for themselves in relation to an 'other' as part of a process
of reaction that is not necessarily related to stigmatization or condemnation.
Othering is imperative to national identities, where practices of admittance
and segregation can form and sustain boundaries and national character.
Othering helps distinguish between home and away, the uncertain or certain. It
often involves the demonization and dehumanization of groups, which further
justifies attempts to civilize and exploit these 'inferior' others.
The idea of the other was formalized by _E_m_m_a_n_u_e_l_ _L_e_v_i_n_a_s, and later made
popular by _E_d_w_a_r_d_ _S_a_i_d in his well-known book _O_r_i_e_n_t_a_l_i_s_m.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]
Despite originally being a philosophical concept, othering has political,
economic, social and psychological connotations and implications.
Other sources, just incidentally prior, include Sartre (Being and Nothingness),
Heidegger, even deBeauvoir.

The concept that the self requires the Other to define itself is an old one and
has been expressed by many writers:
_H_e_g_e_l was among the first to introduce the idea of the other as constituent in
_s_e_l_f_-_c_o_n_s_c_i_o_u_s_n_e_s_s. For a direct antecedent, see _F_i_c_h_t_e.
_H_u_s_s_e_r_l used the idea as a basis for _i_n_t_e_r_s_u_b_j_e_c_t_i_v_i_t_y. _S_a_r_t_r_e also made use of
such a dialectic in _B_e_i_n_g_ _a_n_d_ _N_o_t_h_i_n_g_n_e_s_s, when describing how the world is
altered at the appearance of another person, how the world now appears to
orient itself around this other person. At the level Sartre presented it,
however, it was without any life-threatening need for resolution, but as a
feeling or phenomenon and not as a radical threat. _B_e_a_u_v_o_i_r made use of
otherness ‚Äî in similar fashion to Sartre (though it is likely he took the
idea from her) ‚Äî in _T_h_e_ _S_e_c_o_n_d_ _S_e_x. In fact, Beauvoir refers to Hegel's
master-slave dialectic as analogous, in many respects, to the relationship of
man and woman.
The _F_r_e_n_c_h _p_s_y_c_h_o_a_n_a_l_y_s_t _J_a_c_q_u_e_s_ _L_a_c_a_n and the _L_i_t_h_u_a_n_i_a_n-French philosopher
_E_m_m_a_n_u_e_l_ _L_√_©_v_i_n_a_s were instrumental in coining contemporary usage of "the
Other," as radically other. Lacan associated the Other with _t_h_e_ _s_y_m_b_o_l_i_c_ _o_r_d_e_r
and language. Levinas connected it with the scriptural and traditional God, in
The Infinite Other.
Ethically, for Levinas, the "Other" is superior or prior to the self; the mere
presence of the Other makes demands before one can respond by helping them or
ignoring them[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]. This idea and that of the _f_a_c_e_-_t_o_-_f_a_c_e
encounter were re-written later, taking on _D_e_r_r_i_d_a's points made about the
impossibility of a _p_u_r_e_ _p_r_e_s_e_n_c_e of the Other (the Other could be other than
this pure _a_l_t_e_r_i_t_y first encountered), and so issues of language and
representation arose. This "re-write" was accomplished in part with Levinas'
analysis of the distinction between "_t_h_e_ _s_a_y_i_n_g_ _a_n_d_ _t_h_e_ _s_a_i_d" but still
maintaining a priority of ethics over metaphysics.
Levinas talks of the Other in terms of 'insomnia' and 'wakefulness'. It is an
_e_c_s_t_a_s_y, or exteriority toward the Other that forever remains beyond any
attempt at full capture, this otherness is interminable (or infinite); even in
murdering another, the otherness remains, it has not been negated or
controlled. This "infiniteness" of the Other will allow Levinas to derive other
aspects of philosophy and science as secondary to this ethic. Levinas writes:
     The others that obsess me in the other do not affect me as examples
     of the same genus united with my neighbor by resemblance or common
     nature, _i_n_d_i_v_i_d_u_a_t_i_o_n_s of the human race, or chips off the old
     block... The others concern me from the first. Here fraternity
     precedes the commonness of a _g_e_n_u_s. My relationship with the Other as
     neighbor gives meaning to my relations with all the others._[_1_]
The "Other", as a general term in philosophy, can also be used to mean the
unconscious, silence, _i_n_s_a_n_i_t_y, the other of language (i.e., what it refers to
and what is unsaid), etc.
There may also arise a tendency towards _r_e_l_a_t_i_v_i_s_m if the Other, as pure
alterity, leads to a notion that ignores the commonality of _t_r_u_t_h. Likewise,
issues may arise around non-ethical uses of the term, and related terms, that
reinforce divisions.

Before the modern world system where the politics and economy of nation-states
are relatively interdependent, there existed what is classified as the "system
of world empires" up until the 1500s. In this world system political and
economic affairs of different empires were fragmented and empires "provided for
most of their own needs... [spreading] their influence solely through conquest
or the threat of conquest..."_[_2_] The Dictionary of Human Geography defines
imperialism as "The creation and maintenance of an unequal economic, cultural
and territorial relationship, usually between states and often in the form of
an empire, based on domination and subordination."_[_3_] The maintenance of this
unequal relationship wholly depends on the subordination of an "other" group or
peoples, from which resources can be taken and land can be exploited. Other,
then, describes the process of justifying the domination of individuals or
groups in the periphery to facilitate subordination. The creation of the other
is done by highlighting their weakness, thus extenuating the moral
responsibility of the stronger self to educate, convert, or civilize depending
on the identity of the other. Indeed, as defined by Martin Jones et al.,
othering is "A term, advocated by _E_d_w_a_r_d_ _S_a_i_d, which refers to the act of
emphasizing the perceived weaknesses of marginalized groups as a way of
stressing the alleged strength of those in positions of _p_o_w_e_r."[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n
_n_e_e_d_e_d] Othering can be done with any racial, ethnic, religious, or
geographically-defined category of people.
In keeping with the example of imperial Britain, the discussion of empire
building through othering unfolds in a global context. Empire building stands
in fundamental opposition to global community; instead of understanding groups
of people, and consequentially their intellectual, economic, and political
capability as vital and contributory to the global community, othering renders
all but one culture's ideology and systems worthless. _I_m_m_a_n_u_e_l_ _W_a_l_l_e_r_s_t_e_i_n's
world systems theory is a more modern criticism of othering and the doctrine of
discrimination and racism in society, economics, and all other fronts. Imperial
Britain saw the values or good qualities of other cultures or powers as a
threat to its own power‚Äîthis was the case even with other economic and
industrial powers such as Germany.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]

Scholars such as _M_i_c_h_e_l_ _F_o_u_c_a_u_l_t, the _F_r_a_n_k_f_u_r_t_ _S_c_h_o_o_l and other _p_o_s_t_m_o_d_e_r_n_i_s_t_s
have argued that the process of othering has everything to do with knowledge,
and power acting through knowledge to achieve a particular political agenda in
its goal of domination._[_4_] Edward Said quotes the following from Nietzsche,_[_5_]
saying what is the truth of language but
     ...a mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms‚Äîin
     short, a sum of human relations, which have been enhanced,
     transposed, and embellished poetically and rhetorically, and which
     after long use seem firm, canonical, and obligatory to a people:
     truths are illusions about which one has forgotten that this is what
     they are._[_6_]
The knowledge of this sheds much light on historiographies of other cultures
created by the dominant culture, and by the discourses, whether academic or
otherwise, that surround these written and oral histories. The cultures that a
supposed superior ethnic group deems important to study, and the different
aspects of that culture that are either ignored or considered valuable
knowledge, relies on the judgment of the ethnic group in power. In the case of
historiographies of the Middle East, and the Oriental discipline, another
dynamic adds depth to this issue. Prior to the late nineteenth century, western
(specifically European) empires studied what was said to be high culture of the
Middle East, being literature, language, and philology; however, a reciprocal
program and curriculum of study did not exist in the Orient which looked at
European lands._[_7_] Distortions in the writing of history have carried over to
the post-modern era in the writing of news. As mentioned before under examples
of intranational othering, political parties in developing countries sometimes
create facts on the ground, report threats that are nonexistent, and extenuate
the faults of opposing political parties which are made up of opposing ethnic
groups in the majority of cases._[_8_] Othering via ideas of ethnocentricity‚Äîthe
belief that one's own ethnic group is superior to all others and the tendency
to evaluate and assign meaning to other ethnicities using yours as a standard
_[_9_] ‚Äîis additionally achieved through processes as mundane as cartography.
The drawing of maps has historically emphasized and bolstered specific lands
and their associated national identities. Cartographers in early centuries
commonly distorted actual locations and distances when depicting them on maps;
British cartographers for example centered Britain on their maps, and drew it
proportionally larger than it should be. Polar perspectives of the Northern
Hemisphere drawn by recent American cartographers uses spatial relations
between the United States and Russia to emphasize superiority._[_1_0_]

_S_i_m_o_n_e_ _D_e_ _B_e_a_u_v_o_i_r changed the Hegelian notion of the Other, for use in her
description of male-dominated culture. This treats woman as the Other in
relation to man. The Other has thus become an important concept for studies of
the sex-gender system. _M_i_c_h_a_e_l_ _W_a_r_n_e_r argues that:
     the modern system of sex and gender would not be possible without a
     disposition to interpret the difference between genders as the
     difference between self and Other ... having a sexual object of the
     opposite gender is taken to be the normal and _p_a_r_a_d_i_g_m_a_t_i_c form of an
     interest in the Other or, more generally, others.
Thus, according to Warner, _F_r_e_u_d_i_a_n and _L_a_c_a_n_i_a_n psychoanalysis hold the
_h_e_t_e_r_o_s_e_x_i_s_t view that if one is attracted to people of the same gender as
one's self, one fails to distinguish self and other, identification and desire.
This is a "regressive" or an "arrested" function.[_c_l_a_r_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] He
further argues that _h_e_t_e_r_o_n_o_r_m_a_t_i_v_i_t_y covers its own _n_a_r_c_i_s_s_i_s_t_i_c investments
by _p_r_o_j_e_c_t_i_n_g or displacing them on _q_u_e_e_r_n_e_s_s.
Beauvoir calls the Other the _m_i_n_o_r_i_t_y, the least favored one and often a woman,
when compared to a man, "for a man represents both the positive and the
neutral, as indicated by the common use of man to designate human beings in
general; whereas woman represents only the negative, defined by limiting
criteria, without reciprocity" (McCann, 33). _B_e_t_t_y_ _F_r_i_e_d_a_n supported this
thought when she interviewed women and the majority of them identified
themselves in their role in the private sphere, rather than addressing their
own personal achievements. They automatically identified as the Other without
knowing. Although the Other may be influenced by a socially constructed
society, one can argue that society has the power to change this creation
(_H_a_s_l_a_n_g_e_r).
In an effort to dismantle the notion of the Other, _C_h_e_s_h_i_r_e_ _C_a_l_h_o_u_n proposed a
_d_e_c_o_n_s_t_r_u_c_t_i_o_n of the word "woman" from a subordinate association and to
_r_e_c_o_n_s_t_r_u_c_t it by proving women do not need to be rationalized by male
dominance._[_1_1_] This would contribute to the idea of the Other and minimize the
hierarchal connotation this word implies.
_S_a_r_o_j_i_n_i_ _S_a_h_o_o, an _I_n_d_i_a_n feminist writer, agrees with De Beauvoir that women
can only free themselves by "thinking, taking action, working, creating, on the
same terms as men; instead of seeking to disparage them, she declares herself
their equal." She disagrees, however, that though women have the same status to
men as human beings, they have their own identity and they are different from
men. They are "others" in real definition, but this is not in context with
Hegelian definition of "others". It is not always due to man's "active" and
"subjective" demands. They are the others, unknowingly accepting the
subjugation as a part of "subjectivity"._[_1_2_] Sahoo, however contends that
whilst the woman identity is certainly constitutionally different from that of
man, men and women still share a basic human equality. Thus the harmful
asymmetric sex/gender "Othering" arises accidentally and ‚Äòpassively' from
natural, unavoidable intersubjectivity._[_1_3_]
