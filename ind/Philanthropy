PPhhiillaanntthhrrooppyy _e_t_y_m_o_l_o_g_i_c_a_l_l_y means "love of humanity" in the sense of caring
for, nourishing, developing, and enhancing "what it is to be human" on both the
benefactors' (by identifying and exercising their values in giving and
volunteering) and beneficiaries' (by benefitting) parts. The most conventional
modern definition is "private initiatives, for public good, focusing on quality
of life" (see below).
The word was first coined as an adjective, by Aeschylus in Prometheus Bound
(line 11, 460 BC), to describe Prometheus' character as "humanity loving"
(philanthropos tropos), for having given to the earliest proto-humans, who had
no culture, fire (symbolizing all the arts civilization) and "blind hope"
(optimism). Together, they would be used to improve the human condition, to
save mankind from destruction. Thus humans were distinguished from all other
animals by civilization the power to complete their own creation through
education (self-development) and culture (civic development), expressed in good
works benefitting others. The Greek word for a philanthropic culture was
paideia._[_1_]
The first use of the noun form philanthr√¥p√≠a came shortly thereafter (ca. 390
BC) in the early Platonic dialogue Euthyphro, where Socrates is reported to
have said that his "pouring out" of his thoughts freely (without charge) to his
listeners was his philanthr√¥p√≠a. The Philosophical Dictionary of the Platonic
Academy defined philanthr√¥p√≠a as "A state of well educated habits stemming
from love of humanity. A state of being productive of benefit to humans. A
state of grace. Mindfulness together with good works." In the first century BC,
both paideia and philanthr√¥p√≠a were translated into Latin by the single word
humanitas which was also understood to be the core of liberal education studia
humanitatis, the studies of humanity, or simply "the humanities". In the second
century AD, Plutarch used the concept of philanthr√¥p√≠a to describe superior
human beings. This Classically synonymous troika, of philanthropy, the
humanities, and liberal education, declined with the Fall of Rome, during the
Middle Ages philanthr√¥p√≠a was superseded by caritas charity, selfless love,
valued for salvation. The Classical notion was revived with the Renaissance,
and flourished through the 18th century as a central secular value of the
Enlightenment, in this spirit it was cited by Alexander Hamilton "This will add
the inducements of philanthropy to those of patriotism...." in the opening
paragraph of the First Federalist Paper, as a rationale for ratifying our
Constitution._[_2_]
In the twentieth century the long humanistic tradition and culture of
philanthropy as Classically conceived, was superseded by social scientific
terminology. Today "philanthropy" is conventionally defined as "private
initiatives, for public good, focusing on quality of life", thus combining the
_s_o_c_i_a_l_ _s_c_i_e_n_t_i_f_i_c aspect developed in the 20th century with the original
_h_u_m_a_n_i_s_t_i_c tradition, serving to contrast philanthropy with _b_u_s_i_n_e_s_s (private
initiatives for private good, focusing on material prosperity) and government
(public initiatives for public good, focusing on law and order)._[_3_] Instances
of philanthropy commonly overlap with instances of _c_h_a_r_i_t_y, though not all
charity is philanthropy, or vice versa. The difference commonly cited is that
charity relieves the pains of social problems, whereas philanthropy attempts to
solve those problems at their root causes the difference between giving a
hungry man a fish, and teaching him how to fish for himself. A person who
practices philanthropy is called a pphhiillaanntthhrrooppiisstt.

The classical view of philanthropy‚Äîthat the "love of what it is to be human"
is the essential nature and purpose of humanity, culture and civilization‚Äîis
intrinsically philosophical, containing both metaphysics and ethics. It asserts
that our nature and purpose in life is educational‚Äîto make ourselves more
fully humane through self-development, pursuing excellence (arete) of body,
mind and spirit. The ancient Greek word for culture as education was _p_a_i_d_e_i_a.
Paideia and "philanthrop√≠a were both later translated by the Romans into Latin
by one word‚Äîsignificantly, humanities.

The total economic collapse attending the Fall of Rome and leading into the so-
called "Dark Ages" dissolved Classical civilization, replacing it with
Christian theology and _s_o_t_e_r_i_o_l_o_g_y, administered through the Roman Catholic
Church's ecclesiastical and monastic infrastructures. Gradually there emerged a
non-religious agricultural infrastructure based on peasant farming organized
into manors, which were in turn organized for law and order by _f_e_u_d_a_l_i_s_m. For a
thousand years Classical humanism hibernated in forgotten manuscripts of
monastic libraries. When it was rediscovered in the Italian Renaissance,
_h_u_m_a_n_i_s_m consisted of a specific academic curriculum: grammar, rhetoric,
poetry, history, and moral philosophy, or ethics, designed to train laymen for
effective leadership in business, law, and government. One of the clearest
literary expressions of _R_e_n_a_i_s_s_a_n_c_e_ _h_u_m_a_n_i_s_t philosophy is _P_i_c_o_ _d_e_l_l_a
_M_i_r_a_n_d_o_l_a's famous 15th-century _O_r_a_t_i_o_n_ _o_n_ _t_h_e_ _D_i_g_n_i_t_y_ _o_f_ _M_a_n, which echoes the
philanthropic myth of human creation, though with the Christian God as the
Promethean Creator.
Europe emerged from the 16th-17th century Wars of Religion ready to try secular
alternatives, for which humanistic philosophies of Rationalism and Empiricism,
fortified by the Scientific Revolutions, inclined lay philosophers toward the
progressive view of history inaugurated by Classical philanthropy. This
tendency achieved an especially pure articulation in the Scottish
Enlightenment, several of whose leading philosophers proposed philanthropy as
the essential key to human happiness, conceived as a kind of "fitness"‚Äîliving
in harmony with Nature and one's own circumstances. Self-development,
manifested in good deeds toward others, was the surest way to live a pleasing,
fulfilling, and satisfying life, as well as to help build a commonwealth
community.

It is generally agreed that the word was coined in _A_n_c_i_e_n_t_ _G_r_e_e_c_e by the
_p_l_a_y_w_r_i_g_h_t _A_e_s_c_h_y_l_u_s, or whoever else wrote _P_r_o_m_e_t_h_e_u_s_ _B_o_u_n_d. There (in line
11) the author told as a myth how the primitive creatures that were created to
be human at first had no knowledge, skills, or culture of any kind‚Äîso they
lived in caves, in the dark, in constant fear for their lives. _Z_e_u_s, the king
of the gods, decided to destroy them, but _P_r_o_m_e_t_h_e_u_s, a _T_i_t_a_n whose name meant
"forethought," out of his "philanthropos tropos" or "humanity-loving
character", gave them two empowering, life-enhancing gifts: fire, symbolizing
all knowledge, skills, technology, arts, and science; and "blind hope" or
_o_p_t_i_m_i_s_m. The two went together‚Äîwith fire, humans could be optimistic; with
optimism, they would use fire constructively, to improve the human condition.
The new word, œÜŒπŒªŒ¨ŒΩŒ∏œÅœâœÄŒøœÇ philanthropos, combined two words:
_œ_Ü_Œ_Ø_Œ_ª_Œ_ø_œ_Ç philos, "loving" in the sense of benefitting, caring for,
nourishing; and _·_º_Ñ_Œ_Ω_Œ_∏_œ_Å_œ_â_œ_Ä_Œ_ø_œ_Ç anthropos, "human being" in the sense of
"humanity", or "human-ness". At that mythical point in time, human
individuality did not yet exist because there was no culture‚Äîincluding
language, skills, and other differentiating attributes. What Prometheus
evidently "loved", therefore, was not individual humans or groups of
individuals, but humanity as a kind of being, human potential‚Äîwhat these
proto-humans could become with "fire" and "blind hope". The two gifts in effect
completed the creation of humankind as a distinctly civilized being.
'PPhhiillaanntthhrroopp√√≠≠aa''‚Äîloving what it is to be human‚Äîwas thought to be the key to
and essence of civilization._[_5_]
The Greeks adopted the "love of humanity" as an educational ideal, whose goal
was excellence (_a_r_e_t_e)‚Äîthe fullest self-development, of body, mind, and
spirit, which is the essence of liberal education. The _P_l_a_t_o_n_i_c_ _A_c_a_d_e_m_y's
philosophical dictionary defined Philanthropia as: "A state of well-educated
habits stemming from love of humanity. A state of being productive of benefit
to humans." Philanthropia was later translated by the Romans into Latin as,
simply, humanitas‚Äîhumane-ness. And because Prometheus‚Äô human-empowering
gifts rebelled against Zeus‚Äô tyranny, philanthropia was also associated with
freedom and democracy. Both Socrates and the laws of Athens were described as
"philanthropic and democratic"‚Äîa common expression, the idea being that
philanthropic humans are reliably capable of self-government.
Putting all this together in modern terms, there are four relatively
authoritative definitions of "philanthropy" that come close to the Classical
concept: _J_o_h_n_ _W_._ _G_a_r_d_n_e_r‚Äôs "private initiatives for the public good"; Robert
Payton‚Äôs "voluntary action for the public good"; _L_e_s_t_e_r_ _S_a_l_a_m_o_n‚Äôs "the
private giving of time or valuables‚Ä¶for public purposes" and Robert
Bremner‚Äôs "the aim of philanthropy‚Ä¶is improvement in the quality of human
life". Combining these to connect modern philanthropy with its entire previous
history, "philanthropy" may best be defined as "private initiatives for public
good, focusing on quality of life".
This distinguishes it from government (public initiatives for public good) and
business (private initiatives for private good). Omitting the definite article
"the" with "public good" avoids the dubious assumption that there is ever a
single, knowable public good, and, in any case, people rarely, if ever, agree
on what that might be; rather, this definition says merely that the benefactor
intends a "public", rather than an exclusively "private", good or benefit. The
inclusion of "quality of life" ensures the strong humanistic emphasis of the
Promethean archetype.
The classical view of philanthropy disappeared in the Middle Ages, was
rediscovered and revived with the Renaissance, and came into the English
language in the early 17th century. _S_i_r_ _F_r_a_n_c_i_s_ _B_a_c_o_n in 1592 wrote in a letter
that his "vast contemplative ends" expressed his "philanthropia", and his 1608
essay On Goodness defined his subject as "the affecting of the _w_e_a_l_e of men...
what the Grecians call philanthropia". _H_e_n_r_y_ _C_o_c_k_e_r_a_m, in his English
dictionary (1623), cited "philanthropie" as a synonym for "humanitie"(in Latin,
humanitas) ‚Äî thus reaffirming the Classical formulation. In that form it came
into full flower as a leading ideal of the Enlightenment, and particularly of
the Scottish Enlightenment, in the works of Anthony Ashley Cooper, Earl of
Shaftesbury, and Frances Hutcheson. From there it entered the mainstream of
American Enlightenment thought, and the spirit of philanthropy that informed
the American Revolution‚Äîsee _P_h_i_l_a_n_t_h_r_o_p_y_ _i_n_ _t_h_e_ _U_n_i_t_e_d_ _S_t_a_t_e_s.

In 19th-century America, the word "philanthropy" and its variants tended to
drift in meaning and importance, generally to be associated with "doing good"
and‚Äîderogatorily‚Äî"do-gooders"‚Äîe.g., _T_h_o_r_e_a_u, in Walden. In the 20th
century, American philanthropy matured, with the development of very large
private foundations created by titans of industry‚Äî_R_o_c_k_e_f_e_l_l_e_r, _F_o_r_d,
_C_a_r_n_e_g_i_e, et al.‚Äîand later in the century with the professionalization of the
field led and funded by those great foundations. The sheer size of their
endowments directed their attention to addressing the causes and instruments,
as distinct from the symptoms and expressions, of social problems and cultural
opportunities. The word "philanthropy" came to be associated exclusively with
its most conspicuous manifestations, foundations and grant-making. Professional
fundraisers almost never used the word, always referring to their individual
charity employers rather than to philanthropy in general or as a cultural
phenomenon. The increasing dominance of the profession by social scientists or
former social science majors tended to focus professional attention on
technical and procedural issues rather than substantive values, on means rather
than ends, on questions of how rather than why. Many professionals considered
the word "philanthropy" to sound unnecessarily pretentious, pompous, pedantic,
and in any case meaningless because the Classical view had been lost entirely,
with the decline of the humanities and the classics in education._[_6_]
Then at the turn of the 21st century, the word "philanthropy" began to re-enter
the American vernacular. In 1997 a Massachusetts project of foundations,
corporations and donors to increase charitable giving through donor education
was centered on a Catalogue for Philanthropy. In 1998 leading national
grantmakers funded a collaborative project to increase charitable giving
through regional programs. Wealth creators in the new high-tech global economy,
having amassed great fortunes exceeding even those of the previous century,
were turning to second careers in philanthropy at earlier ages, creating even
larger foundations. Individual philanthropy began to be chic, attracting
celebrities from popular arts. Commercial movies and television adopted the
word and idea, and a leading Classically American philanthropic initiative by
_B_i_l_l_ _G_a_t_e_s and _W_a_r_r_e_n_ _B_u_f_f_e_t_t, the "Giving Pledge", used the word with global
publicity.
In scholarship, the 20th century rise to dominance by the social sciences
focused attention on academic social theories and ideals‚Äî"_c_i_v_i_l
_s_o_c_i_e_t_y"‚Äîand technical jargon‚Äîthe "third sector" and "nonprofits". In
ARNOVA (the Association for Research on Nonprofit and Voluntary Action), the
relevant academic society, scholars with humanistic training and orientation
formed a small but growing minority of generally younger members. The emergence
of the word "nonprofit" can be tracked by its appearance in increasing numbers
of dissertation titles: 1 in 1959, 7 in the '60s, 49 in the '70s, 238 in the
'80s and on up. By the early 21st century the word "nonprofit" was generally
accepted as synonymous with philanthropy, though practitioners found it
disadvantageously negative in fundraising and meaningless to donors. In 2011
its factual relevance was challenged by the _M_a_s_s_a_c_h_u_s_e_t_t_s_ _P_h_i_l_a_n_t_h_r_o_p_i_c
_D_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y_ _(_M_P_D_), which found that fewer than 10% of "nonprofits" are
philanthropies. In _o_r_g_a_n_i_z_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _s_t_u_d_i_e_s, philanthropy by corporations (i.e.,
corporate philanthropy) is often defined as charitable monetary donations,
including donations in areas such as the arts, education, housing, health,
social welfare, and the environment, among others, but excluding political
contributions and commercial sponsorship._[_7_]
