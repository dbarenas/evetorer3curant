PPhhoottooggrraapphhyy (derived from the _G_r_e_e_k photos- for "light" and -graphos for

of a light-sensitive material such as _p_h_o_t_o_g_r_a_p_h_i_c_ _f_i_l_m, or electronically by
means of an _i_m_a_g_e_ _s_e_n_s_o_r._[_1_] Typically, a _l_e_n_s is used to _f_o_c_u_s the light

depending on the purpose of the photographic material and the method of
_p_r_o_c_e_s_s_i_n_g. A negative image on film is traditionally used to photographically
create a positive image on a paper base, known as a _p_r_i_n_t, either by using an
_e_n_l_a_r_g_e_r or by _c_o_n_t_a_c_t_ _p_r_i_n_t_i_n_g.

wrote in his diary the word "photographie" to describe his process._[_2_] As far

_S_o_c_i_e_t_y of London, on March 14, 1839 who made the word "photography" known to
the world. But in an article published on February 25 of the same year in a

_R_o_c_h_e, described what can be interpreted as photography._[_1_4_]
The discovery of the camera obscura that provides an image of a scene dates
back to ancient China. Leonardo da Vinci mentions natural cameras obscura that
are formed by dark caves on the edge of a sunlit valley. A hole in the cave
wall will act as a pinhole camera and project a laterally reversed, upside down
image on a piece of paper. So the birth of photography was primarily concerned
with developing a means to fix and retain the image produced by the camera
obscura.
The first success of reproducing images without a camera occurred when _T_h_o_m_a_s
_W_e_d_g_w_o_o_d, from the famous family of potters, obtained copies of paintings on
leather using silver salts. Since he had no way of permanently fixing those
reproductions (stabilizing the image by washing out the non-exposed silver
salts), they would turn completely black in the light and thus had to be kept
in a dark room for viewing.
Renaissance painters used the camera obscura which, in fact, gives the optical
rendering in color that dominates Western Art. The camera obscura literally
means "dark chamber" in Latin. It is a box with a hole in it which allows light
to go through and create an image onto the piece of paper.

Invented in the first decades of the 19th century, photography (by way of the
camera) seemed able to capture more detail and information than traditional
media, such as painting and sculpting._[_1_6_] Photography as a usable process goes
back to the 1820s with the development of chemical photography. The first
permanent _p_h_o_t_o_e_t_c_h_i_n_g was an image produced in 1822_[_7_] by the _F_r_e_n_c_h inventor
_N_i_c_√_©_p_h_o_r_e_ _N_i_√_©_p_c_e, but it was destroyed by a later attempt to duplicate it._[_7_]
Ni√©pce was successful again in 1825. He made the first permanent photograph
from nature (his _V_i_e_w_ _f_r_o_m_ _t_h_e_ _W_i_n_d_o_w_ _a_t_ _L_e_ _G_r_a_s) with a camera obscura in
1826._[_1_7_]
Because his photographs took so long to _e_x_p_o_s_e (eight hours), he sought to find
a new process. Working in conjunction with _L_o_u_i_s_ _D_a_g_u_e_r_r_e, they experimented
with silver compounds based on a _J_o_h_a_n_n_ _H_e_i_n_r_i_c_h_ _S_c_h_u_l_t_z discovery in 1816 that
a silver and chalk mixture darkens when exposed to light. Ni√©pce died in 1833,
but Daguerre continued the work, eventually culminating with the development of
the _d_a_g_u_e_r_r_e_o_t_y_p_e in 1837. Daguerre took the first ever photo of a person in
1838 when, while taking a daguerreotype of a Paris street, a pedestrian stopped
for a shoe shine, long enough to be captured by the long exposure (several
minutes). Eventually, France agreed to pay Daguerre a pension for his formula,
in exchange for his promise to announce his discovery to the world as the gift
of France, which he did in 1839.
A latticed window in _L_a_c_o_c_k_ _A_b_b_e_y, England, photographed by _W_i_l_l_i_a_m_ _F_o_x_ _T_a_l_b_o_t
in 1835. Shown here in positive form, this is the oldest known extant
photographic negative made in a camera.
Meanwhile, _H_e_r_c_u_l_e_s_ _F_l_o_r_e_n_c_e had already created a very similar process in 1832
in Brazil, naming it Photographie, and English inventor _W_i_l_l_i_a_m_ _F_o_x_ _T_a_l_b_o_t had
earlier discovered another means to fix a silver process image but had kept it
secret. After reading about Daguerre's invention, Talbot refined his process so
that portraits were made readily available to the masses. By 1840, Talbot had
invented the _c_a_l_o_t_y_p_e process, which creates _n_e_g_a_t_i_v_e images._[_1_8_] Talbot's
famous 1835 print of the Oriel window in _L_a_c_o_c_k_ _A_b_b_e_y is the oldest known
negative in existence._[_1_9_]_[_2_0_]
_J_o_h_n_ _H_e_r_s_c_h_e_l made many contributions to the new methods. He invented the
_c_y_a_n_o_t_y_p_e process, now familiar as the "blueprint". He was the first to use the
terms "photography", "negative" and "positive". He discovered sodium
thiosulphate solution to be a solvent of silver halides in 1819, and informed
Talbot and Daguerre of his discovery in 1839 that it could be used to "fix"
pictures and make them permanent. He made the first _g_l_a_s_s_ _n_e_g_a_t_i_v_e in late
1839.

In March 1851, _F_r_e_d_e_r_i_c_k_ _S_c_o_t_t_ _A_r_c_h_e_r published his findings in "The Chemist"
on the wet plate _c_o_l_l_o_d_i_o_n process. This became the most widely used process
between 1852 and the late 1860s when the dry plate was introduced. There are
three subsets to the collodion process; the _A_m_b_r_o_t_y_p_e (positive image on
glass), the _F_e_r_r_o_t_y_p_e or Tintype (positive image on metal) and the negative
which was printed on _a_l_b_u_m_e_n or salt paper.
Many advances in photographic glass plates and printing were made in through
the 19th century. In 1884, _G_e_o_r_g_e_ _E_a_s_t_m_a_n developed the technology of _f_i_l_m to
replace _p_h_o_t_o_g_r_a_p_h_i_c_ _p_l_a_t_e_s, leading to the technology used by film cameras
today.

All photography was originally monochrome, or _b_l_a_c_k_-_a_n_d_-_w_h_i_t_e. Even after color
film was readily available, black-and-white photography continued to dominate
for decades, due to its lower cost and its "classic" photographic look. It is
important to note that some monochromatic pictures are not always pure blacks
and whites, but also contain other hues depending on the process. The cyanotype
process produces an image composed of blue tones. The albumen process, first
used more than 150 years ago, produces brown tones.
Many photographers continue to produce some monochrome images, often because of
the established archival permanence of well processed silver halide based
materials. Some full color digital images are processed using a variety of
techniques to create black and whites, and some manufacturers produce digital
cameras that exclusively shoot monochrome.

_C_o_l_o_r_ _p_h_o_t_o_g_r_a_p_h_y was explored beginning in the mid-19th century. Early
experiments in color required extremely long exposures (hours or days for
camera images) and could not "fix" the photograph to prevent the color from
quickly fading when exposed to white light.
The first permanent color photograph was taken in 1861 using the three-color-
separation principle first published by physicist _J_a_m_e_s_ _C_l_e_r_k_ _M_a_x_w_e_l_l in 1855.
Maxwell's idea was to take three separate black-and-white photographs through
red, green and blue _f_i_l_t_e_r_s. This provides the _p_h_o_t_o_g_r_a_p_h_e_r with the three
basic channels required to recreate a color image.
Transparent prints of the images could be projected through similar color
filters and superimposed on the projection screen, an _a_d_d_i_t_i_v_e_ _m_e_t_h_o_d of color
reproduction. A color print on paper could be produced by superimposing _c_a_r_b_o_n
_p_r_i_n_t_s of the three images made in their _c_o_m_p_l_e_m_e_n_t_a_r_y_ _c_o_l_o_r_s, a _s_u_b_t_r_a_c_t_i_v_e
_m_e_t_h_o_d of color reproduction pioneered by _L_o_u_i_s_ _D_u_c_o_s_ _d_u_ _H_a_u_r_o_n in the late
1860s.
Russian photographer _S_e_r_g_e_i_ _M_i_k_h_a_i_l_o_v_i_c_h_ _P_r_o_k_u_d_i_n_-_G_o_r_s_k_i_i made extensive use of
this color separation technique, employing a special camera which successively
exposed the three color-filtered images on different parts of an oblong _p_l_a_t_e.
Because his exposures were not simultaneous, unsteady subjects exhibited color
"fringes" or, if rapidly moving through the scene, appeared as brightly colored
ghosts in the resulting projected or printed images.
The development of color photography was hindered by the limited sensitivity of
early photographic materials, which were mostly sensitive to blue, only
slightly sensitive to green, and virtually insensitive to red. The discovery of
dye sensitization by photochemist _H_e_r_m_a_n_n_ _V_o_g_e_l in 1873 suddenly made it
possible to add sensitivity to green, yellow and even red. Improved color
sensitizers and ongoing improvements in the overall sensitivity of _e_m_u_l_s_i_o_n_s
steadily reduced the once-prohibitive long exposure times required for color,
bringing it ever closer to commercial viability.
_A_u_t_o_c_h_r_o_m_e, the first commercially successful color process, was introduced by
the _L_u_m_i_√_®_r_e_ _b_r_o_t_h_e_r_s in 1907. Autochrome _p_l_a_t_e_s incorporated a _m_o_s_a_i_c color
filter layer made of dyed grains of _p_o_t_a_t_o_ _s_t_a_r_c_h, which allowed the three
color components to be recorded as adjacent microscopic image fragments. After
an Autochrome plate was _r_e_v_e_r_s_a_l_ _p_r_o_c_e_s_s_e_d to produce a positive _t_r_a_n_s_p_a_r_e_n_c_y,
the starch grains served to illuminate each fragment with the correct color and
the tiny colored points blended together in the eye, synthesizing the color of
the subject by the _a_d_d_i_t_i_v_e_ _m_e_t_h_o_d. Autochrome plates were one of several
varieties of additive color screen plates and films marketed between the 1890s
and the 1950s.
_K_o_d_a_c_h_r_o_m_e, the first modern "integral tripack" (or "monopack") color film, was
introduced by _K_o_d_a_k in 1935. It captured the three color components in a
multilayer _e_m_u_l_s_i_o_n. One layer was sensitized to record the red-dominated part
of the _s_p_e_c_t_r_u_m, another layer recorded only the green part and a third
recorded only the blue. Without special _f_i_l_m_ _p_r_o_c_e_s_s_i_n_g, the result would
simply be three superimposed black-and-white images, but _c_o_m_p_l_e_m_e_n_t_a_r_y cyan,
magenta, and yellow dye images were created in those layers by adding _c_o_l_o_r
_c_o_u_p_l_e_r_s during a complex processing procedure.
_A_g_f_a_'_s similarly structured _A_g_f_a_c_o_l_o_r_ _N_e_u was introduced in 1936. Unlike
Kodachrome, the color couplers in Agfacolor Neu were incorporated into the
emulsion layers during manufacture, which greatly simplified the processing.
Currently available color films still employ a multilayer emulsion and the same
principles, most closely resembling Agfa's product.
_I_n_s_t_a_n_t_ _c_o_l_o_r_ _f_i_l_m, used in a special camera which yielded a unique finished
color print only a minute or two after the exposure, was introduced by _P_o_l_a_r_o_i_d
in 1963.
Color photography may form images as positive transparencies, which can be used
in a _s_l_i_d_e_ _p_r_o_j_e_c_t_o_r, or as color negatives intended for use in creating
positive color enlargements on specially coated paper. The latter is now the
most common form of film (non-digital) color photography owing to the
introduction of automated photo printing equipment.

for imaging, eliminating the need for film: the _S_o_n_y_ _M_a_v_i_c_a. While the Mavica
saved images to disk, the images were displayed on television, and the camera
was not fully digital. In 1991, Kodak unveiled the _D_C_S_ _1_0_0, the first
commercially available digital single lens reflex camera. Although its high
cost precluded uses other than _p_h_o_t_o_j_o_u_r_n_a_l_i_s_m and professional photography,
commercial _d_i_g_i_t_a_l_ _p_h_o_t_o_g_r_a_p_h_y was born.
Digital imaging uses an electronic _i_m_a_g_e_ _s_e_n_s_o_r to record the image as a set of
electronic data rather than as chemical changes on film. _[_2_1_] An important
difference between digital and chemical photography is that chemical
photography resists _p_h_o_t_o_ _m_a_n_i_p_u_l_a_t_i_o_n because it involves _f_i_l_m and

difference allows for a degree of image post-processing that is comparatively
difficult in film-based photography and permits different communicative
potentials and applications.

Photography gained the interest of many scientists and artists from its
inception. Scientists have used photography to record and study movements, such
as _E_a_d_w_e_a_r_d_ _M_u_y_b_r_i_d_g_e's study of human and animal locomotion in 1887. Artists
are equally interested by these aspects but also try to explore avenues other
than the photo-mechanical representation of reality, such as the _p_i_c_t_o_r_i_a_l_i_s_t
movement.
Military, police, and security forces use photography for surveillance,
recognition and data storage. Photography is used by amateurs to preserve
memories, to capture special moments, to tell stories, to send messages, and as
a source of entertainment. _H_i_g_h_ _s_p_e_e_d_ _p_h_o_t_o_g_r_a_p_h_y allows for visualizing events

can be the film itself, or a digital electronic or magnetic memory._[_2_2_]
Photographers control the camera and lens to "expose" the light recording
material (such as film) to the required amount of light to form a "_l_a_t_e_n_t
_i_m_a_g_e" (on film) or _R_A_W_ _f_i_l_e (in digital cameras) which, after appropriate
processing, is converted to a usable image. _D_i_g_i_t_a_l_ _c_a_m_e_r_a_s use an electronic
image sensor based on light-sensitive electronics such as _c_h_a_r_g_e_-_c_o_u_p_l_e_d_ _d_e_v_i_c_e

resulting digital image is stored electronically, but can be reproduced on
paper or film.
The camera (or '_c_a_m_e_r_a_ _o_b_s_c_u_r_a') is a dark room or chamber from which, as far
as possible, all light is excluded except the light that forms the image. The
subject being photographed, however, must be illuminated. Cameras can range
from small to very large, a whole room that is kept dark while the object to be
photographed is in another room where it is properly illuminated. This was
common for reproduction photography of flat copy when large film negatives were
used (see _P_r_o_c_e_s_s_ _c_a_m_e_r_a).
A general principle known from the birth of photography is that the smaller the
camera, the brighter the image. This meant that as soon as photographic
materials became sensitive enough (fast enough) to take candid or what were
called genre pictures, small detective cameras were used, some of them
disguised as a tie pin that was really a lens, as a piece of luggage or even a
pocket watch (the Ticka camera).
The _m_o_v_i_e_ _c_a_m_e_r_a is a type of photographic camera which takes a rapid sequence
of photographs on strips of film. In contrast to a still camera, which captures
a single snapshot at a time, the movie camera takes a series of images, each
called a "frame". This is accomplished through an intermittent mechanism. The
frames are later played back in a movie projector at a specific speed, called
the "frame rate" (number of frames per second). While viewing, a person's eyes
and brain merge the separate pictures together to create the illusion of
motion._[_2_3_]

In all but certain specialized cameras, the process of obtaining a usable
exposure must involve the use, manually or automatically, of a few controls to
ensure the photograph is clear, sharp and well illuminated. The controls
usually include but are not limited to the following:
CCoonnttrrooll         DDeessccrriippttiioonn
                The position of a viewed object or the adjustment of an optical

                controls the amount of light passing through the lens. Aperture

                blur. The focal length divided by the f-number gives the
                effective aperture diameter.
                Adjustment of the speed (often expressed either as fractions of
                seconds or as an angle, with mechanical shutters) of the
                shutter to control the amount of time during which the imaging
_S_h_u_t_t_e_r_ _s_p_e_e_d   medium is exposed to light for each exposure. Shutter speed may
                be used to control the amount of light striking the image
                plane; 'faster' shutter speeds (that is, those of shorter
                duration) decrease both the amount of light and the amount of
                image blurring from motion of the subject and/or camera.

                _t_e_m_p_e_r_a_t_u_r_e associated with a given set of lighting conditions,
                ensuring that white light is registered as such on the imaging
                chip and therefore that the colors in the frame will appear
                natural. On mechanical, film-based cameras, this function is
_W_h_i_t_e_ _b_a_l_a_n_c_e   served by the operator's choice of _f_i_l_m_ _s_t_o_c_k or with color
                correction filters. In addition to using white balance to
                register natural coloration of the image, photographers may
                employ white balance to aesthetic end, for example white
                balancing to a blue object in order to obtain a warm _c_o_l_o_r

                Measurement of exposure so that highlights and shadows are
                exposed according to the photographer's wishes. Many modern
                cameras meter and set exposure automatically. Before automatic
                exposure, correct exposure was accomplished with the use of a
_M_e_t_e_r_i_n_g        separate _l_i_g_h_t_ _m_e_t_e_r_i_n_g_ _d_e_v_i_c_e or by the photographer's
                knowledge and experience of gauging correct settings. To
                translate the amount of light into a usable aperture and
                shutter speed, the meter needs to adjust for the sensitivity of
                the film or sensor to light. This is done by setting the "film
                speed" or ISO sensitivity into the meter.
                Traditionally used to "tell the camera" the _f_i_l_m_ _s_p_e_e_d of the
                selected film on film cameras, ISO speeds are employed on
                modern digital cameras as an indication of the system's _g_a_i_n
                from light to numerical output and to control the automatic
_I_S_O_ _s_p_e_e_d       exposure system. The higher the ISO number the greater the film
                sensitivity to light, whereas with a lower ISO number, the film
                is less sensitive to light. A correct combination of ISO speed,
                aperture, and shutter speed leads to an image that is neither

Camera controls are interrelated. The total amount of light reaching the film
plane (the 'exposure') changes with the duration of exposure, aperture of the
lens, and on the effective focal length of the lens (which in variable focal
length lenses, can force a change in aperture as the lens is zoomed). Changing
any of these controls can alter the exposure. Many cameras may be set to adjust
most or all of these controls automatically. This automatic functionality is
useful for occasional photographers in many situations.
The duration of an exposure is referred to as shutter speed, often even in
cameras that do not have a physical shutter, and is typically measured in
fractions of a second. It is quite possible to have exposures from one up to
several seconds, usually for still-life subjects, and for night scenes exposure
times can be several hours.
The effective aperture is expressed by an f-number or f-stop (derived from
focal ratio), which is proportional to the ratio of the focal length to the
diameter of the aperture. Longer lenses will pass less light even though the
diameter of the aperture is the same due to the greater distance the light has
to travel; shorter lenses (a shorter focal length) will be brighter with the
same size of aperture.
The smaller the f/number, the larger the effective aperture. The present system
of f/numbers to give the effective aperture of a lens was standardized by an
international convention. There were earlier, different series of numbers in
older cameras.
If the f-number is decreased by a factor of [\sqrt 2], the aperture diameter is
increased by the same factor, and its area is increased by a factor of 2. The
f-stops that might be found on a typical lens include 2.8, 4, 5.6, 8, 11, 16,
22, 32, where going up "one stop" (using lower f-stop numbers) doubles the
amount of light reaching the film, and _s_t_o_p_p_i_n_g_ _d_o_w_n one stop halves the amount
of light.
Image capture can be achieved through various combinations of shutter speed,
aperture, and film or sensor speed. Different (but related) settings of
aperture and shutter speed enable photographs to be taken under various
conditions of film or sensor speed, lighting and motion of subjects and/or
camera, and desired depth of field. A slower speed film will exhibit less
"grain", and a slower speed setting on an electronic sensor will exhibit less
"noise", while higher film and sensor speeds allow for a faster shutter speed,
which reduces motion blur or allows the use of a smaller aperture to increase
the depth of field.
For example, a wider aperture is used for lower light and a lower aperture for
more light. If a subject is in motion, then a high shutter speed may be needed.
A _t_r_i_p_o_d can also be helpful in that it enables a slower shutter speed to be
used.
For example, f/8 at 8 ms (1/125 of a second) and f/5.6 at 4 ms (1/250 of a
second) yield the same amount of light. The chosen combination has an impact on
the final result. The aperture and focal length of the lens determine the _d_e_p_t_h
_o_f_ _f_i_e_l_d, which refers to the range of distances from the lens that will be in
focus. A longer lens or a wider aperture will result in "shallow" depth of
field (i.e. only a small plane of the image will be in sharp focus). This is
often useful for isolating subjects from backgrounds as in individual portraits
or macro photography.
Conversely, a shorter lens, or a smaller aperture, will result in more of the
image being in focus. This is generally more desirable when photographing
landscapes or groups of people. With very small apertures, such as _p_i_n_h_o_l_e_s, a
wide range of distance can be brought into focus, but sharpness is severely
degraded by _d_i_f_f_r_a_c_t_i_o_n with such small apertures. Generally, the highest
degree of "sharpness" is achieved at an aperture near the middle of a lens's
range (for example, f/8 for a lens with available apertures of f/2.8 to f/16).
However, as lens technology improves, lenses are becoming capable of making
increasingly sharp images at wider apertures.
Image capture is only part of the image forming process. Regardless of
material, some process must be employed to render the latent image captured by
the camera into a viewable image. With slide film, the developed film is just
mounted for _p_r_o_j_e_c_t_i_o_n. Print film requires the developed film negative to be
printed onto _p_h_o_t_o_g_r_a_p_h_i_c_ _p_a_p_e_r or _t_r_a_n_s_p_a_r_e_n_c_y. Digital images may be uploaded
to an image server (e.g., a _p_h_o_t_o_-_s_h_a_r_i_n_g web site), viewed on a _t_e_l_e_v_i_s_i_o_n, or
transferred to a _c_o_m_p_u_t_e_r or _d_i_g_i_t_a_l_ _p_h_o_t_o_ _f_r_a_m_e. Every type can be printed on

examples.

Prior to the rendering of a viewable image, modifications can be made using
several controls. Many of these controls are similar to controls during image
capture, while some are exclusive to the rendering process. Most printing
controls have equivalent digital concepts, but some create different effects.
For example, _d_o_d_g_i_n_g_ _a_n_d_ _b_u_r_n_i_n_g controls are different between digital and
film processes. Other printing modifications include:

Photographs, both monochrome and color, can be captured and displayed through
two side-by-side images that emulate human stereoscopic vision. While known
colloquially as "3-D" photography, the more accurate term is _s_t_e_r_e_o_s_c_o_p_y. Such
cameras have long been realized by using film, and more recently in digital

_U_l_t_r_a_v_i_o_l_e_t and _i_n_f_r_a_r_e_d films have been available for many decades and
employed in a variety of photographic avenues since the 1960s. New

_s_p_e_c_t_r_u_m_ _p_h_o_t_o_g_r_a_p_h_y, where careful filtering choices across the ultraviolet,
visible and infrared lead to new artistic visions.
Modified digital cameras can detect some ultraviolet, all of the visible and
much of the near infrared spectrum, as most digital imaging sensors are
sensitive from about 350 nm to 1000 nm. An off-the-shelf digital camera
contains an infrared _h_o_t_ _m_i_r_r_o_r filter that blocks most of the infrared and a
bit of the ultraviolet that would otherwise be detected by the sensor,
narrowing the accepted range from about 400 nm to 700 nm._[_2_5_]
Replacing a hot mirror or infrared blocking filter with an infrared pass or a
wide spectrally transmitting filter allows the camera to detect the wider
spectrum light at greater sensitivity. Without the hot-mirror, the red, green
and blue (or cyan, yellow and magenta) colored micro-filters placed over the
sensor elements pass varying amounts of ultraviolet (blue window) and infrared
(primarily red and somewhat lesser the green and blue micro-filters).

Digital methods of image capture and display processing have enabled the new
technology of "light field photography" (also known as synthetic aperture
photography). This process allows focusing at various depths of field to be
selected after the photograph has been captured._[_2_6_] As explained by _M_i_c_h_a_e_l
_F_a_r_a_d_a_y in 1846, the "_l_i_g_h_t_ _f_i_e_l_d" is understood as 5-dimensional, with each
point in 3-d space having attributes of two more angles that define the
direction of each ray passing through that point.
These additional vector attributes can be captured optically through the use of
microlenses at each pixel-point within the 2-dimensional image sensor. Every
pixel of the final image is actually a selection from each sub-array located
under each microlens, as identified by a post-image capture focus algorithm.

Besides the camera, other methods of forming images with light are available.
For instance, a _p_h_o_t_o_c_o_p_y or _x_e_r_o_g_r_a_p_h_y machine forms permanent images but uses
the transfer of static _e_l_e_c_t_r_i_c_a_l_ _c_h_a_r_g_e_s rather than photographic film, hence
the term _e_l_e_c_t_r_o_p_h_o_t_o_g_r_a_p_h_y. _P_h_o_t_o_g_r_a_m_s are images produced by the shadows of
objects cast on the photographic paper, without the use of a camera. Objects
can also be placed directly on the glass of an _i_m_a_g_e_ _s_c_a_n_n_e_r to produce digital
pictures.

Commercial photography is probably best defined as any photography for which
the photographer is paid for _i_m_a_g_e_s rather than _w_o_r_k_s_ _o_f_ _a_r_t. In this light,
money could be paid for the subject of the photograph or the photograph itself.
Wholesale, retail, and professional uses of photography would fall under this
definition. The commercial photographic world could include:
    * Advertising photography: photographs made to illustrate and usually sell
      a service or product. These images, such as _p_a_c_k_s_h_o_t_s, are generally done

the _U_n_i_t_e_d_ _S_t_a_t_e_s, a handful of photographers, including _A_l_f_r_e_d_ _S_t_i_e_g_l_i_t_z,
_E_d_w_a_r_d_ _S_t_e_i_c_h_e_n, _J_o_h_n_ _S_z_a_r_k_o_w_s_k_i, _F_._ _H_o_l_l_a_n_d_ _D_a_y, and _E_d_w_a_r_d_ _W_e_s_t_o_n, spent
their lives advocating for photography as a fine art. At first, fine art
photographers tried to imitate painting styles. This movement is called
_P_i_c_t_o_r_i_a_l_i_s_m, often using _s_o_f_t_ _f_o_c_u_s for a dreamy, 'romantic' look. In reaction
to that, Weston, _A_n_s_e_l_ _A_d_a_m_s, and others formed the _G_r_o_u_p_ _f_/_6_4 to advocate
'_s_t_r_a_i_g_h_t_ _p_h_o_t_o_g_r_a_p_h_y', the photograph as a (sharply focused) thing in itself
and not an imitation of something else.
The _a_e_s_t_h_e_t_i_c_s of photography is a matter that continues to be discussed
regularly, especially in artistic circles. Many artists argued that photography
was the mechanical reproduction of an image. If photography is authentically
art, then photography in the context of art would need redefinition, such as
determining what component of a photograph makes it _b_e_a_u_t_i_f_u_l to the viewer.
The controversy began with the earliest images "written with light"; _N_i_c_√_©_p_h_o_r_e
_N_i_√_©_p_c_e, _L_o_u_i_s_ _D_a_g_u_e_r_r_e, and others among the very earliest photographers were
met with acclaim, but some questioned if their work met the definitions and
purposes of art.
_C_l_i_v_e_ _B_e_l_l in his classic essay Art states that only "significant form" can
distinguish art from what is not art.
     There must be some one quality without which a work of art cannot
     exist; possessing which, in the least degree, no work is altogether
     worthless. What is this quality? What quality is shared by all
     objects that provoke our aesthetic emotions? What quality is common
     to Sta. Sophia and the windows at Chartres, Mexican sculpture, a
     Persian bowl, Chinese carpets, Giotto's frescoes at Padua, and the
     masterpieces of Poussin, Piero della Francesca, and Cezanne? Only one
     answer seems possible ‚Äî significant form. In each, lines and colors
     combined in a particular way, certain forms and relations of forms,
     stir our aesthetic emotions.

The camera has a long and distinguished history as a means of recording
phenomena from the first use by Daguerre and Fox-Talbot, such as astronomical
events (_e_c_l_i_p_s_e_s for example), small creatures and plants when the camera was
attached to the eyepiece of microscopes (in _p_h_o_t_o_m_i_c_r_o_s_c_o_p_y) and for _m_a_c_r_o
_p_h_o_t_o_g_r_a_p_h_y of larger specimens. The camera also proved useful in recording
_c_r_i_m_e_ _s_c_e_n_e_s and the scenes of accidents, such as the _W_o_o_t_t_o_n_ _b_r_i_d_g_e_ _c_o_l_l_a_p_s_e
in 1861. The methods used in analysing photographs for use in legal cases are
collectively known as _f_o_r_e_n_s_i_c_ _p_h_o_t_o_g_r_a_p_h_y.
By 1853, _C_h_a_r_l_e_s_ _B_r_o_o_k_e had invented a technology for the _a_u_t_o_m_a_t_i_c

_b_a_r_o_m_e_t_e_r_s, _t_h_e_r_m_o_m_e_t_e_r_s, _p_s_y_c_h_r_o_m_e_t_e_r_s, and _m_a_g_n_e_t_o_m_e_t_e_r_s, which recorded
their readings by means of an _a_u_t_o_m_a_t_e_d _p_h_o_t_o_g_r_a_p_h_i_c process._[_3_4_]
Photography has become ubiquitous in recording events and data in science and
engineering, and at _c_r_i_m_e_ _s_c_e_n_e_s or accident scenes. The method has been much
extended by using other wavelengths, such as _i_n_f_r_a_r_e_d_ _p_h_o_t_o_g_r_a_p_h_y and

in the _V_i_c_t_o_r_i_a_n_ _e_r_a and developed much further since that time._[_3_5_]

There are many ongoing questions about different aspects of photography. In her
writing "On Photography" (1977), _S_u_s_a_n_ _S_o_n_t_a_g discusses concerns about the
objectivity of photography. This is a highly debated subject within the
photographic community._[_3_6_] Sontag argues, "To photograph is to appropriate the
thing photographed. It means putting one‚Äôs self into a certain relation to
the world that feels like knowledge, and therefore like power."_[_3_7_]
Photographers decide what to take a photo of, what elements to exclude and what
angle to frame the photo, and these factors may reflect a particular socio-
historical context. Along these lines it can be argued that photography is a
subjective form of representation.
Modern photography has raised a number of concerns on its impact on society. In
_A_l_f_r_e_d_ _H_i_t_c_h_c_o_c_k's _R_e_a_r_ _W_i_n_d_o_w (1954), the camera is presented as promoting
voyeurism. 'Although the camera is an observation station, the act of
photographing is more than passive observing'._[_3_7_] Michal Powell's Peeping Tom
(1960) portrays the camera as both sexual and sadistically violent technology
that literally kills in this picture and at the same time captures images of
the pain and anguish evident on the faces of the female victims.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n
_n_e_e_d_e_d]
     "The camera doesn't rape or even possess, though it may presume,
     intrude, trespass, distort, exploit, and, at the farthest reach of
     metaphor, assassinate - all activities that, unlike the sexual push
     and shove, can be conducted from a distance, and with some
     detachment."_[_3_7_]
Digital imaging has raised ethical concerns because of the ease of manipulating
digital photographs in post-processing. Many photojournalists have declared
they will not _c_r_o_p their pictures, or are forbidden from combining elements of
multiple photos to make "_p_h_o_t_o_m_o_n_t_a_g_e_s", passing them as "real" photographs.
Today's technology has made _i_m_a_g_e_ _e_d_i_t_i_n_g relatively simple for even the novice
photographer. However, recent changes of in-camera processing allows digital
fingerprinting of photos to detect tampering for purposes of _f_o_r_e_n_s_i_c
_p_h_o_t_o_g_r_a_p_h_y.
Photography is one of the new media forms that changes perception and changes
the structure of society._[_3_8_] Further unease has been caused around cameras in
regards to desensitization. Fears that disturbing or explicit images are widely
accessible to children and society at large have been raised. Particularly,
photos of war and pornography are causing a stir. Sontag is concerned that "to
photograph is to turn people into objects that can be symbolically possessed."
Desensitization discussion goes hand in hand with debates about censored
images. Sontag writes of her concern that the ability to censor pictures means
the photographer has the ability to construct reality._[_3_7_]
One of the practices through which photography constitutes society is _t_o_u_r_i_s_m.
Tourism and photography combine to create a "tourist gaze"_[_3_9_] in which local
inhabitants are positioned and defined by the camera lens. However, it has also
been argued that there exists a "reverse gaze"_[_4_0_] through which indigenous
photographees can position the tourist photographer as a shallow consumer of
images.
Additionally, photography has been the topic of _m_a_n_y_ _s_o_n_g_s in popular culture.

Photography is both restricted as well as protected by the law in many
jurisdictions. Protection of photographs is typically achieved through the
granting of _c_o_p_y_r_i_g_h_t or moral rights to the photographer. In the UK a recent
law (Counter-Terrorism Act 2008) increases the power of the police to prevent
