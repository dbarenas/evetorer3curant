Household items made of various types of plastic
A ppllaassttiicc material is any of a wide range of _s_y_n_t_h_e_t_i_c or semi-synthetic
_o_r_g_a_n_i_c solids that are _m_o_l_d_a_b_l_e. Plastics are typically _o_r_g_a_n_i_c_ _p_o_l_y_m_e_r_s of
high _m_o_l_e_c_u_l_a_r_ _m_a_s_s, but they often contain other substances. They are usually
synthetic, most commonly derived from _p_e_t_r_o_c_h_e_m_i_c_a_l_s, but many are partially
natural._[_1_]
IUPAC definition
Generic term used in the case of polymeric material that may contain other
substances
to improve performance and/or reduce costs.
Note 1: The use of this term instead of _p_o_l_y_m_e_r is a source of confusion and
thus is
not recommended.
Note 2: This term is used in polymer engineering for materials often compounded
that
can be processed by flow._[_2_]

Most plastics contain _o_r_g_a_n_i_c polymers. The vast majority of these polymers are
based on chains of _c_a_r_b_o_n atoms alone or with _o_x_y_g_e_n, _s_u_l_f_u_r, or _n_i_t_r_o_g_e_n as
well. The backbone is that part of the chain on the main "path" linking a large
number of repeat units together. To customize the properties of a plastic,
different molecular groups "hang" from the backbone (usually they are "hung" as
part of the monomers before the monomers are linked together to form the
polymer chain). The structure of these "side chains" influence the properties
of the polymer. This fine tuning of the properties of the polymer by repeating
unit's molecular structure has allowed plastics to become an indispensable part
of the twenty-first century world.

Most plastics contain other organic or _i_n_o_r_g_a_n_i_c_ _c_o_m_p_o_u_n_d_s blended in. The
amount of additives ranges from zero percentage for polymers used to wrap foods
to more than 50% for certain electronic applications. The average content of
additives is 20% by weight of the polymer. _F_i_l_l_e_r_s improve performance and/or
reduce production costs. _S_t_a_b_i_l_i_z_i_n_g_ _a_d_d_i_t_i_v_e_s include _f_i_r_e_ _r_e_t_a_r_d_a_n_t_s to lower
the flammability of the material. Many plastics contain fillers, relatively
inert and inexpensive materials that make the product cheaper by weight.
Typically fillers are mineral in origin, e.g., _c_h_a_l_k. Some fillers are more
chemically active and are called reinforcing agents. Since many organic
polymers are too rigid for particular applications, they are blended with
_p_l_a_s_t_i_c_i_z_e_r_s (the largest group of additives_[_3_]), oily compounds that confer
improved _r_h_e_o_l_o_g_y. Colorants are common additives, although their weight
contribution is small. Many of the controversies associated with plastics are
associated with the additives._[_4_] _O_r_g_a_n_o_t_i_n_ _c_o_m_p_o_u_n_d_s are particularly toxic_[_3_]

backbone and _s_i_d_e_ _c_h_a_i_n_s. Some important groups in these classifications are
the _a_c_r_y_l_i_c_s, _p_o_l_y_e_s_t_e_r_s, _s_i_l_i_c_o_n_e_s, _p_o_l_y_u_r_e_t_h_a_n_e_s, and _h_a_l_o_g_e_n_a_t_e_d_ _p_l_a_s_t_i_c_s.
Plastics can also be classified by the chemical process used in their
synthesis, such as _c_o_n_d_e_n_s_a_t_i_o_n, _p_o_l_y_a_d_d_i_t_i_o_n, and _c_r_o_s_s_-_l_i_n_k_i_n_g._[_5_]

There are two types of plastics: _t_h_e_r_m_o_p_l_a_s_t_i_c_s and _t_h_e_r_m_o_s_e_t_t_i_n_g_ _p_o_l_y_m_e_r_s.
Thermoplastics are the plastics that do not undergo chemical change in their
composition when heated and can be molded again and again. Examples include
_p_o_l_y_e_t_h_y_l_e_n_e, _p_o_l_y_p_r_o_p_y_l_e_n_e, _p_o_l_y_s_t_y_r_e_n_e and _p_o_l_y_v_i_n_y_l_ _c_h_l_o_r_i_d_e._[_6_] Common
thermoplastics range from 20,000 to 500,000 _a_m_u, while thermosets are assumed
to have infinite molecular weight. These chains are made up of many repeating
molecular units, known as repeat units, derived from _m_o_n_o_m_e_r_s; each polymer
chain will have several thousand repeating units.
Thermosets can melt and take shape once; after they have solidified, they stay
solid. In the thermosetting process, a chemical reaction occurs that is
irreversible. The vulcanization of rubber is a thermosetting process. Before
heating with sulfur, the polyisoprene is a tacky, slightly runny material, but
after vulcanization the product is rigid and non-tacky.

In 1600 BC, Mesoamericans used natural rubber for balls, bands, and figurines.
_[_1_1_] Early plastics were bio-derived materials such as egg and blood proteins,
which are organic polymers. Treated cattle horns were used as windows for
lanterns in the Middle Ages. Materials that mimicked the properties of horns
were developed by treating milk-proteins (_c_a_s_e_i_n) with lye. In the 1800s, the
development of plastics accelerated with _C_h_a_r_l_e_s_ _G_o_o_d_y_e_a_r's discovery of
_v_u_l_c_a_n_i_z_a_t_i_o_n as a route to thermoset materials derived from natural rubber.
Many storied materials were reported as industrial chemistry was developed in
the 1800s. In the early 1900s, _B_a_k_e_l_i_t_e, the first fully synthetic thermoset
was reported by Belgian chemist _L_e_o_ _B_a_e_k_e_l_a_n_d. In 1933, _p_o_l_y_e_t_h_y_l_e_n_e was

electric motors and generators. He found that combining phenol (C6H5OH) and
formaldehyde (HCOH) formed a sticky mass and later found that the material
could be mixed with wood flour, asbestos, or slate dust to create strong and
fire resistant "composite" materials. The new material tended to foam during
synthesis, requiring that Baekeland build pressure vessels to force out the
bubbles and provide a smooth, uniform product, as he announced in 1909, in a
meeting of the American Chemical Society._[_1_6_] Bakelite was originally used for
electrical and mechanical parts, coming into widespread use in consumer goods
and jewelry in the 1920s. Bakelite was a purely synthetic material, not derived
from living matter. It was also an early thermosetting plastic.

Polystyrene is a rigid, brittle, inexpensive plastic that has been used to make
_p_l_a_s_t_i_c_ _m_o_d_e_l kits and similar knick-knacks. It would also be the basis for one
of the most popular "foamed" plastics, under the name styrene foam or
_S_t_y_r_o_f_o_a_m. Foam plastics can be synthesized in an "open cell" form, in which
the foam bubbles are interconnected, as in an absorbent sponge, and "closed
cell", in which all the bubbles are distinct, like tiny balloons, as in gas-
filled foam insulation and flotation devices. In the late 1950s, high impact
styrene was introduced, which was not brittle. It finds much current use as the
substance of toy figurines and novelties.

Polyvinyl chloride (PVC, commonly called "vinyl")_[_1_7_] incorporates chlorine
atoms. The C-Cl bonds in the backbone are hydrophobic and resist oxidation (and
burning). PVC is stiff, strong, heat and weather resistant, properties that
recommend its use in devices for _p_l_u_m_b_i_n_g, gutters, house siding, enclosures
for computers and other electronics gear. PVC can also be softened with
chemical processing, and in this form it is now used for _s_h_r_i_n_k_-_w_r_a_p, food
packaging, and rain gear.
Vinylchloride polymerization
All PVC polymers are degraded by heat and light. When this happens, hydrogen
chloride is released into the atmosphere and oxidation of the compound occurs.
_[_1_8_] Because hydrogen chloride readily combines with water vapor in the air to
form hydrochloric acid,_[_1_9_] polyvinyl chloride is not recommended for long-term
archival storage of silver, photographic film or paper (_m_y_l_a_r is preferable).

The plastics industry was revolutionized in the 1930s with the announcement of
_p_o_l_y_a_m_i_d_e (PA), far better known by its trade name nnyylloonn. Nylon was the first
purely synthetic fiber, introduced by _D_u_P_o_n_t_ _C_o_r_p_o_r_a_t_i_o_n at the _1_9_3_9_ _W_o_r_l_d_'_s

In 1927, DuPont had begun a secret development project designated Fiber66,
under the direction of Harvard chemist _W_a_l_l_a_c_e_ _C_a_r_o_t_h_e_r_s and chemistry
department director _E_l_m_e_r_ _K_e_i_s_e_r_ _B_o_l_t_o_n. Carothers had been hired to perform
pure research, and he worked to understand the new materials' molecular
structure and physical properties. He took some of the first steps in the
molecular design of the materials.
His work led to the discovery of synthetic nylon fiber, which was very strong
but also very flexible. The first application was for bristles for
_t_o_o_t_h_b_r_u_s_h_e_s. However, Du Pont's real target was _s_i_l_k, particularly silk
_s_t_o_c_k_i_n_g_s. Carothers and his team synthesized a number of different polyamides
including polyamide 6.6 and 4.6, as well as polyesters._[_2_1_]
General condensation polymerization reaction for nylon
It took DuPont twelve years and US$27 million to refine nylon, and to
synthesize and develop the industrial processes for bulk manufacture. With such
a major investment, it was no surprise that Du Pont spared little expense to
promote nylon after its introduction, creating a public sensation, or "nylon
mania".
Nylon mania came to an abrupt stop at the end of 1941 when the USA entered
_W_o_r_l_d_ _W_a_r_ _I_I. The production capacity that had been built up to produce _n_y_l_o_n
_s_t_o_c_k_i_n_g_s, or just nylons, for American women was taken over to manufacture
vast numbers of parachutes for fliers and paratroopers. After the war ended,
DuPont went back to selling nylon to the public, engaging in another
promotional campaign in 1946 that resulted in an even bigger craze, triggering
the so-called _n_y_l_o_n_ _r_i_o_t_s.
Subsequently polyamides 6, 10, 11, and 12 have been developed based on monomers
which are ring compounds; e.g. _c_a_p_r_o_l_a_c_t_a_m. Nylon 66 is a material manufactured
by _c_o_n_d_e_n_s_a_t_i_o_n_ _p_o_l_y_m_e_r_i_z_a_t_i_o_n.
Nylons still remain important plastics, and not just for use in fabrics. In its
bulk form it is very wear resistant, particularly if oil-impregnated, and so is
used to build gears, _p_l_a_i_n_ _b_e_a_r_i_n_g_s, valve seats, seals and because of good
heat-resistance, increasingly for under-the-hood applications in cars, and
other mechanical parts.

The properties of plastics are defined chiefly by the organic chemistry of the

Pure plastics have low toxicity due to their insolubility in water and because
they are biochemically inert, due to a large molecular weight. Plastic products
contain a variety of additives, some of which can be toxic. For example,
_p_l_a_s_t_i_c_i_z_e_r_s like _a_d_i_p_a_t_e_s and _p_h_t_h_a_l_a_t_e_s are often added to brittle plastics
like polyvinyl chloride to make them pliable enough for use in food packaging,
_t_o_y_s, and many other items. Traces of these compounds can leach out of the
product. Owing to concerns over the effects of such leachates, the _E_u_r_o_p_e_a_n
_U_n_i_o_n has restricted the use of _D_E_H_P (di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate) and other
phthalates in some applications. Some compounds leaching from polystyrene food
containers have been proposed to interfere with hormone functions and are
suspected human carcinogens._[_2_4_] Other chemicals of potential concern include
_a_l_k_y_l_p_h_e_n_o_l_s._[_3_]
Whereas the finished plastic may be non-toxic, the monomers used in the
manufacture of the parent polymers may be toxic. In some cases, small amounts
of those chemicals can remain trapped in the product unless suitable processing
is employed. For example, the _W_o_r_l_d_ _H_e_a_l_t_h_ _O_r_g_a_n_i_z_a_t_i_o_n's _I_n_t_e_r_n_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _A_g_e_n_c_y

Plastics are durable and _d_e_g_r_a_d_e very slowly; the chemical bonds that make
plastic so durable make it equally resistant to natural processes of
degradation. Since the 1950s, one billion tons of plastic have been discarded
and may persist for hundreds or even thousands of years._[_3_0_] Serious
environmental threats from plastic include the increasing presence of
_m_i_c_r_o_p_l_a_s_t_i_c_s in the marine food chain along with the many other highly toxic
chemical pollutants that plastic attracts and concentrates, and larger
fragmented pieces of plastic called nurdles._[_3_1_] In the 1960s the latter were
observed in the guts of seabirds, and since then have been found in increasing
concentration._[_3_2_] In 2009, it was estimated that 10% of modern waste was
plastics,_[_1_2_] although estimates vary according to region._[_3_2_] Meanwhile, 50-
80% of debris in marine areas is plastic._[_3_2_]

The effect of plastics on global warming is mixed. Plastics are generally made
from petroleum. If the plastic is incinerated, it increases carbon emissions;
if it is placed in a landfill, it becomes a carbon sink_[_3_3_] although
biodegradable plastics have caused methane emissions._[_3_4_] Due to the lightness
of plastic versus glass or metal, plastic may reduce energy consumption. For
example, packaging beverages in PET plastic rather than glass or metal is
estimated to save 52% in transportation energy._[_1_1_]

Production of plastics from crude oil requires 62 to 108 _M_J of energy per
kilogram (taking into account the average efficiency of US utility stations of
35%). Producing silicon and semiconductors for modern electronic equipment is
even more energy consuming: 230 to 235 MJ per 1 kilogram of silicon, and about
3,000 MJ per kilogram of semiconductors._[_3_5_] This is much higher, compared to
many other materials, e.g. production of iron from iron ore requires 20-25 MJ
of energy, glass (from sand, etc.) - 18-35 MJ, steel (from iron) - 20-50 MJ,
paper (from timber) - 25-50 MJ per kilogram._[_3_6_]

uncontrolled incineration of plastic produces polychlorinated dibenzo-p-

Thermoplastics can be remelted and reused, and thermoset plastics can be ground
up and used as filler, although the purity of the material tends to degrade
with each reuse cycle. There are methods by which plastics can be broken back
down to a feedstock state.
The greatest challenge to the recycling of plastics is the difficulty of
automating the sorting of plastic wastes, making it _l_a_b_o_r_ _i_n_t_e_n_s_i_v_e. Typically,
workers sort the plastic by looking at the resin identification code, although
common containers like soda bottles can be sorted from memory. Typically, the
caps for PETE bottles are made from a different kind of plastic which is not
recyclable, which presents additional problems to the automated sorting
process. Other recyclable materials such as metals are easier to process
mechanically. However, new processes of mechanical sorting are being developed
to increase capacity and efficiency of plastic recycling.
While containers are usually made from a single type and color of plastic,
making them relatively easy to be sorted, a consumer product like a cellular
phone may have many small parts consisting of over a dozen different types and
colors of plastics. In such cases, the resources it would take to separate the
plastics far exceed their value and the item is discarded. However,
developments are taking place in the field of _a_c_t_i_v_e_ _d_i_s_a_s_s_e_m_b_l_y, which may
result in more consumer product components being re-used or recycled. Recycling
certain types of plastics can be unprofitable, as well. For example,
polystyrene is rarely recycled because it is usually not cost effective. These
unrecycled wastes are typically disposed of in _l_a_n_d_f_i_l_l_s, _i_n_c_i_n_e_r_a_t_e_d or used
to produce electricity at _w_a_s_t_e_-_t_o_-_e_n_e_r_g_y plants.
A first success in recycling of plastics is _V_i_n_y_l_o_o_p, a recycling process and
an approach of the industry to separate PVC from other materials through a
process of dissolution, filtration and separation of contaminations. A solvent
is used in a closed loop to elute PVC from the waste. This makes it possible to
recycle composite structure PVC waste which normally is being incinerated or
put in a landfill. Vinyloop-based recycled PVC's primary energy demand is 46
percent lower than conventional produced PVC. The global warming potential is
39 percent lower. This is why the use of recycled material leads to a
significant better ecological footprint._[_4_0_] This process was used after the
_O_l_y_m_p_i_c_ _G_a_m_e_s in London 2012. Parts of temporary Buildings like the _W_a_t_e_r_ _P_o_l_o
_A_r_e_n_a or the _R_o_y_a_l_ _A_r_t_i_l_l_e_r_y_ _B_a_r_r_a_c_k_s were recycled. This way, the PVC Policy
could be fulfilled which says that no PVC waste should be left after the games.

Due to their relatively low cost, ease of manufacture, versatility, and
imperviousness to water, plastics are used in an enormous and expanding range
of products, from paper clips to spaceships. They have already displaced many
traditional materials, such as _w_o_o_d, _s_t_o_n_e, _h_o_r_n and _b_o_n_e, _l_e_a_t_h_e_r, _p_a_p_e_r,
_m_e_t_a_l, _g_l_a_s_s, and _c_e_r_a_m_i_c, in most of their former uses.
In developed countries, about a third of plastic is used in packaging and
another third in buildings such as _p_i_p_i_n_g used in _p_l_u_m_b_i_n_g or _v_i_n_y_l_ _s_i_d_i_n_g._[_1_1_]
Other uses include automobiles (up to 20% plastic_[_1_1_]), furniture, and toys.
_[_1_1_] In the developing world, the ratios may be different - for example,
reportedly 42% of India's consumption is used in packaging._[_1_1_]

meaning molded._[_4_3_]_[_4_4_] It refers to their malleability, or _p_l_a_s_t_i_c_i_t_y during
manufacture, that allows them to be _c_a_s_t, _p_r_e_s_s_e_d, or _e_x_t_r_u_d_e_d into a variety
of shapesâ€”such as _f_i_l_m_s, _f_i_b_e_r_s, plates, tubes, bottles, boxes, and much
more.
The common word plastic should not be confused with the technical adjective
plastic, which is applied to any material which undergoes a permanent change of
shape (_p_l_a_s_t_i_c_ _d_e_f_o_r_m_a_t_i_o_n) when strained beyond a certain point. _A_l_u_m_i_n_u_m
which is stamped or forged, for instance, exhibits plasticity in this sense,
but is not plastic in the common sense; in contrast, in their finished forms,
some plastics will break before deforming and therefore are not plastic in the
technical sense.
