PPuubblliisshhiinngg is the process of production and _d_i_s_s_e_m_i_n_a_t_i_o_n of _l_i_t_e_r_a_t_u_r_e, _m_u_s_i_c,
or _i_n_f_o_r_m_a_t_i_o_n â€” the activity of making information available to the general
public. In some cases, authors may be their own publishers, meaning:
originators and developers of _c_o_n_t_e_n_t also provide _m_e_d_i_a to deliver and display
the content for the same. Also, the word publisher can refer to the individual
who leads a publishing company or _i_m_p_r_i_n_t or to a person who owns a magazine.
Traditionally, the term refers to the distribution of printed works such as
books (the "book trade") and _n_e_w_s_p_a_p_e_r_s. With the advent of digital information
systems and the _I_n_t_e_r_n_e_t, the scope of publishing has expanded to include
electronic resources, such as the electronic versions of books and periodicals,
as well as _m_i_c_r_o_p_u_b_l_i_s_h_i_n_g, _w_e_b_s_i_t_e_s, _b_l_o_g_s, _v_i_d_e_o_ _g_a_m_e_ _p_u_b_l_i_s_h_e_r_s and the
like.
Publishing includes the stages of the development, acquisition, copy-editing,
graphic design, production â€“ _p_r_i_n_t_i_n_g (and its _e_l_e_c_t_r_o_n_i_c_ _e_q_u_i_v_a_l_e_n_t_s), and
_m_a_r_k_e_t_i_n_g and _d_i_s_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_o_n of newspapers, magazines, books, _l_i_t_e_r_a_r_y_ _w_o_r_k_s,
_m_u_s_i_c_a_l_ _w_o_r_k_s, _s_o_f_t_w_a_r_e and other works dealing with information, including the
_e_l_e_c_t_r_o_n_i_c_ _m_e_d_i_a.(c)
_P_u_b_l_i_c_a_t_i_o_n is also important as a _l_e_g_a_l_ _c_o_n_c_e_p_t:
   1. As the process of giving formal notice to the world of a significant
      intention, for example, to _m_a_r_r_y or enter _b_a_n_k_r_u_p_t_c_y;
   2. As the essential precondition of being able to claim _d_e_f_a_m_a_t_i_o_n; that is,
      the alleged _l_i_b_e_l must have been published, and
   3. For _c_o_p_y_r_i_g_h_t purposes, where there is a difference in the protection of
      _p_u_b_l_i_s_h_e_d and unpublished works.
There are three different categories in which publication house can be divided
   1. Non-Paid Publishers : The term non-paid publisher refers to those
      publication houses which do not charge author at all to publish the book.
   2. Semi-Paid Publishers : Publication houses that charge partially the
      author in order to meet the expenses of the book. Author has full right
      to claim 50% of the copies printed in case author has met with the burden
      of paying 50% of the total amount to get the books published.
   3. Paid Publishers : These days paid publication has become very common,
      here the author has to meet with the total expense to get the book
      published and author has full right to set up marketing policies.

Book and magazine publishers spend a lot of their time buying or commissioning
copy; newspaper publishers, by contrast, usually hire their own staff to
produce copy, although they may also employ freelance journalists, called
_s_t_r_i_n_g_e_r_s. At a small press, it is possible to survive by relying entirely on
commissioned material. But as activity increases, the need for works may
outstrip the publisher's established circle of writers.
For works written independently of the publisher, writers often first submit a
query letter or proposal directly to a _l_i_t_e_r_a_r_y_ _a_g_e_n_t or to a publisher.
Submissions sent directly to a publisher are referred to as unsolicited
submissions, and the majority come from previously unpublished authors. If the
publisher accepts unsolicited manuscripts, then the manuscript is placed in the
_s_l_u_s_h_ _p_i_l_e, which _p_u_b_l_i_s_h_e_r_'_s_ _r_e_a_d_e_r_s sift through to identify manuscripts of
sufficient quality or revenue potential to be referred to acquisitions editors
for review. The acquisitions editors send their choices to the editorial staff.
The time and number of people involved in the process is dependent on the size
of the publishing company, with larger companies having more degrees of
assessment between unsolicited submission and publication. Unsolicited
submissions have a very low rate of acceptance, with some sources estimating
that publishers ultimately choose about three out of every ten thousand
unsolicited manuscripts they receive._[_1_]
Many book publishing companies around the world maintain a strict "no
unsolicited submissions" policy and will only accept submissions via a literary
agent. This shifts the burden of assessing and developing writers out of the
publishing company and onto the literary agents. At these companies,
unsolicited manuscripts are thrown out, or sometimes returned, if the author
has provided pre-paid postage.
Established authors are often represented by a _l_i_t_e_r_a_r_y_ _a_g_e_n_t to market their
work to publishers and negotiate contracts. Literary agents take a percentage
of author earnings (varying between 10 to 15 per cent) to pay for their
services.
Some writers follow a non-standard route to publication. For example, this may
include bloggers who have attracted large readerships producing a book based on
their websites, books based on _I_n_t_e_r_n_e_t_ _m_e_m_e_s, instant "celebrities" such as
_J_o_e_ _t_h_e_ _P_l_u_m_b_e_r, retiring sports figures and in general anyone whom a publisher
feels could produce a marketable book. Such books often employ the services of
a _g_h_o_s_t_w_r_i_t_e_r.
For a submission to reach publication it must be championed by an editor or
publisher who must work to convince other staff of the need to publish a
particular title. An editor who discovers or champions a book that subsequently
becomes a best-seller may find their own reputation enhanced as a result of
their success.

Once a work is accepted, _c_o_m_m_i_s_s_i_o_n_i_n_g_ _e_d_i_t_o_r_s negotiate the purchase of
_i_n_t_e_l_l_e_c_t_u_a_l_ _p_r_o_p_e_r_t_y rights and agree on _r_o_y_a_l_t_y rates.
The authors of traditional printed materials typically sell exclusive
territorial intellectual property rights that match the list of countries in
which distribution is proposed (i.e. the rights match the legal systems under
which copyright protections can be enforced). In the case of books, the
publisher and writer must also agree on the intended formats of publication â€”
_m_a_s_s_-_m_a_r_k_e_t_ _p_a_p_e_r_b_a_c_k, "trade" _p_a_p_e_r_b_a_c_k and _h_a_r_d_b_a_c_k are the most common
options.
The situation is slightly more complex, if electronic formatting is to be used.
Where distribution is to be by _C_D_-_R_O_M or other physical media, there is no
reason to treat this form differently from a paper format, and a national
copyright is an acceptable approach. But the possibility of Internet download
without the ability to restrict physical distribution within national
boundaries presents legal problems that are usually solved by selling language
or translation rights rather than national rights. Thus, Internet access across
the _E_u_r_o_p_e_a_n_ _U_n_i_o_n is relatively open because of the laws forbidding
discrimination based on nationality, but the fact of publication in, say,
France, limits the target market to those who read French.
Having agreed on the scope of the publication and the formats, the parties in a
book agreement must then agree on _r_o_y_a_l_t_y_ _r_a_t_e_s, the percentage of the gross
retail price that will be paid to the author, and the _a_d_v_a_n_c_e_ _p_a_y_m_e_n_t. This is
difficult because the publisher must estimate the potential sales in each
market and balance projected revenue against production costs. Royalties
usually range between 10â€“12% of recommended retail price. An advance is
usually 1/3 of first print run total royalties. For example, if a book has a
print run of 5000 copies and will be sold at $14.95 and the author is to
receive 10% royalties, the total sum payable to the author if all copies are
sold is $7475 (10% x $14.95 x 5000). The advance in this instance would roughly
be $2490. Advances vary greatly between books, with established authors
commanding large advances.

Although listed as distinct stages, parts of these occur concurrently. As

and sales and marketing of the book begins.

A decision is taken to publish a work, and the technical legal issues resolved,
the author may be asked to improve the quality of the work through rewriting or
smaller changes, and the staff will _e_d_i_t the work. Publishers may maintain a
_h_o_u_s_e_ _s_t_y_l_e, and staff will _c_o_p_y_ _e_d_i_t to ensure that the work matches the style
and grammatical requirements of each market. Editors often choose or refine
titles and headlines. Editing may also involve structural changes and requests
for more information. Some publishers employ _f_a_c_t_ _c_h_e_c_k_e_r_s, particularly
regarding non-fiction works.

When a final text is agreed upon, the next phase is _d_e_s_i_g_n. This may include
_a_r_t_w_o_r_k being commissioned or confirmation of layout. In publishing, the word
"art" also indicates photographs. Depending on the number of photographs
required by the work, photographs may also be licensed from _p_h_o_t_o_ _l_i_b_r_a_r_i_e_s.
For those works that are particularly rich in illustrations the publisher may
contract a picture researcher to find and licence the photographs required for
the work. The design process prepares the work for _p_r_i_n_t_i_n_g through processes
such as _t_y_p_e_s_e_t_t_i_n_g, dust jacket composition, specification of paper quality,
binding method and casing, and _p_r_o_o_f_r_e_a_d_i_n_g.
The type of book being produced determines the amount of design required. For
standard fiction titles, design is usually restricted to typography and cover
design. For books containing illustrations or images, design takes on a much
larger role in laying out how the page looks, how chapters begin and end,
colours, typography, cover design and ancillary materials such as posters,
catalogue images and other sales materials. Non-fiction illustrated titles are
the most design intensive books, requiring extensive use of images and
illustrations, captions, typography and a deep involvement and consideration of
the reader experience.
The activities of typesetting, page layout, the production of negatives, plates
from the negatives and, for hardbacks, the preparation of brasses for the spine
legend and _i_m_p_r_i_n_t are now all computerized. Prepress computerization evolved
mainly in about the last twenty years of the 20th century. If the work is to be
distributed electronically, the final files are saved as formats appropriate to
the target operating systems of the hardware used for reading. These may
include _P_D_F files.

The sales and marketing stage is closely intertwined with the editorial
process. As front cover images are produced or chapters are edited, sales
people may start talking about the book with their customers to build early
interest. Publishing companies often produce advanced information sheets that
may be sent to customers or overseas publishers to gauge possible sales. As
early interest is measured, this information feeds back through the editorial
process and may affect the formatting of the book and the strategy employed to
sell it. For example, if interest from foreign publishers is high, co-
publishing deals may be established whereby publishers share printing costs in
producing large print runs thereby lowering the per-unit cost of the books.
Conversely, if initial feedback is not strong, the print-run of the book may be
reduced, the marketing budget cut or, in some cases, the book is dropped from
publication altogether.

After the end of editing and design work the printing phase begins. The first
step involves the production of a _p_r_e_-_p_r_e_s_s_ _p_r_o_o_f, which the printers send for
final checking and sign-off by the publisher. This proof shows the book
precisely as it will appear once printed and represents the final opportunity
for the publisher to find and correct any errors. Some printing companies use
electronic proofs rather than printed proofs. Once the publisher has approved
the proofs, printingâ€”the physical production of the printed workâ€”begins.
A new printing process has emerged as _p_r_i_n_t_i_n_g_ _o_n_ _d_e_m_a_n_d. The book is written,
edited, and designed as usual, but it is not printed until the publisher
receives an order for the book from a customer. This procedure ensures low
costs for storage, and reduces the likelihood of printing more books than will
be sold.

In the case of books, binding follows upon the printing process. It involves
folding the printed sheets, "securing them together, affixing boards or sides
thereto, and covering the whole with leather or other materials"._[_2_]

The final stage in publication involves making the product available to the
public, usually by offering it for sale. In previous centuries, authors
frequently also acted as their own editor, printer, and bookseller, but these
functions have generally become separated. Once a book, newspaper, or other
publication is printed, the publisher may use a variety of channels to
distribute it. Books are most commonly sold through _b_o_o_k_s_e_l_l_e_r_s and through
other retailers. Newspapers and magazines are typically sold in advance
directly by the publisher to _s_u_b_s_c_r_i_b_e_r_s, and then distributed either through
the postal system or by _n_e_w_s_p_a_p_e_r_ _c_a_r_r_i_e_r_s. Periodicals are also frequently
sold through _n_e_w_s_a_g_e_n_t_s and vending machines.
Within the book industry, printers often fly some copies of the finished book
to publishers as sample copies to aid sales or to be sent out for pre-release
reviews. The remaining books often travel from the printing facility via sea
freight. Accordingly, the delay between the approval of the pre-press proof and
the arrival of books in a warehouse, much less in a retail store, can take some
months. For books that tie into movie release-dates (particularly for
_c_h_i_l_d_r_e_n_'_s_ _f_i_l_m_s), publishers will arrange books to arrive in store up to two
months prior to the movie release in order to build interest in the movie.

that cared more about profits than about literary quality,_[_3_] publishing is
fundamentally a business, with a need for the expenses of creating, producing,
and distributing a book or other publication not to exceed the income derived
from its sale. Publishing is now a major industry with the largest companies
_R_e_e_d_ _E_l_s_e_v_i_e_r and _P_e_a_r_s_o_n_ _P_L_C having global publishing operations._[_4_]
The publisher usually controls the _a_d_v_e_r_t_i_s_i_n_g and other _m_a_r_k_e_t_i_n_g tasks, but
may _s_u_b_c_o_n_t_r_a_c_t various aspects of the process to specialist publisher
marketing agencies. In many companies, editing, proofreading, layout, design
and other aspects of the production process are done by _f_r_e_e_l_a_n_c_e_r_s._[_5_]_[_6_]
Dedicated in-house salespeople are sometimes replaced by companies who
specialize in sales to bookshops, wholesalers and chain stores for a fee. This
trend is accelerating as retail book chains and supermarkets have centralized
their buying.
If the entire process up to the stage of printing is handled by an outside
company or individuals, and then sold to the publishing company, it is known as
_b_o_o_k_ _p_a_c_k_a_g_i_n_g. This is a common strategy between smaller publishers in
different territorial markets where the company that first buys the
intellectual property rights then sells a package to other publishers and gains
an immediate return on capital invested. Indeed, the first publisher will often
print sufficient copies for all markets and thereby get the maximum quantity
efficiency on the print run for all.
Some businesses maximize their profit margins through _v_e_r_t_i_c_a_l_ _i_n_t_e_g_r_a_t_i_o_n;
book publishing is not one of them. Although newspaper and magazine companies
still often own printing presses and binderies, book publishers rarely do.
Similarly, the trade usually sells the finished products through a _d_i_s_t_r_i_b_u_t_o_r
who stores and distributes the publisher's wares for a percentage fee or sells
on a sale or return basis.
The advent of the Internet has provided the electronic way of book distribution
without the need of physical printing, physical delivery and storage of books.
This therefore poses an interesting question that challenges publishers,
distributors and retailers. The question pertains to the role and importance
the publishing houses have in the overall publishing process. It is a common
practice that the author, the original creator of the work, signs the contract
awarding him or her only around 10% of the proceeds of the book._[_7_] Such
contract leaves 90% of the book proceeds to the publishing houses and
distribution companies. However, within the electronic book path the publishing
house role is reduced to the proofreading. This raises the question of how
reasonable is the practice that leaves them much higher percentage of proceeds
than to the authors.
In 2005, _A_m_a_z_o_n_._c_o_m announced its purchase of Booksurge and selfsanepublishing,
a major _p_r_i_n_t_ _o_n_ _d_e_m_a_n_d operation. This is probably intended as a preliminary
move towards establishing an Amazon _i_m_p_r_i_n_t.[_o_r_i_g_i_n_a_l_ _r_e_s_e_a_r_c_h_?] One of the
largest bookseller chains, Barnes & Noble, already runs its own successful
imprint with both new titles and classics â€” hardback editions of out-of-print
former best sellers. Similarly, Ingram Industries, parent company of Ingram
Book Group (a leading US book wholesaler), now includes its own print-on-demand
division called Lightning Source. Among publishers, _S_i_m_o_n_ _&_ _S_c_h_u_s_t_e_r recently
announced that it will start selling its backlist titles directly to consumers
through its website.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]
Book clubs are almost entirely direct-to-retail, and niche publishers pursue a
mixed strategy to sell through all available outlets â€” their output is
insignificant to the major booksellers, so lost revenue poses no threat to the
traditional symbiotic relationships between the four activities of printing,
publishing, distribution and retail.

thousands of authors have created their own publishing companies, and self-
published their own works.

Academic publishers are typically either book or periodical publishers that
have specialized in academic subjects. Some, like _u_n_i_v_e_r_s_i_t_y_ _p_r_e_s_s_e_s, are owned
by scholarly institutions. Others are commercial businesses that focus on
academic subjects.
The development of the _p_r_i_n_t_i_n_g_ _p_r_e_s_s represented a revolution for
communicating the latest hypotheses and research results to the academic
community and supplemented what a scholar could do personally. But this
improvement in the efficiency of communication created a challenge for
libraries, which have had to accommodate the weight and volume of literature.
One of the key functions that academic publishers provide is to manage the
process of _p_e_e_r_ _r_e_v_i_e_w. Their role is to facilitate the impartial assessment of
research and this vital role is not one that has yet been usurped, even with
the advent of social networking and online document sharing.
Today, publishing academic journals and textbooks is a large part of an
international industry. Critics claim that standardised accounting and profit-
oriented policies have displaced the publishing ideal of providing access to
all. In contrast to the commercial model, there is _n_o_n_-_p_r_o_f_i_t publishing, where
the publishing organization is either organised specifically for the purpose of
publishing, such as a _u_n_i_v_e_r_s_i_t_y_ _p_r_e_s_s, or is one of the functions of an
organisation such as a medical charity, founded to achieve specific practical
goals. An alternative approach to the corporate model is _o_p_e_n_ _a_c_c_e_s_s, the
online distribution of individual articles and academic journals without charge
to readers and libraries. The pioneers of Open Access journals are _B_i_o_M_e_d
_C_e_n_t_r_a_l and the Public Library of Science (_P_L_o_S). Many commercial publishers
are experimenting with hybrid models where older articles or government funded
articles are made free, and newer articles are available as part of a
subscription or individual article purchase.

Technically, radio, television, cinemas, VCDs and DVDs, music systems, games,
computer hardware and mobile telephony publish information to their audiences.
Indeed, the marketing of a major film often includes a _n_o_v_e_l_i_z_a_t_i_o_n, a graphic
novel or comic version, the soundtrack album, a game, model, toys and endless
promotional publications.
Some of the major publishers have entire divisions devoted to a single
franchise, e.g. Ballantine Del Rey Lucasbooks has the exclusive rights to Star
Wars in the United States; Random House UK (Bertelsmann)/Century LucasBooks
holds the same rights in the United Kingdom. The game industry self-publishes
through BL Publishing/_B_l_a_c_k_ _L_i_b_r_a_r_y (_W_a_r_h_a_m_m_e_r) and Wizards of the Coast

that does very well with long-running series such as _D_o_c_t_o_r_ _W_h_o. These
multimedia works are cross-marketed aggressively and sales frequently
outperform the average stand-alone published work, making them a focus of
corporate interest._[_9_]

Writers in a specialized field or with a narrower appeal have found smaller
alternatives to the mass market in the form of _s_m_a_l_l_ _p_r_e_s_s_e_s and _s_e_l_f_-

that mainstream publishing will not meet their needs or who are in a position
to make more money from direct sales than they could from _b_o_o_k_s_t_o_r_e sales, such
as popular speakers who sell books after speeches. Authors are more readily
published by this means due to the much lower costs involved.

The 21st century has brought a number of new technological changes to the
publishing industry. These changes include _e_-_b_o_o_k_s, _p_r_i_n_t_ _o_n_ _d_e_m_a_n_d and

major publishing markets such as the USA and the UK since 2005. _G_o_o_g_l_e,
_A_m_a_z_o_n_._c_o_m and _S_o_n_y have been leaders in working with publishers and libraries
to digitize books. As of early 2011 Amazon's _K_i_n_d_l_e reading device is a
significant force in the market, along with the _A_p_p_l_e _i_P_a_d and the _N_o_o_k from
_B_a_r_n_e_s_ _&_ _N_o_b_l_e.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]
The ability to quickly and cost-effectively _P_r_i_n_t_ _o_n_ _D_e_m_a_n_d has meant that
publishers no longer have to store books at warehouses, if the book is in low
or unknown demand. This is a huge advantage to small publishers who can now
operate without large overheads and large publishers who can now cost-
effectively sell their backlisted items.
_A_c_c_e_s_s_i_b_l_e_ _p_u_b_l_i_s_h_i_n_g uses the digitization of books to mark up books into _X_M_L

targeting those with difficulty reading. Formats include a variety larger print

Green publishing means adapting the publishing process to minimise
environmental impact. One example of this is the concept of on-demand printing,
using digital or print-on-demand technology. This cuts down the need to ship
books since they are manufactured close to the customer on a just-in-time
basis._[_1_2_]
A further development is the growth of on-line publishing where no physical
books are produced. The ebook is created by the author and uploaded to a
website from where it can be downloaded and read by anyone.
An increasing number of small authors are using _n_i_c_h_e_ _m_a_r_k_e_t_i_n_g online to sell

In providing a work to the general public, the publisher takes responsibility
for the publication in a way that a mere printer or a shopkeeper does not. For
example, publishers may face charges of _d_e_f_a_m_a_t_i_o_n, if they produce and
distribute libelous material to the public, even if the libel was written by
another person.

_P_r_i_v_i_s_h_i_n_g (pprriivvate publiisshhiinngg) is a recently coined term for publishing a book
in such a small amount, or with such lack of marketing, advertising or sales
support from the publisher, that the book effectively does not reach the
public._[_1_8_] The book, while nominally published, is almost impossible to obtain
through normal channels such as bookshops, often cannot be special-ordered and
will have a notable lack of support from its publisher, including refusals to
reprint the title. A book that is privished may be referred to as "killed".
Depending on the motivation, privishing may constitute _b_r_e_a_c_h_ _o_f_ _c_o_n_t_r_a_c_t,
