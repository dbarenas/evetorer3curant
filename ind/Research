SScciieennttiiffiicc rreesseeaarrcchh relies on the application of the scientific method, a
harnessing of _c_u_r_i_o_s_i_t_y. This research provides _s_c_i_e_n_t_i_f_i_c information and
theories for the explanation of the _n_a_t_u_r_e and the properties of the world. It
makes practical applications possible. Scientific research is funded by public
authorities, by charitable organizations and by private groups, including many
companies. Scientific research can be subdivided into different classifications
according to their academic and application disciplines. Scientific research is
a widely used criterion for judging the standing of an academic institution,
such as business schools, but some argue that such is an inaccurate assessment
of the institution, because the quality of research does not tell about the
quality of teaching (these do not necessarily correlate totally)._[_2_]
RReesseeaarrcchh iinn tthhee hhuummaanniittiieess involves different methods such as for example
_h_e_r_m_e_n_e_u_t_i_c_s and _s_e_m_i_o_t_i_c_s, and a different, more _r_e_l_a_t_i_v_i_s_t _e_p_i_s_t_e_m_o_l_o_g_y.
Humanities scholars usually do not search for the ultimate correct answer to a
question, but instead explore the issues and details that surround it. Context
is always important, and context can be social, historical, political, cultural
or ethnic. An example of research in the humanities is historical research,
which is embodied in _h_i_s_t_o_r_i_c_a_l_ _m_e_t_h_o_d. Historians use _p_r_i_m_a_r_y_ _s_o_u_r_c_e_s and
other _e_v_i_d_e_n_c_e to systematically investigate a topic, and then to write
histories in the form of accounts of the past.
AArrttiissttiicc rreesseeaarrcchh, also seen as 'practice-based research', can take form when
creative works are considered both the research and the object of research
itself. It is the debatable body of thought which offers an alternative to
purely scientific methods in research in its search for knowledge and truth.

Research has been defined in a number of different ways.
A broad definition of research is given by Martyn Shuttleworth - "In the
broadest sense of the word, the definition of research includes any gathering
of data, information and facts for the advancement of knowledge."_[_5_]
Another definition of research is given by Creswell who states - "Research is a
process of steps used to collect and analyze information to increase our
understanding of a topic or issue". It consists of three steps: Pose a
question, collect data to answer the question, and present an answer to the
question._[_6_]
The Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary defines research in more detail as "a
studious inquiry or examination; especially  : investigation or experimentation
aimed at the discovery and interpretation of facts, revision of accepted
theories or laws in the light of new facts, or practical application of such
new or revised theories or laws"._[_4_]

Research is often conducted using the hourglass model structure of research._[_7_]
The hourglass model starts with a broad spectrum for research, focusing in on
the required information through the method of the project (like the neck of
the hourglass), then expands the research in the form of discussion and
results. The major steps in conducting research are:_[_8_]
    * Identification of research problem
    * Literature review
    * Specifying the purpose of research
    * Determine specific research questions or hypotheses
    * Data collection
    * Analyzing and interpreting the data
    * Reporting and evaluating research
The steps generally represent the overall process, however they should be
viewed as an ever-changing process rather than a fixed set of steps._[_9_] Most
researches begin with a general statement of the problem, or rather, the
purpose for engaging in the study._[_1_0_] The literature review identifies flaws
or holes in previous research which provides justification for the study.
Often, a literature review is conducted in a given subject area before a
research question is identified. A gap in the current literature, as identified
by a researcher, then engenders a research question. The research question may
be parallel to the hypothesis. The hypothesis is the supposition to be tested.
The researcher(s) collects data to test the hypothesis. The researcher(s) then
analyzes and interprets the data via a variety of statistical methods, engaging
in what is known as _E_m_p_i_r_i_c_a_l_ _r_e_s_e_a_r_c_h. The results of the data analysis in
confirming or failing to reject the _N_u_l_l_ _h_y_p_o_t_h_e_s_i_s are then reported and
evaluated. At the end the researcher may discuss avenues for further research.
_R_u_d_o_l_p_h_ _R_u_m_m_e_l says, "... no researcher should accept any one or two tests as
definitive. It is only when a range of tests are consistent over many kinds of
data, researchers, and methods can one have confidence in the results."_[_1_1_]

Generally, research is understood to follow a certain structural _p_r_o_c_e_s_s.
Though step order may vary depending on the subject matter and researcher, the
following steps are usually part of most formal research, both basic and
applied:
   1. _O_b_s_e_r_v_a_t_i_o_n_s_ _a_n_d_ _F_o_r_m_a_t_i_o_n_ _o_f_ _t_h_e_ _t_o_p_i_c: Consists of the subject area of
      ones interest and following that subject area to conduct subject related
      research. The subject area should not be randomly chosen since it
      requires reading a vast amount of literature on the topic to determine
      the gap in the literature the researcher intends to narrow. A keen
      interest in the chosen subject area is advisable. The research will have
      to be justified by linking its importance to already existing knowledge
      about the topic.
   2. _H_y_p_o_t_h_e_s_i_s: A testable prediction which designates the relationship
      between two or more variables.
   3. _C_o_n_c_e_p_t_u_a_l_ _d_e_f_i_n_i_t_i_o_n: Description of a concept by relating it to other

      how they will be measured/assessed in the study.
   5. _G_a_t_h_e_r_i_n_g_ _o_f_ _d_a_t_a: Consists of identifying a population and selecting
      samples, gathering information from and/or about these samples by using
      specific research instruments. The instruments used for data collection
      must be valid and reliable.
   6. _A_n_a_l_y_s_i_s_ _o_f_ _d_a_t_a: Involves breaking down the individual pieces of data in
      order to draw conclusions about it.

A common misconception is that a hypothesis will be proven (see, rather, _N_u_l_l
_h_y_p_o_t_h_e_s_i_s). Generally a hypothesis is used to make predictions that can be
tested by observing the outcome of an experiment. If the outcome is
inconsistent with the hypothesis, then the hypothesis is rejected (see
_f_a_l_s_i_f_i_a_b_i_l_i_t_y). However, if the outcome is consistent with the hypothesis, the
experiment is said to support the hypothesis. This careful language is used
because researchers recognize that alternative hypotheses may also be
consistent with the observations. In this sense, a hypothesis can never be
proven, but rather only supported by surviving rounds of scientific testing
and, eventually, becoming widely thought of as true.
A useful hypothesis allows prediction and within the accuracy of observation of
the time, the prediction will be verified. As the accuracy of observation
improves with time, the hypothesis may no longer provide an accurate
prediction. In this case a new hypothesis will arise to challenge the old, and
to the extent that the new hypothesis makes more accurate predictions than the
old, the new will supplant it. Researchers can also use a null hypothesis,
which state no relationship or difference between the independent or dependent
variables. A null hypothesis uses a sample of all possible people to make a
conclusion about the population._[_1_2_]

      Systematic empirical investigation of quantitative properties and
      phenomena and their relationships. Asking a narrow question and
      collecting numerical data to analyze utilizing _s_t_a_t_i_s_t_i_c_a_l methods. The
      quantitative research designs are experimental, correlational, and survey
      (or descriptive)._[_1_5_] Statistics derived from quantitative research can
      be used to establish the existence of associative or causal relationships
      between variables. Quantitative research is linked with the philosophical
      and theoretical stance of _p_o_s_i_t_i_v_i_s_m.
The Quantitative data collection methods rely on random sampling and structured
data collection instruments that fit diverse experiences into predetermined
response categories[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]. These methods produce results that are
easy to summarize, compare, and generalize[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]. Quantitative
research is concerned with testing hypotheses derived from theory and/or being
able to estimate the size of a phenomenon of interest. Depending on the
research question, participants may be randomly assigned to different
treatments (this is the only way that a quantitative study can be considered a
true experiment)[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]. If this is not feasible, the researcher may
collect data on participant and situational characteristics in order to
statistically control for their influence on the dependent, or outcome,
variable. If the intent is to generalize from the research participants to a
larger population, the researcher will employ probability sampling to select
participants._[_1_6_]
In either qualitative or quantitative research, the researcher(s) may collect
primary or secondary data. Primary data is data collected specifically for the
research, such as through interviews or questionnaires. Secondary data is data
that already exists, such as _c_e_n_s_u_s data, which can be re-used for the
research. It is good ethical research practice to use secondary data wherever
possible._[_1_7_]
Mixed-method research, i.e. research that includes qualitative and quantitative
elements, using both primary and secondary data, is becoming more common._[_1_8_]

Cover of the first issue of _N_a_t_u_r_e, 4 November 1869.
_A_c_a_d_e_m_i_c_ _p_u_b_l_i_s_h_i_n_g describes a system that is necessary in order for academic
_s_c_h_o_l_a_r_s to _p_e_e_r_ _r_e_v_i_e_w the work and make it available for a wider audience.
The system varies widely by field, and is also always changing, if often
slowly. Most academic work is published in journal article or book form. There
is also a large body of research that exists in either a thesis or dissertation
form. These forms of research can be found in databases explicitly for theses
and dissertations. In publishing, STM publishing is an abbreviation for
academic publications in science, technology, and _m_e_d_i_c_i_n_e.
Most established _a_c_a_d_e_m_i_c_ _f_i_e_l_d_s have their own journals and other outlets for
publication, though many _a_c_a_d_e_m_i_c_ _j_o_u_r_n_a_l_s are somewhat interdisciplinary, and
publish work from several distinct fields or subfields. The kinds of
publications that are accepted as contributions of knowledge or research vary
greatly between fields; from the print to the electronic format. A study
suggests that researchers should not give great consideration to findings that
are not replicated frequently._[_1_9_] It has also been suggested that all
published studies should be subjected to some measure for assessing the
validity or reliability of its factors in order to prevent the publication of
unproven findings._[_2_0_] _B_u_s_i_n_e_s_s_ _m_o_d_e_l_s are different in the electronic
environment. Since about the early 1990s, licensing of electronic resources,
particularly journals, has been very common. Presently, a major trend,
particularly with respect to scholarly journals, is _o_p_e_n_ _a_c_c_e_s_s._[_2_1_] There are
two main forms of open access: open access publishing, in which the articles or
the whole journal is freely available from the time of publication, and _s_e_l_f_-
_a_r_c_h_i_v_i_n_g, where the author makes a copy of their own work freely available on
the web.

Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; and government research councils such as the

in the UK. These are managed primarily through universities and in some cases
through military contractors. Many senior researchers (such as group leaders)
spend a significant amount of their time applying for grants for research
funds. These grants are necessary not only for researchers to carry out their
research, but also as a source of merit.
The Social Psychology Network provides a comprehensive list of U.S. Government
and private foundation funding sources.

Original research can take a number of forms, depending on the discipline it
pertains to. In _e_x_p_e_r_i_m_e_n_t_a_l work, it typically involves direct or indirect
observation of the researched subject, e.g., in the laboratory or in the field,
documents the methodology, results, and conclusions of an experiment or set of
experiments, or offers a novel interpretation of previous results. In
_a_n_a_l_y_t_i_c_a_l work, there are typically some new (for example) mathematical
results produced, or a new way of approaching an existing problem. In some
subjects which do not typically carry out experimentation or analysis of this
kind, the originality is in the particular way existing understanding is
changed or re-interpreted based on the outcome of the work of the _r_e_s_e_a_r_c_h_e_r.
_[_2_5_]
The degree of originality of the research is among major criteria for articles
to be published in _a_c_a_d_e_m_i_c_ _j_o_u_r_n_a_l_s and usually established by means of _p_e_e_r

The controversial trend of artistic teaching becoming more academics-oriented
is leading to artistic research being accepted as the primary mode of enquiry
in art as in the case of other disciplines._[_2_8_] One of the characteristics of
_a_r_t_i_s_t_i_c research is that it must accept _s_u_b_j_e_c_t_i_v_i_t_y as opposed to the
classical scientific methods. As such, it is similar to the _s_o_c_i_a_l_ _s_c_i_e_n_c_e_s in
using _q_u_a_l_i_t_a_t_i_v_e_ _r_e_s_e_a_r_c_h and _i_n_t_e_r_s_u_b_j_e_c_t_i_v_i_t_y as tools to apply measurement
and critical analysis._[_2_9_]
Artistic research has been defined by the _U_n_i_v_e_r_s_i_t_y_ _o_f_ _D_a_n_c_e_ _a_n_d_ _C_i_r_c_u_s (Dans
och Cirkush√∂gskolan, DOCH), _S_t_o_c_k_h_o_l_m in the following manner - "Artistic
research is to investigate and test with the purpose of gaining knowledge
within and for our artistic disciplines. It is based on artistic practices,
methods and criticality. Through presented documentation, the insights gained
shall be placed in a context."_[_3_0_] Artistic research aims to enhance knowledge
and understanding with presentation of the arts._[_3_1_] For a survey of the
central problematics of today's Artistic Research see Giaco Schiesser._[_3_2_]
Most writers, whether of fiction or non-fiction, also have to do research to
support their creative work. This may be factual, historical, or background
research. Background research could include, for example, geographical or
procedural research._[_3_3_]
