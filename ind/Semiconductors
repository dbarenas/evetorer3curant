A sseemmiiccoonndduuccttoorr is a material which has _e_l_e_c_t_r_i_c_a_l_ _c_o_n_d_u_c_t_i_v_i_t_y to a degree
between that of a _m_e_t_a_l (such as copper) and that of an _i_n_s_u_l_a_t_o_r (such as
glass). Semiconductors are the foundation of modern _s_o_l_i_d_ _s_t_a_t_e _e_l_e_c_t_r_o_n_i_c_s,
including _t_r_a_n_s_i_s_t_o_r_s, _s_o_l_a_r_ _c_e_l_l_s, _l_i_g_h_t_-_e_m_i_t_t_i_n_g_ _d_i_o_d_e_s (LEDs), _q_u_a_n_t_u_m_ _d_o_t_s
and digital and analog _i_n_t_e_g_r_a_t_e_d_ _c_i_r_c_u_i_t_s.
A semiconductor may have a number of unique properties, one of which is the
ability to change conductivity by the addition of impurities ("_d_o_p_i_n_g") or by
interaction with another phenomenon, such as an _e_l_e_c_t_r_i_c_ _f_i_e_l_d or _l_i_g_h_t; this
ability makes a semiconductor very useful for constructing a device that can
amplify, switch, or convert an energy input. The modern understanding of the
properties of a semiconductor relies on _q_u_a_n_t_u_m_ _p_h_y_s_i_c_s to explain the movement
of _e_l_e_c_t_r_o_n_s inside a _l_a_t_t_i_c_e of atoms.

  Variable conductivity
      A pure semiconductor is a poor electrical conductor as a consequence of
      having just the right number of electrons to completely fill its _v_a_l_e_n_c_e
      _b_o_n_d_s. Through various techniques (e.g., _d_o_p_i_n_g or _g_a_t_i_n_g), the
      semiconductor can be modified to have excess of electrons (becoming an nn--
      ttyyppee sseemmiiccoonndduuccttoorr) or a deficiency of electrons (becoming a pp--ttyyppee
      sseemmiiccoonndduuccttoorr). In both cases, the semiconductor becomes much more
      conductive (the conductivity can be increased by one million fold or
      more). Semiconductor devices exploit this effect to shape electrical
      current.
  Junctions
      When doped semiconductors are joined _t_o_ _m_e_t_a_l_s, _t_o_ _d_i_f_f_e_r_e_n_t
      _s_e_m_i_c_o_n_d_u_c_t_o_r_s, and _t_o_ _t_h_e_ _s_a_m_e_ _s_e_m_i_c_o_n_d_u_c_t_o_r_ _w_i_t_h_ _d_i_f_f_e_r_e_n_t_ _d_o_p_i_n_g, the
      resulting junction often strips the electron excess or deficiency out
      from the semiconductor near the junction. This _d_e_p_l_e_t_i_o_n_ _r_e_g_i_o_n is
      _r_e_c_t_i_f_y_i_n_g (only allowing current to flow in one direction), and used to
      further shape electrical currents in semiconductor devices.
  Energetic electrons travel far
      Electrons can be excited across the energy _b_a_n_d_ _g_a_p (see Physics below)
      of a semiconductor by various means. These electrons can carry their
      excess energy over distance scales of microns before dissipating their
      energy into heat, significantly longer than is possible in metals. This
      effect is essential to the operation of _b_i_p_o_l_a_r_ _j_u_n_c_t_i_o_n_ _t_r_a_n_s_i_s_t_o_r_s.
  Light energy conversion
      Electrons in a semiconductor can absorb light, and subsequently retain
      the energy from the light for a long enough time to be useful for
      producing electrical work instead of heat. This principle is used in the
      _p_h_o_t_o_v_o_l_t_a_i_c_ _c_e_l_l.
      Conversely, in certain semiconductors, electrically excited electrons can
      relax by emitting light instead of producing heat. This is used in the
      _l_i_g_h_t_ _e_m_i_t_t_i_n_g_ _d_i_o_d_e and _q_u_a_n_t_u_m_ _d_o_t_s.
  Thermal energy conversion
      Semiconductors are good materials for _t_h_e_r_m_o_e_l_e_c_t_r_i_c_ _c_o_o_l_e_r_s and
      _t_h_e_r_m_o_e_l_e_c_t_r_i_c_ _g_e_n_e_r_a_t_o_r_s, which convert temperature differences into
      electrical power and vice versa. _P_e_l_t_i_e_r_ _c_o_o_l_e_r_s use semiconductors for
      this reason.

      different group IV elements, e.g. _s_i_l_i_c_o_n_ _c_a_r_b_i_d_e.
    * Certain ternary compounds, oxides and alloys.

Most common semiconducting materials are crystalline solids, but amorphous and
liquid semiconductors are also known. These include _h_y_d_r_o_g_e_n_a_t_e_d_ _a_m_o_r_p_h_o_u_s

proportions. These compounds share with better known semiconductors the
properties of intermediate conductivity and a rapid variation of conductivity
with temperature, as well as occasional _n_e_g_a_t_i_v_e_ _r_e_s_i_s_t_a_n_c_e. Such disordered
materials lack the rigid crystalline structure of conventional semiconductors
such as silicon. They are generally used in _t_h_i_n_ _f_i_l_m structures, which do not
require material of higher electronic quality, being relatively insensitive to
impurities and radiation damage.

Semiconductors with predictable, reliable electronic properties are necessary
for _m_a_s_s_ _p_r_o_d_u_c_t_i_o_n. The level of chemical purity needed is extremely high
because the presence of impurities even in very small proportions can have
large effects on the properties of the material. A high degree of crystalline
perfection is also required, since faults in crystal structure (such as
_d_i_s_l_o_c_a_t_i_o_n_s, _t_w_i_n_s, and _s_t_a_c_k_i_n_g_ _f_a_u_l_t_s) interfere with the semiconducting
properties of the material. Crystalline faults are a major cause of defective
semiconductor devices. The larger the crystal, the more difficult it is to
achieve the necessary perfection. Current mass production processes use crystal
_i_n_g_o_t_s between 100 mm and 300 mm (4‚Äì12 inches) in diameter which are grown as
cylinders and sliced into _w_a_f_e_r_s.
Because of the required level of chemical purity and the perfection of the
crystal structure which are needed to make semiconductor devices, special
methods have been developed to produce the initial semiconductor material. A
technique for achieving high purity includes growing the crystal using the
_C_z_o_c_h_r_a_l_s_k_i_ _p_r_o_c_e_s_s. An additional step that can be used to further increase
purity is known as _z_o_n_e_ _r_e_f_i_n_i_n_g. In zone refining, part of a solid crystal is
melted. The impurities tend to concentrate in the melted region, while the
desired material recrystalizes leaving the solid material more pure and with
fewer crystalline faults.
In manufacturing semiconductor devices involving _h_e_t_e_r_o_j_u_n_c_t_i_o_n_s between
different semiconductor materials, it is often important to align the crystal
lattices of the two materials by using _e_p_i_t_a_x_i_a_l_ _t_e_c_h_n_i_q_u_e_s. The _l_a_t_t_i_c_e
_c_o_n_s_t_a_n_t, which is the length of the repeating element of the crystal
structure, is important for determining the compatibility of materials.

Semiconductors are defined by their unique electric conductive behavior,
somewhere between that of a metal and an insulator. The differences between
these materials can be understood in terms of the _q_u_a_n_t_u_m_ _s_t_a_t_e_s for electrons,
each of which may contain zero or one electron (by the _P_a_u_l_i_ _e_x_c_l_u_s_i_o_n
_p_r_i_n_c_i_p_l_e). These states are associated with the _e_l_e_c_t_r_o_n_i_c_ _b_a_n_d_ _s_t_r_u_c_t_u_r_e of

in states that are _d_e_l_o_c_a_l_i_z_e_d (extending through the material), however in
order to transport electrons a state must be partially filled, containing an
electron only part of the time._[_2_] If the state is always occupied with an
electron, then it is inert, blocking the passage of other electrons via that
state. The energies of these quantum states are critical, since a state is
partially filled only if its energy is near to the _F_e_r_m_i_ _l_e_v_e_l (see _F_e_r_m_i_-_D_i_r_a_c
_s_t_a_t_i_s_t_i_c_s).
A high conductivity comes from the combination of many partially filled states
and a high amount of delocalization in those states. Metals are good _e_l_e_c_t_r_i_c_a_l
_c_o_n_d_u_c_t_o_r_s due to precisely this combination, having in particular many
partially filled states due to their large density of states near the Fermi
level. _I_n_s_u_l_a_t_o_r_s, by contrast, have very few partially filled states, because
the Fermi level is surrounded by a large _g_a_p in the band structure, devoid of
states. Importantly, an insulator can be made to conduct by increasing its
temperature: heating provides energy to promote some electrons across the band
gap, inducing partially filled states in both the band of states beneath the
band gap (_v_a_l_e_n_c_e_ _b_a_n_d) and the band of states above the band gap (_c_o_n_d_u_c_t_i_o_n
_b_a_n_d). A pure semiconductor (intrinsic semiconductor) is essentially the same
as an insulator except with a smaller gap, so that room temperature is already
hot enough (relative to _a_b_s_o_l_u_t_e_ _z_e_r_o) to excite many electrons across the band
gap._[_3_]
A pure semiconductor, however, is not very useful, as it is neither a very good
insulator nor a very good conductor. However, one important feature of
semiconductors (and some insulators, known as semi-insulators) is that their
conductivity can be increased and controlled by _d_o_p_i_n_g with impurities and
_g_a_t_i_n_g with electric fields. Doping and gating move either the conduction or
valence band much closer to the Fermi level, and greatly increase the number of
partially filled states.
Some wider-_b_a_n_d_ _g_a_p semiconductor materials are sometimes referred to as sseemmii--
iinnssuullaattoorrss. When undoped, these have electrical conductivity nearer to that of
electrical insulators, however they can be doped (making them as useful as
semiconductors). Semi-insulators find niche applications in micro-electronics,
such as substrates for _H_E_M_T. An example of a common semi-insulator is _g_a_l_l_i_u_m
_a_r_s_e_n_i_d_e._[_4_] Some materials, such as _t_i_t_a_n_i_u_m_ _d_i_o_x_i_d_e, can even be used as
insulating materials for some applications, while being treated as wide-gap
semiconductors for other applications.

The partial filling of the states at the bottom of the conduction band can be
understood as adding electrons to that band. The electrons do not stay
indefinitely (due to the natural thermal _r_e_c_o_m_b_i_n_a_t_i_o_n) but they can move
around for some time. The actual concentration of electrons is typically very
dilute, and so (unlike in metals) it is possible to think of the electrons in
the conduction band of a semiconductor as a sort of classical _i_d_e_a_l_ _g_a_s, where
the electrons fly around freely without being subject to the _P_a_u_l_i_ _e_x_c_l_u_s_i_o_n
_p_r_i_n_c_i_p_l_e. In most semiconductors the conduction bands have a parabolic
_d_i_s_p_e_r_s_i_o_n_ _r_e_l_a_t_i_o_n, and so these electrons respond to forces (electric field,
magnetic field, etc.) much like they would in a vacuum, though with a different
_e_f_f_e_c_t_i_v_e_ _m_a_s_s._[_3_] Because the electrons behave like an ideal gas, one may also
think about conduction in very simplistic terms such as the _D_r_u_d_e_ _m_o_d_e_l, and
introduce concepts such as _e_l_e_c_t_r_o_n_ _m_o_b_i_l_i_t_y.
For partial filling at the top of the valence band, it is helpful to introduce
the concept of an _e_l_e_c_t_r_o_n_ _h_o_l_e. Although the electrons in the valence band are
always moving around, a completely full valence band is inert, not conducting
any current. If an electron is taken out of the valence band, then the
trajectory that the electron would normally have taken is now missing its
charge. For the purposes of electric current, this combination of the full
valence band, minus the electron, can be converted into a picture of a
completely empty band containing a positively charged particle that moves in
the same way as the electron. Combined with the negative effective mass of the
electrons at the top of the valence band, we arrive at a picture of a
positively charged particle that responds to electric and magnetic fields just
as a normal positively charged particle would do in vacuum, again with some
positive effective mass._[_3_] This particle is called a hole, and the collection
of holes in the valence can again be understood in simple classical terms (as
with the electrons in the conduction band).

When _i_o_n_i_z_i_n_g_ _r_a_d_i_a_t_i_o_n strikes a semiconductor, it may excite an electron out
of its energy level and consequently leave a hole. This process is known as
_e_l_e_c_t_r_o_n_‚_Ä_ì_h_o_l_e_ _p_a_i_r_ _g_e_n_e_r_a_t_i_o_n. Electron-hole pairs are constantly generated
from _t_h_e_r_m_a_l_ _e_n_e_r_g_y as well, in the absence of any external energy source.
Electron-hole pairs are also apt to recombine. _C_o_n_s_e_r_v_a_t_i_o_n_ _o_f_ _e_n_e_r_g_y demands
that these recombination events, in which an electron loses an amount of _e_n_e_r_g_y
larger than the _b_a_n_d_ _g_a_p, be accompanied by the emission of thermal energy (in
the form of _p_h_o_n_o_n_s) or radiation (in the form of _p_h_o_t_o_n_s).
In some states, the generation and recombination of electron‚Äìhole pairs are
in equipoise. The number of electron-hole pairs in the _s_t_e_a_d_y_ _s_t_a_t_e at a given
temperature is determined by _q_u_a_n_t_u_m_ _s_t_a_t_i_s_t_i_c_a_l_ _m_e_c_h_a_n_i_c_s. The precise _q_u_a_n_t_u_m
_m_e_c_h_a_n_i_c_a_l mechanisms of generation and recombination are governed by
_c_o_n_s_e_r_v_a_t_i_o_n_ _o_f_ _e_n_e_r_g_y and _c_o_n_s_e_r_v_a_t_i_o_n_ _o_f_ _m_o_m_e_n_t_u_m.
As the probability that electrons and holes meet together is proportional to
the product of their amounts, the product is in steady state nearly constant at
a given temperature, providing that there is no significant electric field
(which might "flush" carriers of both types, or move them from neighbour
regions containing more of them to meet together) or externally driven pair
generation. The product is a function of the temperature, as the probability of
getting enough thermal energy to produce a pair increases with temperature,
being approximately exp(‚àíEG/kT), where k is _B_o_l_t_z_m_a_n_n_'_s_ _c_o_n_s_t_a_n_t, T is
absolute temperature and EG is band gap.
The probability of meeting is increased by carrier traps‚Äîimpurities or
dislocations which can trap an electron or hole and hold it until a pair is
completed. Such carrier traps are sometimes purposely added to reduce the time
needed to reach the steady state.

The conductivity of semiconductors may easily be modified by introducing
impurities into their _c_r_y_s_t_a_l_ _l_a_t_t_i_c_e. The process of adding controlled
impurities to a semiconductor is known as doping. The amount of impurity, or
dopant, added to an _i_n_t_r_i_n_s_i_c (pure) semiconductor varies its level of
conductivity. Doped semiconductors are referred to as _e_x_t_r_i_n_s_i_c. By adding
impurity to pure semiconductors, the electrical conductivity may be varied by
factors of thousands or millions.
A 1 cm3 specimen of a metal or semiconductor has of the order of 1022 atoms. In
a metal, every atom donates at least one free electron for conduction, thus
1 cm3 of metal contains on the order of 1022 free electrons, whereas a 1 cm3
sample of pure germanium at 20 ¬∞C contains about 4.2√ó1022 atoms, but only
2.5√ó1013 free electrons and 2.5√ó1013 holes. The addition of 0.001% of arsenic
(an impurity) donates an extra 1017 free electrons in the same volume and the
electrical conductivity is increased by a factor of 10,000.
The materials chosen as suitable dopants depend on the atomic properties of
both the dopant and the material to be doped. In general, dopants that produce
the desired controlled changes are classified as either electron _a_c_c_e_p_t_o_r_s or
_d_o_n_o_r_s. Semiconductors doped with donor impurities are called n-type, while
those doped with acceptor impurities are known as p-type. The n and p type
designations indicate which charge carrier acts as the material's _m_a_j_o_r_i_t_y
_c_a_r_r_i_e_r. The opposite carrier is called the _m_i_n_o_r_i_t_y_ _c_a_r_r_i_e_r, which exists due
to thermal excitation at a much lower concentration compared to the majority
carrier.
For example, the pure semiconductor _s_i_l_i_c_o_n has four valence electrons which
bond each silicon atom to its neighbors. In silicon, the most common dopants
are group III and group V elements. Group III elements all contain three
valence electrons, causing them to function as acceptors when used to dope
silicon. When an acceptor atom replaces a silicon atom in the crystal, a vacant
state ( an electron "hole") is created, which can move around the lattice and
functions as a charge carrier. Group V elements have five valence electrons,
which allows them to act as a donor; substitution of these atoms for silicon
creates an extra free electron. Therefore, a silicon crystal doped with _b_o_r_o_n
creates a p-type semiconductor whereas one doped with _p_h_o_s_p_h_o_r_u_s results in an
n-type material.
During _m_a_n_u_f_a_c_t_u_r_e, dopants can be diffused into the semiconductor body by
contact with gaseous compounds of the desired element, or _i_o_n_ _i_m_p_l_a_n_t_a_t_i_o_n can
be used to accurately position the doped regions.

The history of the understanding of semiconductors begins with experiments on
the electrical properties of materials. The properties of negative temperature
coefficient of resistance, rectification, and light-sensitivity were observed
starting in the early 19th century.
In 1833, _M_i_c_h_a_e_l_ _F_a_r_a_d_a_y reported that the resistance of specimens of _s_i_l_v_e_r
_s_u_l_f_i_d_e decreases when they are heated. This is contrary to the behavior of
metallic substances such as copper. In 1839, _A_._ _E_._ _B_e_c_q_u_e_r_e_l reported
observation of a voltage between a solid and a liquid electrolyte when struck
by light, the _p_h_o_t_o_v_o_l_t_a_i_c_ _e_f_f_e_c_t. In 1873 _W_i_l_l_o_u_g_h_b_y_ _S_m_i_t_h observed that
_s_e_l_e_n_i_u_m _r_e_s_i_s_t_o_r_s exhibit decreasing resistance when light falls on them. In
1874 _K_a_r_l_ _F_e_r_d_i_n_a_n_d_ _B_r_a_u_n observed conduction and rectification in metallic
sulphides, and _A_r_t_h_u_r_ _S_c_h_u_s_t_e_r found that a copper oxide layer on wires has
rectification properties that ceases when the wires are cleaned. Adams and Day
observed the photovoltaic effect in selenium in 1876._[_5_]
A unified explanation of these phenomena required a theory of _s_o_l_i_d_ _s_t_a_t_e
_p_h_y_s_i_c_s which developed greatly in the first half of the 20th Century. In 1878
_E_d_w_i_n_ _H_e_r_b_e_r_t_ _H_a_l_l demonstrated the deflection of flowing charge carriers by an
applied magnetic field, the _H_a_l_l_ _e_f_f_e_c_t. The discovery of the _e_l_e_c_t_r_o_n by _J_._J_.
_T_h_o_m_s_o_n in 1897 prompted theories of electron-based conduction in solids. _K_a_r_l
_B_a_e_d_e_k_e_r, by observing a Hall effect with the reverse sign to that in metals,
theorized that copper iodide had positive charge carriers. _J_o_h_a_n_ _K_o_e_n_i_g_s_b_e_r_g_e_r
classified solid materials as metals, insulators and "variable conductors" in
1914. _F_e_l_i_x_ _B_l_o_c_h published a theory of the movement of electrons through
atomic lattices in 1928. In 1930, B. Gudden stated that conductivity in
semiconductors was due to minor concentrations of impurities. By 1931, the band
theory of conduction had been established by _A_l_a_n_ _H_e_r_r_i_e_s_ _W_i_l_s_o_n and the
concept of band gaps had been developed. _W_a_l_t_e_r_ _H_._ _S_c_h_o_t_t_k_y and _N_e_v_i_l_l_ _F_r_a_n_c_i_s
_M_o_t_t developed models of the potential barrier and of the characteristics of a
_m_e_t_a_l_-_s_e_m_i_c_o_n_d_u_c_t_o_r_ _j_u_n_c_t_i_o_n. By 1938, _B_o_r_i_s_ _D_a_v_y_d_o_v had developed a theory of
the copper-oxide rectifer, identifying the effect of the _p_‚_Ä_ì_n_ _j_u_n_c_t_i_o_n and the
importance of minority carriers and surface states._[_6_]
Agreement between theoretical predictions (based on developing quantum
mechanics) and experimental results was sometimes poor. This was later
explained by _J_o_h_n_ _B_a_r_d_e_e_n as due to the extreme "structure sensitive" behavior
of semiconductors, whose properties change dramatically based on tiny amounts
of impurities._[_6_] Commercially pure materials of the 1920s containing varying
proportions of trace contaminants produced differing experimental results. This
spurred the development of improved material refining techniques, culminating
in modern semiconductor refineries producing materials with parts-per-trillion
purity.
Devices using semiconductors were at first constructed based on empirical
knowledge, before semiconductor theory provided a guide to construction of more
capable and reliable devices.
_A_l_e_x_a_n_d_e_r_ _G_r_a_h_a_m_ _B_e_l_l used the light-sensitive property of selenium to
_P_h_o_t_o_p_h_o_n_e transmit sound over a beam of light in 1880. A working solar cell,
of low efficiency, was constructed by _C_h_a_r_l_e_s_ _F_r_i_t_t_s in 1883 using a metal
plate coated with selenium and a thin layer of gold; the device became
commercially useful in photographic light meters in the 1930s._[_6_] Point-contact
microwave detector rectifiers made of lead sulfide were used by _J_a_g_a_d_i_s_h
_C_h_a_n_d_r_a_ _B_o_s_e in 1904; the _c_a_t_'_s_-_w_h_i_s_k_e_r_ _d_e_t_e_c_t_o_r using natural galena or other
materials became a common device in the _d_e_v_e_l_o_p_m_e_n_t_ _o_f_ _r_a_d_i_o. However, it was
somewhat unpredictable in operation and required manual adjustment for best
performance. In 1906 _H_._J_._ _R_o_u_n_d observed light emission when electric current
passed through silicon carbide crystals, the principle behind the _l_i_g_h_t
_e_m_i_t_t_i_n_g_ _d_i_o_d_e. _O_l_e_g_ _L_o_s_e_v observed similar light emission in 1922 but at the
time the effect had no practical use. Power rectifiers, using copper oxide and
selenium, were developed in the 1920s and became commercially important as an
alternative to _v_a_c_u_u_m_ _t_u_b_e rectifiers._[_5_]_[_6_]
In the years preceding _W_o_r_l_d_ _W_a_r_ _I_I, infra-red detection and communications
devices prompted research into lead-sulfide and lead-selenide materials. These
devices were used for detecting ships and aircraft, for infrared rangefinders,
and for voice communication systems. The point-contact crystal detector became
vital for microwave radio systems, since available vacuum tube devices could
not serve as detectors above about 4000 MHz; advanced radar systems relied on
the fast response of crystal detectors. Considerable research and development
of silicon materials occurred during the war to develop detectors of consistent
quality._[_6_]
Detector and power rectifiers could not amplify a signal. Many efforts were
made to develop a solid-state amplifier, but these were unsuccessful because of
limited theoretical understanding of semiconductor materials._[_6_] In 1922 _O_l_e_g
_L_o_s_e_v developed two-terminal, _n_e_g_a_t_i_v_e_ _r_e_s_i_s_t_a_n_c_e amplifiers for radio;
however, he perished in the _S_i_e_g_e_ _o_f_ _L_e_n_i_n_g_r_a_d. In 1926 _J_u_l_i_u_s_ _E_d_g_a_r_d_ _L_i_l_e_n_f_e_l_d
patented a device resembling a modern field-effect transistor, but it was not
practical. R. Hilsch and R. W. Pohl in 1938 demonstrated a solid-state
amplifier using a structure resembling the control grid of a vacuum tube;
although the device displayed power gain, it had a _c_u_t_-_o_f_f_ _f_r_e_q_u_e_n_c_y of one
cycle per second, too low for any practical applications, but an effective
application of the available theory._[_6_] At _B_e_l_l_ _L_a_b_s, _W_i_l_l_i_a_m_ _S_h_o_c_k_l_e_y and A.
Holden started investigating solid-state amplifiers in 1938. The first p‚Äìn
junction in silicon was observed by _R_u_s_s_e_l_l_ _O_h_l about 1941, when a specimen was
found to be light-sensitive, with a sharp boundary between p-type impurity at
one end and n-type at the other. A slice cut from the specimen at the p‚Äìn
boundary developed a voltage when exposed to light.
In France, during the war, _H_e_r_b_e_r_t_ _M_a_t_a_r_√_© had observed amplification between
adjacent point contacts on a germanium base. After the war, Matar√©'s group
announced their "_T_r_a_n_s_i_s_t_r_o_n" amplifier only shortly after Bell Labs announced
the "_t_r_a_n_s_i_s_t_o_r".
