A tteexxttiillee_[_1_] or ccllootthh_[_2_] is a flexible woven material consisting of a network
of natural or artificial _f_i_b_r_e_s often referred to as thread or _y_a_r_n. Yarn is
produced by _s_p_i_n_n_i_n_g raw fibres of _w_o_o_l, _f_l_a_x, _c_o_t_t_o_n, or other material to
produce long strands._[_3_] Textiles are formed by _w_e_a_v_i_n_g, _k_n_i_t_t_i_n_g, _c_r_o_c_h_e_t_i_n_g,
_k_n_o_t_t_i_n_g, or pressing fibres together (_f_e_l_t).
The words ffaabbrriicc and ccllootthh are used in textile assembly trades (such as
_t_a_i_l_o_r_i_n_g and _d_r_e_s_s_m_a_k_i_n_g) as synonyms for textile. However, there are subtle
differences in these terms in specialized usage. Textile refers to any material
made of interlacing fibres. Fabric refers to any material made through weaving,
knitting, spreading, crocheting, or bonding that may be used in production of
further goods (garments, etc.). Cloth may be used synonymously with fabric but
often refers to a finished piece of fabric used for a specific purpose (e.g.,
table cloth).

The word 'textile' is from _L_a_t_i_n, from textilis, meaning 'woven', and textilis
is from textus, the past participle of texere, or 'to weave'._[_4_]
Meanwhile, the word 'fabric' also derives from Latin, most recently from the
Middle _F_r_e_n_c_h fabrique, or 'building, thing made', and earlier as the Latin
fabrica 'workshop; an art, trade; a skillful production, structure, fabric',
which is from the Latin faber, or 'artisan who works in hard materials', from
_P_I_E dhabh-, meaning 'to fit together'._[_5_]
The word 'cloth' derives from the _O_l_d_ _E_n_g_l_i_s_h cla√∞, meaning a cloth, woven or
felted material to wrap around one, from Proto-Germanic kalithaz (compare
O.Frisian 'klath', Middle _D_u_t_c_h 'cleet', Dutch 'kleed', Middle High German
'kleit', and German 'kleid', all meaning "garment")._[_6_] There are several
different types of _f_a_b_r_i_c from two main sources: _m_a_n_m_a_d_e and _n_a_t_u_r_a_l. Inside
natural, there are two others, _p_l_a_n_t and _A_n_i_m_a_l. Some examples of animal
textiles are _s_i_l_k and _w_o_o_l. An example of plants is _c_o_t_t_o_n.

The production of textiles is a craft whose speed and scale of production has
been altered almost beyond recognition by industrialization and the
introduction of modern manufacturing techniques. However, for the main types of
textiles, _p_l_a_i_n_ _w_e_a_v_e, _t_w_i_l_l, or _s_a_t_i_n_ _w_e_a_v_e, there is little difference
between the ancient and modern methods.
Incas have been crafting _q_u_i_p_u_s (or khipus) made of fibres either from a
protein, such as spun and plied thread like wool or hair from camelids such as
_a_l_p_a_c_a_s, _l_l_a_m_a_s, and _c_a_m_e_l_s or from a cellulose like cotton for thousands of
years. Khipus are a series of knots along pieces of string. They have been
believed to only have acted as a form of accounting, although new evidence
conducted by _H_a_r_v_a_r_d professor, _G_a_r_y_ _U_r_t_o_n, indicates there may be more to the
khipu than just numbers. Preservation of khipus found in museum and archive
collections follow general _t_e_x_t_i_l_e_ _p_r_e_s_e_r_v_a_t_i_o_n principles and practice.
During the 15th century, Textiles were the largest single industry.

Textiles have an assortment of uses, the most common of which are for _c_l_o_t_h_i_n_g
and containers such as bags and _b_a_s_k_e_t_s. In the household, they are used in
_c_a_r_p_e_t_i_n_g, upholstered _f_u_r_n_i_s_h_i_n_g_s, _w_i_n_d_o_w_ _s_h_a_d_e_s, _t_o_w_e_l_s, covering for tables,
beds, and other flat surfaces, and in _a_r_t. In the workplace, they are used in
industrial and scientific processes such as filtering. Miscellaneous uses
include _f_l_a_g_s, _b_a_c_k_p_a_c_k_s, _t_e_n_t_s, _n_e_t_s, _h_a_n_d_k_e_r_c_h_i_e_f_s, cleaning _r_a_g_s,

addition to strengthening in _c_o_m_p_o_s_i_t_e_ _m_a_t_e_r_i_a_l_s such as _f_i_b_r_e_g_l_a_s_s and
industrial _g_e_o_t_e_x_t_i_l_e_s. Children can learn using textiles to make _c_o_l_l_a_g_e_s,
_s_e_w, _q_u_i_l_t, and _t_o_y_s.
Textiles used for industrial purposes, and chosen for characteristics other
than their appearance, are commonly referred to as _t_e_c_h_n_i_c_a_l_ _t_e_x_t_i_l_e_s.
Technical textiles include textile structures for automotive applications,
medical textiles (e.g. implants), geotextiles (reinforcement of embankments),
agrotextiles (textiles for _c_r_o_p_ _p_r_o_t_e_c_t_i_o_n), protective clothing (e.g. against
heat and radiation for fire fighter clothing, against molten metals for
welders, stab protection, and _b_u_l_l_e_t proof vests). In all these applications
stringent performance requirements must be met. Woven of threads coated with

Textiles can be made from many materials. These materials come from four main
sources: animal (_w_o_o_l, _s_i_l_k), plant (_c_o_t_t_o_n, _f_l_a_x, _j_u_t_e), mineral (_a_s_b_e_s_t_o_s,
_g_l_a_s_s_ _f_i_b_r_e), and synthetic (_n_y_l_o_n, _p_o_l_y_e_s_t_e_r, _a_c_r_y_l_i_c). In the past, all
textiles were made from natural fibres, including plant, animal, and mineral
sources. In the 20th century, these were supplemented by artificial fibres made
from _p_e_t_r_o_l_e_u_m.
Textiles are made in various strengths and degrees of durability, from the
finest _g_o_s_s_a_m_e_r to the sturdiest _c_a_n_v_a_s. The relative thickness of fibres in
cloth is measured in _d_e_n_i_e_r_s. _M_i_c_r_o_f_i_b_r_e refers to fibres made of strands
thinner than one denier.

Animal textiles are commonly made from _h_a_i_r, _f_u_r or _s_k_i_n.
_W_o_o_l refers to the hair of the domestic _g_o_a_t or _s_h_e_e_p, which is distinguished
from other types of animal hair in that the individual strands are coated with
scales and tightly crimped, and the wool as a whole is coated with a _w_a_x
mixture known as _l_a_n_o_l_i_n (aka wool grease), which is waterproof and dirtproof
[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]. _W_o_o_l_l_e_n refers to a bulkier yarn produced from carded, non-
parallel fibre, while _w_o_r_s_t_e_d refers to a finer yarn which is spun from longer
fibres which have been combed to be parallel. Wool is commonly used for warm
clothing. _C_a_s_h_m_e_r_e, the hair of the Indian _c_a_s_h_m_e_r_e_ _g_o_a_t, and _m_o_h_a_i_r, the hair
of the North African _a_n_g_o_r_a_ _g_o_a_t, are types of wool known for their softness.
Other animal textiles which are made from hair or fur are alpaca wool, _v_i_c_u_√_±_a
_w_o_o_l, llama wool, and camel hair, generally used in the production of _c_o_a_t_s,
_j_a_c_k_e_t_s, _p_o_n_c_h_o_s, _b_l_a_n_k_e_t_s, and other warm coverings. _A_n_g_o_r_a refers to the
long, thick, soft hair of the _a_n_g_o_r_a_ _r_a_b_b_i_t. _Q_i_v_i_u_t is the fine inner wool of
the _m_u_s_k_o_x.
_W_a_d_m_a_l is a coarse cloth made of wool, produced in Scandinavia, mostly
1000~1500CE.
Silk is an animal textile made from the fibres of the _c_o_c_o_o_n of the Chinese
_s_i_l_k_w_o_r_m which is spun into a smooth fabric prized for its softness. There are
two main types of the silk: 'mulberry silk' produced by the Bombyx Mori, and
'wild silk' such as Tussah silk. Silkworm larvae produce the first type if
cultivated in habitats with fresh mulberry leaves for consumption, while Tussah
silk is produced by silkworms feeding purely on oak leaves. Around four-fifths
of the world's silk production consists of cultivated silk._[_1_2_]

_G_r_a_s_s, _r_u_s_h, _h_e_m_p, and _s_i_s_a_l are all used in making _r_o_p_e. In the first two, the
entire plant is used for this purpose, while in the last two, only fibres from
the plant are utilized. _C_o_i_r (_c_o_c_o_n_u_t fibre) is used in making _t_w_i_n_e, and also

_S_t_r_a_w and _b_a_m_b_o_o are both used to make hats. Straw, a dried form of grass, is
also used for stuffing, as is _k_a_p_o_k.
Fibres from _p_u_l_p_w_o_o_d trees, cotton, _r_i_c_e, hemp, and _n_e_t_t_l_e are used in making
_p_a_p_e_r.
_C_o_t_t_o_n, flax, jute, hemp, _m_o_d_a_l and even bamboo fibre are all used in clothing.
_P_i_√_±_a (_p_i_n_e_a_p_p_l_e fibre) and _r_a_m_i_e are also fibres used in clothing, generally
with a blend of other fibres such as cotton. Nettles have also been used to
make a fibre and fabric very similar to hemp or flax. The use of milkweed stalk
fibre has also been reported, but it tends to be somewhat weaker than other
fibres like hemp or flax.
_A_c_e_t_a_t_e is used to increase the shininess of certain fabrics such as silks,
_v_e_l_v_e_t_s, and _t_a_f_f_e_t_a_s.
_S_e_a_w_e_e_d is used in the production of textiles. A water-soluble fibre known as
_a_l_g_i_n_a_t_e is produced and is used as a holding fibre; when the cloth is
finished, the alginate is dissolved, leaving an open area
_L_y_o_c_e_l_l is a man-made fabric derived from wood pulp. It is often described as a
man-made silk equivalent and is a tough fabric which is often blended with
other fabrics ‚Äì cotton for example.
Fibres from the stalks of plants, such as hemp, flax, and nettles, are also
known as 'bast' fibres.

production of _c_l_o_t_h_-_o_f_-_g_o_l_d and _j_e_w_e_l_l_e_r_y. Hardware cloth (US term only) is a
coarse weave of steel wire, used in construction. It is much like standard
_w_i_n_d_o_w_ _s_c_r_e_e_n_i_n_g, but heavier and with a more open weave. It is sometimes used
together with screening on the lower part of screen doors, to resist scratching
by dogs.

All synthetic textiles are used primarily in the production of clothing.
Polyester fibre is used in all types of clothing, either alone or blended with
fibres such as cotton.
_A_r_a_m_i_d fibre (e.g. _T_w_a_r_o_n) is used for flame-retardant clothing, cut-
protection, and armor.
_A_c_r_y_l_i_c is a fibre used to imitate wools, including cashmere, and is often used
in replacement of them.
Nylon is a fibre used to imitate silk; it is used in the production of
_p_a_n_t_y_h_o_s_e. Thicker nylon fibres are used in _r_o_p_e and outdoor clothing.
_S_p_a_n_d_e_x (trade name Lycra) is a _p_o_l_y_u_r_e_t_h_a_n_e product that can be made tight-
fitting without impeding movement. It is used to make activewear, _b_r_a_s, and
_s_w_i_m_s_u_i_t_s.
_O_l_e_f_i_n_ _f_i_b_r_e is a fibre used in activewear, linings, and warm clothing. Olefins
are hydrophobic, allowing them to dry quickly. A sintered felt of olefin fibres
is sold under the trade name _T_y_v_e_k.
_I_n_g_e_o is a _p_o_l_y_l_a_c_t_i_d_e fibre blended with other fibres such as cotton and used
in clothing. It is more hydrophilic than most other synthetics, allowing it to
wick away perspiration.
_L_u_r_e_x is a metallic fibre used in clothing embellishment.
_M_i_l_k proteins have also been used to create synthetic fabric. Milk or _c_a_s_e_i_n
fibre cloth was developed during _W_o_r_l_d_ _W_a_r_ _I in Germany, and further developed
in Italy and America during the 1930s._[_1_4_] Milk fibre fabric is not very
durable and wrinkles easily, but has a pH similar to human skin and possesses
anti-bacterial properties. It is marketed as a _b_i_o_d_e_g_r_a_d_a_b_l_e, _r_e_n_e_w_a_b_l_e
synthetic fibre._[_1_5_]
_C_a_r_b_o_n_ _f_i_b_r_e is mostly used in composite materials, together with resin, such
as _c_a_r_b_o_n_ _f_i_b_r_e_ _r_e_i_n_f_o_r_c_e_d_ _p_l_a_s_t_i_c. The fibres are made from polymer fibres
through carbonization.

_W_e_a_v_i_n_g is a textile production method which involves interlacing a set of
longer _t_h_r_e_a_d_s (called the _w_a_r_p) with a set of crossing threads (called the
_w_e_f_t). This is done on a frame or machine known as a _l_o_o_m, of which there are a
number of types. Some weaving is still done by hand, but the vast majority is
mechanised.
_K_n_i_t_t_i_n_g and crocheting involve interlacing loops of yarn, which are formed
either on a _k_n_i_t_t_i_n_g_ _n_e_e_d_l_e or on a _c_r_o_c_h_e_t_ _h_o_o_k, together in a line. The two
processes are different in that knitting has several active loops at one time,
on the knitting needle waiting to interlock with another loop, while crocheting
never has more than one active loop on the needle.
_S_p_r_e_a_d_ _T_o_w is a production method where the yarn are spread into thin tapes,
and then the tapes are woven as warp and weft. This method is mostly used for
composite materials; _S_p_r_e_a_d_ _T_o_w_ _F_a_b_r_i_c_s can be made in _c_a_r_b_o_n, _a_r_a_m_i_d_e, etc.
_B_r_a_i_d_i_n_g or plaiting involves twisting threads together into cloth. Knotting
involves tying threads together and is used in making _m_a_c_r_a_m_e.
_L_a_c_e is made by interlocking threads together independently, using a backing
and any of the methods described above, to create a fine fabric with open holes
in the work. Lace can be made by either hand or machine.
_C_a_r_p_e_t_s, rugs, velvet, _v_e_l_o_u_r, and _v_e_l_v_e_t_e_e_n are made by interlacing a
secondary yarn through woven cloth, creating a tufted layer known as a _n_a_p or
_p_i_l_e.
Felting involves pressing a mat of fibres together, and working them together
until they become tangled. A liquid, such as soapy water, is usually added to
lubricate the fibres, and to open up the microscopic scales on strands of wool.
_N_o_n_w_o_v_e_n textiles are manufactured by the bonding of fibres to make fabric.
Bonding may be thermal or mechanical, or adhesives can be used.
_B_a_r_k_ _c_l_o_t_h is made by pounding bark until it is soft and flat.

Textiles are often _d_y_e_d, with fabrics available in almost every colour. The
dying process often requires several dozen gallons of water for each pound of
clothing._[_1_7_] Coloured designs in textiles can be created by weaving together
fibres of different colours (_t_a_r_t_a_n or Uzbek Ikat), adding coloured stitches to
finished fabric (_e_m_b_r_o_i_d_e_r_y), creating patterns by _r_e_s_i_s_t_ _d_y_e_i_n_g methods, tying
off areas of cloth and dyeing the rest (_t_i_e_-_d_y_e_i_n_g), or drawing wax designs on
cloth and dyeing in between them (_b_a_t_i_k), or using various printing processes
on finished fabric. _W_o_o_d_b_l_o_c_k_ _p_r_i_n_t_i_n_g, still used in India and elsewhere
today, is the oldest of these dating back to at least 220CE in _C_h_i_n_a. Textiles
are also sometimes _b_l_e_a_c_h_e_d, making the textile pale or white.
Brilliantly dyed traditional woven textiles of _G_u_a_t_e_m_a_l_a, and woman weaving on
a backstrap _l_o_o_m.
Textiles are sometimes finished by chemical processes to change their
characteristics. In the 19th century and early 20th century _s_t_a_r_c_h_i_n_g was
commonly used to make clothing more resistant to stains and wrinkles. Since the
1990s, with advances in technologies such as _p_e_r_m_a_n_e_n_t_ _p_r_e_s_s process, _f_i_n_i_s_h_i_n_g
agents have been used to strengthen fabrics and make them wrinkle free._[_1_8_]
More recently, nanomaterials research has led to additional advancements, with
companies such as Nano-Tex and NanoHorizons developing permanent treatments
based on metallic _n_a_n_o_p_a_r_t_i_c_l_e_s for making textiles more resistant to things
such as water, stains, wrinkles, and pathogens such as bacteria and fungi._[_1_9_]
More so today than ever before, textiles receive a range of treatments before
they reach the end-user. From formaldehyde finishes (to improve crease-
resistance) to biocidic finishes and from flame retardants to dyeing of many
types of fabric, the possibilities are almost endless. However, many of these
finishes may also have detrimental effects on the end user. A number of
disperse, acid and reactive dyes (for example) have been shown to be allergenic
to sensitive individuals._[_2_0_] Further to this, specific dyes within this group
have also been shown to induce purpuric contact dermatitis._[_2_1_]
Although formaldehyde levels in clothing are unlikely to be at levels high
enough to cause an allergic reaction,_[_2_2_] due to the presence of such a
chemical, quality control and testing are of utmost importance. Flame
retardants (mainly in the brominated form) are also of concern where the
environment, and their potential toxicity, are concerned._[_2_3_] Testing for these
additives is possible at a number of commercial laboratories, it is also
possible to have textiles tested for according to the _O_e_k_o_-_t_e_x certification
standard which contains limits levels for the use of certain chemicals in
textiles products.
