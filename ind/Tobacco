dried tobacco leaves, including cigars and cigarettes, snuff, pipe tobacco,
chewing tobacco and flavored shisha. Further uses of tobacco are in plant
bioengineering and as ornamentals, and chemical components of tobacco are used
in some pesticides and medications._[_1_]
The chief commercial species, N. tabacum, is believed to be native to tropical
America, like most nicotiana plants, but has been so long cultivated that it is
no longer known in the wild. N. rustica, a species producing fast-burning
leaves, was the tobacco originally raised in Virginia, but it is now grown
chiefly in Turkey, India, and Russia. The addictive alkaloid _n_i_c_o_t_i_n_e is
popularly considered the most characteristic constituent of tobacco but the
harmful effects of tobacco consumption can also derive from the thousands of
different compounds generated in the smoke, including _p_o_l_y_c_y_c_l_i_c_ _a_r_o_m_a_t_i_c

Tobacco cultivation is similar to other agricultural products. _S_e_e_d_s are sown
in _c_o_l_d_ _f_r_a_m_e_s or hotbeds to prevent attacks from insects, and then
transplanted into the fields. Tobacco is an annual crop, which is usually
harvested mechanically or by hand. After harvest, tobacco is stored for curing,
either by hanging, bundling or placing in large piles with tubular vents to
allow the heat to escape from the center. Curing allows for the slow _o_x_i_d_a_t_i_o_n
and degradation of _c_a_r_o_t_e_n_o_i_d_s. This allows for the agricultural product to
take on properties that are usually attributed to the "smoothness" of the
smoke. Following this, tobacco is packed into its various forms of consumption,
which include smoking, chewing, snuffing, and so on. Most cigarettes
incorporate flue-cured tobacco, which produces a milder, more inhalable smoke.
Use of low-pH, inhalable, flue-cured tobacco is one of the principal reasons
smoking causes lung cancer and other diseases associated with smoke inhalation.
_[_2_]
In consumption, it most commonly appears in the forms of _s_m_o_k_i_n_g, _c_h_e_w_i_n_g,
_s_n_u_f_f_i_n_g, or _d_i_p_p_i_n_g tobacco. Tobacco had long been in use as an _e_n_t_h_e_o_g_e_n in
the Americas, but upon the arrival of _E_u_r_o_p_e_a_n_s in North America, it quickly
became popularized as a trade item and a widely abused drug. This
popularization led to the development of the southern economy of the _U_n_i_t_e_d
_S_t_a_t_e_s until it gave way to cotton. Following the _A_m_e_r_i_c_a_n_ _C_i_v_i_l_ _W_a_r, a change
in demand and production techniques allowed for the development of the
_c_i_g_a_r_e_t_t_e. This new product quickly led to the growth of tobacco companies.
The usage of tobacco is an activity that is practiced by some 1.1 billion
people, and up to 1/3 of the adult population._[_4_] Rates of smoking have leveled
off or declined in _d_e_v_e_l_o_p_e_d_ _c_o_u_n_t_r_i_e_s, but continue to rise in _d_e_v_e_l_o_p_i_n_g

greatest cause of preventable death globally. In a 2008 report, WHO estimated
that it causes 5.4 million deaths per year._[_6_] Tobacco use leads most commonly
to diseases affecting the _h_e_a_r_t, _l_i_v_e_r and _l_u_n_g_s, with smoking being a major

The Spanish and Portuguese word tabaco is thought to have originated in _T_a_i_n_o,
the _A_r_a_w_a_k_a_n language of the _C_a_r_i_b_b_e_a_n. In Taino, it was said to refer either
to a roll of tobacco leaves (according to _B_a_r_t_o_l_o_m_Ã_©_ _d_e_ _l_a_s_ _C_a_s_a_s, 1552), or to
the tabago, a kind of Y-shaped pipe for sniffing tobacco smoke also known as
_s_n_u_f_f (according to Oviedo; with the leaves themselves being referred to as
cohiba)._[_9_]
However, similar words in Spanish, Portuguese and Italian were commonly used
from 1410 to define medicinal _h_e_r_b_s which is believed to be originating from
the _A_r_a_b_i_c Ø·Ø¨Ù tabbaq, a word reportedly dating to the 9th century, as the

The earliest depiction of a European man smoking, from Tabacco by _A_n_t_h_o_n_y
_C_h_u_t_e.
Tobacco had already long been used in the Americas when European settlers
arrived and introduced the practice to Europe, where it became popular. Many
Native American tribes have traditionally grown and used tobacco with some
cultivation sites in Mexico dating back to 1400-1000 B.C._[_1_1_] Eastern North
American tribes carried large amounts of tobacco in pouches as a readily
accepted trade item, and often smoked it in _p_e_a_c_e_ _p_i_p_e_s, either in defined
sacred ceremonies, or to seal a bargain,_[_1_2_] and they smoked it at such
occasions in all stages of life, even in childhood._[_1_3_] It was believed that
tobacco is a gift from the Creator, and that the exhaled tobacco smoke carries
one's thoughts and prayers to _h_e_a_v_e_n._[_1_4_]
Before the development of lighter Virginia and White Burley strains of tobacco,
the smoke was too harsh to be inhaled traditionally by Native Americans in
ceremonial use or by Europeans who used it in the form of pipes and cigars._[_1_5_]
Inhaling "rough" tobacco without seriously damaging the lungs in the short term

Association, 1859.
Following the arrival of the Europeans, tobacco became increasingly popular as
a trade item. It fostered the _e_c_o_n_o_m_y for the _s_o_u_t_h_e_r_n_ _U_n_i_t_e_d_ _S_t_a_t_e_s until it
was replaced by cotton. Following the American civil war, a change in demand
and a change in labor force allowed inventor _J_a_m_e_s_ _B_o_n_s_a_c_k to create a machine
that automated cigarette production.
This increase in production allowed tremendous growth in the _t_o_b_a_c_c_o_ _i_n_d_u_s_t_r_y
until the scientific revelations of the mid-20th century.

Following the scientific revelations of the mid-20th century, tobacco became
condemned as a health hazard, and eventually became encompassed as a cause for
cancer, as well as other respiratory and circulatory diseases. In the United
States, this led to the _T_o_b_a_c_c_o_ _M_a_s_t_e_r_ _S_e_t_t_l_e_m_e_n_t_ _A_g_r_e_e_m_e_n_t (MSA), which
settled the lawsuit in exchange for a combination of yearly payments to the
states and voluntary restrictions on advertising and marketing of tobacco
products.
In the 1970s, _B_r_o_w_n_ _&_ _W_i_l_l_i_a_m_s_o_n cross-bred a strain of tobacco to produce _Y_1.
This strain of tobacco contained an unusually high amount of nicotine, nearly
doubling its content from 3.2-3.5% to 6.5%. In the 1990s, this prompted the
_F_o_o_d_ _a_n_d_ _D_r_u_g_ _A_d_m_i_n_i_s_t_r_a_t_i_o_n (FDA) to use this strain as evidence that _t_o_b_a_c_c_o
_c_o_m_p_a_n_i_e_s were intentionally manipulating the nicotine content of _c_i_g_a_r_e_t_t_e_s.
In 2003, in response to growth of tobacco use in developing countries, the
World Health Organization (WHO)_[_1_6_] successfully rallied 168 countries to sign
the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. The Convention is designed to push
for effective legislation and its enforcement in all countries to reduce the
harmful effects of tobacco. This led to the development of tobacco cessation
products.

There are many species of tobacco in the genus of herbs Nicotiana. It is part
of the nightshade _f_a_m_i_l_y (_S_o_l_a_n_a_c_e_a_e) indigenous to _N_o_r_t_h and _S_o_u_t_h_ _A_m_e_r_i_c_a,

Many plants contain _n_i_c_o_t_i_n_e, a powerful _n_e_u_r_o_t_o_x_i_n to _i_n_s_e_c_t_s. However,
tobaccos contain a higher concentration of nicotine than most other plants.
Unlike many other Solanaceae, they do not contain _t_r_o_p_a_n_e_ _a_l_k_a_l_o_i_d_s, which are
often poisonous to humans and other animals.
Despite containing enough nicotine and other compounds such as _g_e_r_m_a_c_r_e_n_e and
_a_n_a_b_a_s_i_n_e and other _p_i_p_e_r_i_d_i_n_e alkaloids (varying between species) to deter

on Nicotiana species without being harmed. Nonetheless, tobacco is unpalatable
to many species, and accordingly some tobacco plants (chiefly _t_r_e_e_ _t_o_b_a_c_c_o, N.
glauca) have become established as _i_n_v_a_s_i_v_e_ _w_e_e_d_s in some places.

There are a number of types of tobacco including, but are not limited to:
    * _A_r_o_m_a_t_i_c_ _f_i_r_e_-_c_u_r_e_d is cured by smoke from open fires. In the United
      States, it is grown in northern middle Tennessee, central Kentucky and in
      _V_i_r_g_i_n_i_a. Fire-cured tobacco grown in _K_e_n_t_u_c_k_y and _T_e_n_n_e_s_s_e_e are used in
      some chewing tobaccos, moist snuff, some cigarettes, and as a condiment
      in pipe tobacco blends. Another fire-cured tobacco is _L_a_t_a_k_i_a, which is
      produced from oriental varieties of N. tabacum. The leaves are cured and
      smoked over smoldering fires of local hardwoods and aromatic shrubs in
      _C_y_p_r_u_s and _S_y_r_i_a.
    * _B_r_i_g_h_t_l_e_a_f_ _t_o_b_a_c_c_o, Brightleaf is commonly known as "Virginia tobacco",
      often regardless of the state where they are planted. Prior to the
      _A_m_e_r_i_c_a_n_ _C_i_v_i_l_ _W_a_r, most tobacco grown in the US was fire-cured dark-
      leaf. This type of tobacco was planted in fertile lowlands, used a robust
      variety of leaf, and was either fire cured or air cured. Most Canadian
      cigarettes are made from 100% pure Virginia tobacco._[_1_8_]
    * _B_u_r_l_e_y_ _t_o_b_a_c_c_o, is an air-cured tobacco used primarily for _c_i_g_a_r_e_t_t_e
      production. In the U.S., burley tobacco plants are started from
      palletized seeds placed in polystyrene trays floated on a bed of
      fertilized water in March or April.
    * _C_a_v_e_n_d_i_s_h is more a process of curing and a method of cutting tobacco
      than a type. The processing and the cut are used to bring out the natural
      sweet taste in the tobacco. Cavendish can be produced from any tobacco
      type, but is usually one of, or a blend of _K_e_n_t_u_c_k_y, _V_i_r_g_i_n_i_a, and
      _b_u_r_l_e_y, and is most commonly used for pipe tobacco and cigars.
    * _C_r_i_o_l_l_o_ _t_o_b_a_c_c_o is a type of tobacco, primarily used in the making of
      _c_i_g_a_r_s. It was, by most accounts, one of the original _C_u_b_a_n tobaccos that
      emerged around the time of _C_o_l_u_m_b_u_s.
    * _D_o_k_h_a, is a tobacco originally grown in _I_r_a_n, mixed with leaves, bark,
      and herbs for smoking in a _m_i_d_w_a_k_h.
    * _T_u_r_k_i_s_h_ _t_o_b_a_c_c_o, is a sun-cured, highly aromatic, small-leafed variety
      (_N_i_c_o_t_i_a_n_a_ _t_a_b_a_c_u_m) that is grown in _T_u_r_k_e_y, _G_r_e_e_c_e, _B_u_l_g_a_r_i_a, and
      _M_a_c_e_d_o_n_i_a. Originally grown in regions historically part of the _O_t_t_o_m_a_n
      _E_m_p_i_r_e, it is also known as "oriental". Many of the early brands of
      cigarettes were made mostly or entirely of Turkish tobacco; today, its
      main use is in blends of pipe and especially cigarette tobacco (a typical
      American cigarette is a blend of bright Virginia, burley and Turkish).
    * _P_e_r_i_q_u_e, a farmer called Pierre Chenet is credited with first turning
      this local tobacco into the Perique in 1824 through the technique of
      pressure-fermentation. Considered the _t_r_u_f_f_l_e of _p_i_p_e tobaccos, it is
      used as a component in many blended pipe tobaccos, but is too strong to
      be smoked pure. At one time, the freshly moist Perique was also chewed,
      but none is now sold for this purpose. It is typically blended with pure
      Virginia to lend spice, strength, and coolness to the blend.
    * _S_h_a_d_e_ _t_o_b_a_c_c_o, is cultivated in _C_o_n_n_e_c_t_i_c_u_t and _M_a_s_s_a_c_h_u_s_e_t_t_s. Early
      Connecticut _c_o_l_o_n_i_s_t_s acquired from the Native Americans the habit of
      smoking tobacco in pipes, and began cultivating the plant commercially,
      even though the _P_u_r_i_t_a_n_s referred to it as the "evil weed". The
      _C_o_n_n_e_c_t_i_c_u_t_ _s_h_a_d_e industry has weathered some major _c_a_t_a_s_t_r_o_p_h_e_s,
      including a devastating _h_a_i_l_s_t_o_r_m in 1929, and an epidemic of brown spot
      fungus in 2000, but is now in danger of disappearing altogether, given
      the value of the land to real estate speculators.
    * _W_h_i_t_e_ _b_u_r_l_e_y, in 1865, George Webb of _B_r_o_w_n_ _C_o_u_n_t_y, _O_h_i_o planted red
      _b_u_r_l_e_y seeds he had purchased, and found that a few of the seedlings had
      a whitish, sickly look. The air-cured leaf was found to be more mild than
      other types of tobacco.
    * _W_i_l_d_ _t_o_b_a_c_c_o, is native to the southwestern United States, _M_e_x_i_c_o, and
      parts of _S_o_u_t_h_ _A_m_e_r_i_c_a. Its botanical name is Nicotiana rustica.
    * _Y_1 is a strain of tobacco _c_r_o_s_s_-_b_r_e_d by _B_r_o_w_n_ _&_ _W_i_l_l_i_a_m_s_o_n in the 1970s

Smoking in public was for a long time something reserved for men, and when done
by women was sometimes associated with _p_r_o_m_i_s_c_u_i_t_y.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] In Japan,

Tobacco is cultivated similarly to other agricultural products. _S_e_e_d_s were at
first quickly scattered onto the soil. However, young plants came under
increasing attack from _f_l_e_a_ _b_e_e_t_l_e_s (Epitrix cucumeris or Epitrix pubescens),
which caused destruction of half the tobacco crops in United States in 1876. By
1890 successful experiments were conducted that placed the plant in a frame
covered by thin cotton fabric. Today, tobacco is sown in _c_o_l_d_ _f_r_a_m_e_s or
hotbeds, as their _g_e_r_m_i_n_a_t_i_o_n is activated by light.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]
In the _U_n_i_t_e_d_ _S_t_a_t_e_s, tobacco is often fertilized with the mineral _a_p_a_t_i_t_e,
which partially starves the plant of _n_i_t_r_o_g_e_n, to produce a more desired
flavor.
After the plants are about eight inches tall, they are transplanted into the
fields. Farmers used to have to wait for rainy weather to plant. A hole is
created in the tilled earth with a tobacco peg, either a curved wooden tool or
deer antler. After making two holes to the right and left - you would move
forward two feet, select plants from your bag and repeat. Various mechanical
tobacco planters like Bemis, New Idea Setter, and New Holland Transplanter were
invented in the late 19th and 20th centuries to automate the process: making
the hole, watering it, guiding the plant in â all in one motion.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n

Tobacco is cultivated annually, and can be _h_a_r_v_e_s_t_e_d in several ways. In the
oldest method still used today, the entire plant is harvested at once by
cutting off the stalk at the ground with a tobacco knife. It is then speared
onto sticks, four to six plants a stick and hung in a curing barn. In the 19th
century, bright tobacco began to be harvested by pulling individual leaves off
the stalk as they ripened. The leaves ripen from the ground upwards, so a field
of tobacco harvested in this manner will involve the serial harvest of a number
of "primings," beginning with the _v_o_l_a_d_o leaves near the ground, working to the
_s_e_c_o leaves in the middle of the plant, and finishing with the potent _l_i_g_e_r_o
leaves at the top. Before this the crop needs to be topped when the pink
flowers develop. Topping always refers to the removal of the tobacco flower
before the leaves are systematically removed and, eventually, entirely
harvested. As the industrial revolution took hold, harvesting wagons used to
transport leaves were equipped with man-powered stringers, an apparatus that
used twine to attach leaves to a pole. In modern times, large fields are
harvested mechanically, although topping the flower and in some cases the
plucking of immature leaves is still done by hand. Most tobacco in the U.S. is
grown in North Carolina, Kentucky, and Virginia._[_3_7_]

Curing and subsequent aging allow for the slow _o_x_i_d_a_t_i_o_n and degradation of
_c_a_r_o_t_e_n_o_i_d_s in tobacco leaf. This produces certain compounds in the tobacco
leaves, and gives a sweet hay, _t_e_a, _r_o_s_e_ _o_i_l, or fruity aromatic flavor that
contributes to the "smoothness" of the smoke. Starch is converted to sugar,

(AGEs), a _c_a_r_a_m_e_l_i_z_a_t_i_o_n process that also adds flavor. Inhalation of these

Tobacco can be cured through several methods, including:
    * _AA_ii_rr_ _cc_uu_rr_ee_dd tobacco is hung in well-ventilated barns and allowed to dry
      over a period of four to eight weeks. Air-cured tobacco is low in sugar,
      which gives the tobacco smoke a light, mild flavor, and high in nicotine.
      Cigar and burley tobaccos are 'Dark' air cured._[_3_9_]
    * _FF_ii_rr_ee_ _cc_uu_rr_ee_dd tobacco is hung in large barns where fires of hardwoods are
      kept on continuous or intermittent low smoulder and takes between three
      days and ten weeks, depending on the process and the tobacco. Fire curing
      produces a tobacco low in sugar and high in nicotine. Pipe tobacco,
      chewing tobacco, and snuff are fire cured.
    * _FF_ll_uu_ee_ _cc_uu_rr_ee_dd tobacco was originally strung onto tobacco sticks, which were
      hung from tier-poles in curing barns (Aus: _k_i_l_n_s, also traditionally
      called _O_a_s_t_s). These barns have flues run from externally fed fire boxes,
      heat-curing the tobacco without exposing it to smoke, slowly raising the
      temperature over the course of the curing. The process generally takes
      about a week. This method produces cigarette tobacco that is high in
      sugar and has medium to high levels of nicotine.
    * _SS_uu_nn_--_cc_uu_rr_ee_dd tobacco dries uncovered in the sun. This method is used in
      Turkey, Greece and other Mediterranean countries to produce oriental
      tobacco. Sun-cured tobacco is low in sugar and nicotine and is used in
      cigarettes.

Tobacco is consumed in many forms and through a number of different methods.
Below are examples including, but not limited to, such forms and usage.
    * _BB_ee_ee_dd_ii are thin, often flavored cigarettes from _I_n_d_i_a made of tobacco
      wrapped in a _t_e_n_d_u leaf, and secured with colored thread at one end.
    * _CC_hh_ee_ww_ii_nn_gg_ _tt_oo_bb_aa_cc_cc_oo is the oldest way of consuming tobacco leaves. It is
      consumed orally, in two forms: through sweetened strands, or in a
      shredded form. When consuming the long sweetened strands, the tobacco is
      lightly chewed and compacted into a ball. When consuming the shredded
      tobacco, small amounts are placed at the bottom lip, between the gum and
      the teeth, where it is gently compacted, thus it can often be called
      dipping tobacco. Both methods stimulate the saliva glands, which led to
      the development of the _s_p_i_t_t_o_o_n.
    * _CC_ii_gg_aa_rr_ss are tightly rolled bundles of dried and fermented tobacco, which
      is ignited so its smoke may be drawn into the smoker's mouth.
    * _CC_ii_gg_aa_rr_ee_tt_tt_ee_ss are a product consumed through inhalation of smoke and
      manufactured from cured and finely cut tobacco leaves and reconstituted
      tobacco, often combined with other additives, then rolled or stuffed into
      a paper cylinder.
    * _CC_rr_ee_aa_mm_yy_ _ss_nn_uu_ff_ff_ss are tobacco paste, consisting of tobacco, clove oil,
      glycerin, spearmint, menthol, and camphor, and sold in a toothpaste tube.
      It is marketed mainly to women in _I_n_d_i_a, and is known by the brand names
      Ipco (made by Asha Industries), Denobac, Tona, _G_a_n_e_s_h. It is locally
      known as "mishri" in some parts of Maharashtra.
    * _DD_ii_pp_pp_ii_nn_gg_ _tt_oo_bb_aa_cc_cc_oo_ss are a form of _s_m_o_k_e_l_e_s_s_ _t_o_b_a_c_c_o. Dip is occasionally
      referred to as "chew", and because of this, it is commonly confused with
      _c_h_e_w_i_n_g_ _t_o_b_a_c_c_o, which encompasses a wider range of products. A small
      clump of dip is 'pinched' out of the tin and placed between the lower or
      upper lip and gums.
    * _GG_uu_tt_kk_aa is a preparation of crushed betel nut, tobacco, and sweet or savory
      flavorings. It is manufactured in India and exported to a few other
      countries. A mild stimulant, it is sold across India in small,
      individual-size packets.
    * _HH_oo_oo_kk_aa_hh is a single or multi-stemmed (often glass-based) water pipe for
      smoking. Originally from India, the hookah has gained immense popularity,
      especially in the Middle East. A hookah operates by water filtration and
      indirect heat. It can be used for smoking herbal fruits or _m_o_a_s_s_e_l, a
      mixture of tobacco, flavouring and _h_o_n_e_y or _g_l_y_c_e_r_i_n.
    * _KK_rr_ee_tt_ee_kk_ss are cigarettes made with a complex blend of tobacco, cloves and a
      flavoring "sauce". It was first introduced in the 1880s in Kudus, Java,
      to deliver the medicinal _e_u_g_e_n_o_l of cloves to the lungs.
    * _RR_oo_ll_ll_--_YY_oo_uu_rr_--_OO_ww_nn, often called rollies or roll ups, are very popular,
      particularly in European countries. These are prepared from loose
      tobacco, cigarette papers and filters all bought separately. They are
      usually much cheaper to make.
    * _PP_ii_pp_ee_ _ss_mm_oo_kk_ii_nn_gg typically consists of a small chamber (the bowl) for the
      combustion of the tobacco to be smoked and a thin stem (shank) that ends
      in a mouthpiece (the bit). Shredded pieces of tobacco are placed into the
      chamber and ignited.
    * _SS_nn_uu_ff_ff is a ground smokeless tobacco product, inhaled or "snuffed" through
      the nose. If referring specifically to the orally consumed moist snuff
      see _d_i_p_p_i_n_g_ _t_o_b_a_c_c_o.
    * _SS_nn_uu_ss is a steam-cured moist powder _t_o_b_a_c_c_o product that is not fermented,
      and does not induce salivation. It is consumed by placing it in the mouth
      against the gums for an extended period of time. It is a form of _s_n_u_f_f
      used in a manner similar to American _d_i_p_p_i_n_g_ _t_o_b_a_c_c_o, but does not
      require regular spitting.
    * _TT_oo_pp_ii_cc_aa_ll_ _tt_oo_bb_aa_cc_cc_oo_ _pp_aa_ss_tt_ee is sometimes recommended as a treatment for _w_a_s_p,

      the contents of a cigarette is mashed in a cup with about a 0.5 to 1
      teaspoon of water to make a paste that is then applied to the affected
      area.
    * _TT_oo_bb_aa_cc_cc_oo_ _ww_aa_tt_ee_rr is a traditional _o_r_g_a_n_i_c _i_n_s_e_c_t_i_c_i_d_e used in domestic
      _g_a_r_d_e_n_i_n_g. Tobacco dust can be used similarly. It is produced by boiling
      strong tobacco in water, or by steeping the tobacco in water for a longer
      period. When cooled, the mixture can be applied as a spray, or 'painted'
      on to the leaves of garden plants, where it kills insects. Tobacco is
      however banned from use as pesticide in certified organic production.[_b_y

Tobacco production in _P_o_r_t_u_g_u_e_s_e_ _T_i_m_o_r in the 1930s
Production of tobacco leaf increased by 40% between 1971, during which 4.2
million tons of leaf were produced, and 1997, during which 5.9 million tons of
leaf were produced._[_4_2_] According to the Food and Agriculture organization of
the UN, tobacco leaf production was expected to hit 7.1 million tons by 2010.
This number is a bit lower than the record high production of 1992, during
which 7.5 million tons of leaf were produced._[_4_3_] The production growth was
almost entirely due to increased productivity by developing nations, where
production increased by 128%._[_4_4_] During that same time period, production in
developing countries actually decreased._[_4_3_] Chinaâs increase in tobacco
production was the single biggest factor in the increase in world production.
Chinaâs share of the world market increased from 17% in 1971 to 47% in 1997.
_[_4_2_] This growth can be partially explained by the existence of a high import
tariff on foreign tobacco entering China. While this tariff has been reduced
from 64% in 1999 to 10% in 2004,_[_4_5_] it still has led to local, Chinese
cigarettes being preferred over foreign cigarettes because of their lower cost.
Every year 6.7 million tons of tobacco are produced throughout the world. The
top producers of tobacco are China (39.6%), India (8.3%), Brazil (7.0%) and the
United States (4.6%)._[_4_6_]

Around the peak of global tobacco production there were 20 million rural
Chinese households producing tobacco on 2.1 million hectares of land._[_4_7_] While
it is the major crop for millions of Chinese farmers, growing tobacco is not as
profitable as cotton or sugar cane. This is because the Chinese government sets
the market price. While this price is guaranteed, it is lower than the natural
market price, because of the lack of market risk. To further control tobacco in
their borders, China founded a State Tobacco Monopoly Administration (STMA) in
1982. STMA control tobacco production, marketing, imports and exports and
contributes 12% to the nation's national income._[_4_8_] As noted above, despite
the income generated for the state by profits from state-owned tobacco
companies and the taxes paid by companies and retailers, China's government has
acted to reduce tobacco use._[_4_9_]

In Brazil around 135,000 family farmers cite tobacco production as their main
economic activity._[_4_7_] Tobacco has never exceeded 0.7% of the countryâs total
cultivated area._[_5_0_] In the southern regions of Brazil, Virginia and Amarelinho
flue-cured tobacco as well as Burley and Galpao Comun air-cured tobacco are
produced. These types of tobacco are used for cigarettes. In the northeast,
darker, air- and sun-cured tobacco is grown. These types of tobacco are used
for cigars, twists and dark-cigarettes._[_5_0_] Brazilâs government has made
attempts to reduce the production of tobacco, but has not had a successful
systematic anti-tobacco farming initiative. Brazilâs government, however,
provides small loans for family farms, including those that grow tobacco,
through the Programa Nacional de Fortalecimento da Agricultura Familiar
(PRONAF)._[_5_1_]

_C_h_e_n_n_a_i, _T_a_m_i_l_ _N_a_d_u), _A_n_d_h_r_a_ _P_r_a_d_e_s_h, _P_u_n_j_a_b, _B_i_h_a_r, _M_y_s_o_r_e, _W_e_s_t_ _B_e_n_g_a_l, and
_R_a_j_a_m_u_n_d_r_y._[_5_3_] Rajahmundry houses the core research institute. The government
has set up a Central Tobacco Promotion Council, which works to increase exports
of Indian tobacco.
The Indian Government and several states have taken multiple measures to reduce
Cigarette smoking. Smoking in public places is banned in many states, it is not
allowed to be portrayed in movies, and warnings are posted on cigarette packs.

Tobacco in the Philippines remained highly concentrated in 2009 and dominated
by cigarette manufacturers _F_o_r_t_u_n_e_ _T_o_b_a_c_c_o Corporation and _P_h_i_l_i_p_ _M_o_r_r_i_s
_I_n_t_e_r_n_a_t_i_o_n_a_l. The strength of these companies is due to their extensive
distribution networks which encompass both traditional and non-traditional
retail channels as well as their ability to offer their products at affordable
prices. Top player Fortune Tobacco Corp maintained its leadership position
throughout the review period as mass market cigarette smokers continued to
purchase its economy cigarette brands, particularly leading brand Fortune
International._[_5_6_]
Cigarette prices in the Philippines are low, with the price of _M_a_r_l_b_o_r_o_ 
_(_c_i_g_a_r_e_t_t_e_) being the second lowest for all ASEAN nations. The cigarette market
has been dominated by menthol brands for several decades, although non-menthol
volume has been steadily improving in recent years. La Suerte Cigar and
Cigarette Company and the _F_o_r_t_u_n_e_ _T_o_b_a_c_c_o Corporation (FTC) have been the two
leading producers, and have had licensing agreements with PMI and RJ Reynolds

The International Labour Office reported that the most child-laborers work in
agriculture, which is one of the most hazardous types of work._[_5_7_] The tobacco
industry houses some of these working children. There is widespread use of
children on farms in Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Malawi and
Zimbabwe._[_5_8_] While some of these children work with their families on small
family-owned farms, others work on large plantations. In late 2009 reports were
released by the London-based human-rights group Plan International, claiming
that child labor was common on Malawi (producer of 1.8% of the worldâs
tobacco_[_4_2_]) tobacco farms. The organization interviewed 44 teens, who worked
full-time on farms during the 2007-2008 growing season. The child-laborers
complained of low pay, long hours as well as physical and sexual abuse by their
supervisors._[_5_9_] They also reported suffering from âgreen tobacco
sickness,â a form of nicotine poisoning. When wet leaves are handled,
nicotine from the leaves gets absorbed in the skin and causes nausea, vomiting
and dizziness. Children were exposed to 50 cigarettes worth of nicotine through
direct contact with tobacco leaves. This level of nicotine in children can
permanently alter brain structure and function._[_5_7_]

manufacturing facilities in at least 50 countries and buy crude tobacco leaf
from at least 12 more countries._[_6_0_] This encouragement, along with government
subsidies has led to a glut in the tobacco market. This surplus has resulted in
lower prices, which are devastating to small-scale tobacco farmers. According
to the World Bank, between 1985 and 2000 the inflation-adjusted price of
tobacco dropped 37%._[_6_1_] Tobacco is the most widely _s_m_u_g_g_l_e_d legal product._[_6_2_]

Tobacco production requires the use of a large amount of _p_e_s_t_i_c_i_d_e_s. Tobacco
companies recommend up to 16 separate applications of pesticides just in the
period between planting the seeds in greenhouses and transplanting the young
plants to the field._[_6_3_] Pesticide use has been worsened by the desire to
produce larger crops in less time because of the decreasing market value of
tobacco. Pesticides often harm tobacco farmers because they are unaware of the
health effects and the proper safety protocol for working with pesticides.
These pesticides, as well as fertilizers, end up in the soil, waterways, and
the food chain._[_6_4_] Coupled with child labor, pesticides pose an even greater
threat. Early exposure to pesticides may increase a child's lifelong cancer
risk as well as harm his or her nervous and immune systems._[_6_5_]
Tobacco is a crop that extracts nutrients, such as _p_h_o_s_p_h_o_r_u_s, _n_i_t_r_o_g_e_n and
_p_o_t_a_s_s_i_u_m, from the soil more quickly than any other major crop._[_6_6_] This leads
to dependence on fertilizers.
Furthermore, the wood used to cure tobacco in some places leads to
deforestation. While some big tobacco producers such as China and the United
States have access to petroleum, coal and natural gas, which can be used as
alternatives to wood, most developing countries still rely on wood in the
curing process._[_6_6_] Brazil alone uses the wood of 60 million trees per year for
curing, packaging and rolling cigarettes._[_6_3_]

Because of its importance as a research tool (see above), transgenic tobacco
was the first GM crop to be tested in field trials, in the United States and
France in 1986; China became the first country in the world to approve
commercial planting of a GM crop in 1993, which was tobacco._[_7_0_]

Many varieties of transgenic tobacco have been intensively tested in field
trials. Agronomic traits such as resistance to pathogens (viruses, particularly
to the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV); fungi; bacteria and nematodes); weed
management via herbicide tolerance; resistance against insect pests; resistance
to drought and cold; and production of useful products such as pharmaceuticals;
and use of GM plants for bioremediation, have all been tested in over 400 field
trials using tobacco._[_7_1_]
