TTrraannssppoorrtt or ttrraannssppoorrttaattiioonn is the movement of people, animals and _g_o_o_d_s from
one location to another. _M_o_d_e_s_ _o_f_ _t_r_a_n_s_p_o_r_t include _a_i_r, _r_a_i_l, _r_o_a_d, _w_a_t_e_r,
_c_a_b_l_e, _p_i_p_e_l_i_n_e and _s_p_a_c_e. The field can be divided into _i_n_f_r_a_s_t_r_u_c_t_u_r_e,
_v_e_h_i_c_l_e_s and _o_p_e_r_a_t_i_o_n_s. Transport is important since it enables trade between
people, which in turn establishes civilizations.
Transport infrastructure consists of the fixed installations necessary for
transport, including _r_o_a_d_s, _r_a_i_l_w_a_y_s, _a_i_r_w_a_y_s, _w_a_t_e_r_w_a_y_s, _c_a_n_a_l_s and _p_i_p_e_l_i_n_e_s
and terminals such as _a_i_r_p_o_r_t_s, _r_a_i_l_w_a_y_ _s_t_a_t_i_o_n_s, _b_u_s_ _s_t_a_t_i_o_n_s, _w_a_r_e_h_o_u_s_e_s,
trucking terminals, refueling depots (including fueling docks and _f_u_e_l
_s_t_a_t_i_o_n_s) and _s_e_a_p_o_r_t_s. Terminals may be used both for interchange of
passengers and cargo and for maintenance.
Vehicles traveling on these networks may include _a_u_t_o_m_o_b_i_l_e_s, _b_i_c_y_c_l_e_s, _b_u_s_e_s,
_t_r_a_i_n_s, _t_r_u_c_k_s, _p_e_o_p_l_e, _h_e_l_i_c_o_p_t_e_r_s and _a_i_r_c_r_a_f_t. Operations deal with the way
the vehicles are operated, and the procedures set for this purpose including
financing, legalities and policies. In the transport industry, operations and
ownership of infrastructure can be either public or private, depending on the
country and mode.
Passenger transport may be _p_u_b_l_i_c, where operators provide scheduled services,
or _p_r_i_v_a_t_e. Freight transport has become focused on _c_o_n_t_a_i_n_e_r_i_z_a_t_i_o_n, although
_b_u_l_k_ _t_r_a_n_s_p_o_r_t is used for large volumes of durable items. Transport plays an
important part in economic growth and globalization, but most types cause _a_i_r
_p_o_l_l_u_t_i_o_n and _u_s_e_ _l_a_r_g_e_ _a_m_o_u_n_t_s_ _o_f_ _l_a_n_d. While it is heavily subsidized by
governments, good planning of transport is essential to make traffic flow and
restrain _u_r_b_a_n_ _s_p_r_a_w_l.

A mode of transport is a solution that makes use of a particular type of
vehicle, infrastructure and operation. The transport of a person or of cargo
may involve one mode or several of the modes, with the latter case being called
intermodal or multimodal transport. Each mode has its own advantages and
disadvantages, and will be chosen for a trip on the basis of cost, capability,
route and speed.

Human powered transport is the transport of people and/or goods using _h_u_m_a_n
muscle-power, in the form of _w_a_l_k_i_n_g, _r_u_n_n_i_n_g and _s_w_i_m_m_i_n_g. Modern _t_e_c_h_n_o_l_o_g_y
has allowed _m_a_c_h_i_n_e_s to enhance human-power. Human-powered transport remains
popular for reasons of cost-saving, _l_e_i_s_u_r_e, _p_h_y_s_i_c_a_l_ _e_x_e_r_c_i_s_e and
_e_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t_a_l_i_s_m. Human-powered transport is sometimes the only type available,
especially in underdeveloped or inaccessible regions. It is considered an ideal
form of _s_u_s_t_a_i_n_a_b_l_e_ _t_r_a_n_s_p_o_r_t_a_t_i_o_n.
Although humans are able to walk without infrastructure, the transport can be
enhanced through the use of roads, especially when using the human power with
vehicles, such as bicycles and _i_n_l_i_n_e_ _s_k_a_t_e_s. Human-powered vehicles have also

A _f_i_x_e_d_-_w_i_n_g_ _a_i_r_c_r_a_f_t, commonly called airplane, is a heavier-than-air craft
where movement of the air in relation to the wings is used to generate lift.
The term is used to distinguish from _r_o_t_a_r_y_-_w_i_n_g_ _a_i_r_c_r_a_f_t, where the movement
of the lift surfaces relative to the air generates lift. A _g_y_r_o_p_l_a_n_e is both
fixed-wing and rotary-wing. Fixed-wing aircraft range from small trainers and
recreational aircraft to large _a_i_r_l_i_n_e_r_s and military cargo aircraft.
Two things necessary for aircraft are air flow over the wings for _l_i_f_t and an
area for _l_a_n_d_i_n_g. The majority of aircraft also need an _a_i_r_p_o_r_t with the
infrastructure to receive maintenance, restocking, refueling and for the
loading and unloading of crew, cargo and passengers. While the vast majority of
aircraft land and take off on land, some are capable of take off and landing on
ice, snow and calm water.
The aircraft is the second fastest method of transport, after the _r_o_c_k_e_t.
Commercial jets can reach up to 955 kilometres per hour (593 mph), single-
engine aircraft 555 kilometres per hour (345 mph). Aviation is able to quickly
transport people and limited amounts of cargo over longer distances, but incur
high costs and energy use; for short distances or in inaccessible places
_h_e_l_i_c_o_p_t_e_r_s can be used._[_1_] As of April 28, 2009 The Guardian article notes
that, "the WHO estimates that up to 500,000 people are on planes at any time."

Rail transport is where a _t_r_a_i_n runs along a set of two parallel _s_t_e_e_l _r_a_i_l_s,
known as a railway or railroad. The rails are anchored _p_e_r_p_e_n_d_i_c_u_l_a_r to _t_i_e_s
(or sleepers) of timber, concrete or steel, to maintain a consistent distance
apart, or _g_a_u_g_e. The rails and perpendicular beams are placed on a foundation
made of concrete, or compressed _e_a_r_t_h and _g_r_a_v_e_l in a bed of ballast.
Alternative methods include _m_o_n_o_r_a_i_l and _m_a_g_l_e_v.
A train consists of one or more connected vehicles that run on the rails.
Propulsion is commonly provided by a _l_o_c_o_m_o_t_i_v_e, that hauls a series of
unpowered cars, that can carry passengers or freight. The locomotive can be
powered by _s_t_e_a_m, _d_i_e_s_e_l or by _e_l_e_c_t_r_i_c_i_t_y supplied by _t_r_a_c_k_s_i_d_e_ _s_y_s_t_e_m_s.
Alternatively, some or all the cars can be powered, known as a _m_u_l_t_i_p_l_e_ _u_n_i_t.
Also, a train can be powered by _h_o_r_s_e_s, _c_a_b_l_e_s, _g_r_a_v_i_t_y, _p_n_e_u_m_a_t_i_c_s and _g_a_s
_t_u_r_b_i_n_e_s. Railed vehicles move with much less friction than rubber tires on
paved roads, making trains more _e_n_e_r_g_y_ _e_f_f_i_c_i_e_n_t, though not as efficient as
ships.

built track. _R_e_g_i_o_n_a_l and _c_o_m_m_u_t_e_r trains feed cities from suburbs and
surrounding areas, while intra-urban transport is performed by high-capacity

transport. Freight trains traditionally used _b_o_x_ _c_a_r_s, requiring manual loading
and unloading of the _c_a_r_g_o. Since the 1960s, container trains have become the
dominant solution for general freight, while large quantities of bulk are
transported by dedicated trains.

A road is an identifiable _r_o_u_t_e, way or _p_a_t_h between two or more _p_l_a_c_e_s._[_4_]
Roads are typically smoothed, _p_a_v_e_d, or otherwise prepared to allow easy
travel;_[_5_] though they need not be, and historically many roads were simply
recognizable routes without any formal _c_o_n_s_t_r_u_c_t_i_o_n or _m_a_i_n_t_e_n_a_n_c_e._[_6_] In _u_r_b_a_n
_a_r_e_a_s, roads may pass through a _c_i_t_y or _v_i_l_l_a_g_e and be named as _s_t_r_e_e_t_s,
serving a dual function as urban space _e_a_s_e_m_e_n_t and route._[_7_]
The most common road vehicle is the automobile; a _w_h_e_e_l_e_d passenger vehicle
that carries its own _m_o_t_o_r. Other users of roads include _b_u_s_e_s, _t_r_u_c_k_s,
_m_o_t_o_r_c_y_c_l_e_s, _b_i_c_y_c_l_e_s and _p_e_d_e_s_t_r_i_a_n_s. As of 2002, there were 590 million
automobiles worldwide.
Automobiles offer high flexibility and with low capacity, but are deemed with
high energy and area use, and the main source of _n_o_i_s_e and _a_i_r_ _p_o_l_l_u_t_i_o_n in
cities; buses allow for more efficient travel at the cost of reduced
flexibility._[_8_] Road transport by truck is often the initial and final stage of
freight transport.

Water transport is movement by means of a _w_a_t_e_r_c_r_a_f_tâ€”such as a _b_a_r_g_e, _b_o_a_t,
_s_h_i_p or _s_a_i_l_b_o_a_tâ€”over a body of water, such as a _s_e_a, _o_c_e_a_n, _l_a_k_e, _c_a_n_a_l or
_r_i_v_e_r. The need for buoyancy is common to watercraft, making the _h_u_l_l a
dominant aspect of its construction, maintenance and appearance.
In the 19th century the first _s_t_e_a_m_ _s_h_i_p_s were developed, using a _s_t_e_a_m_ _e_n_g_i_n_e
to drive a _p_a_d_d_l_e_ _w_h_e_e_l or _p_r_o_p_e_l_l_e_r to move the ship. The _s_t_e_a_m was produced
in a _b_o_i_l_e_r using wood or _c_o_a_l and fed through a steam _e_x_t_e_r_n_a_l_ _c_o_m_b_u_s_t_i_o_n
_e_n_g_i_n_e. Now most ships have an _i_n_t_e_r_n_a_l_ _c_o_m_b_u_s_t_i_o_n_ _e_n_g_i_n_e using a slightly
refined type of _p_e_t_r_o_l_e_u_m called _b_u_n_k_e_r_ _f_u_e_l. Some ships, such as _s_u_b_m_a_r_i_n_e_s,
use _n_u_c_l_e_a_r_ _p_o_w_e_r to produce the steam. _R_e_c_r_e_a_t_i_o_n_a_l or _e_d_u_c_a_t_i_o_n_a_l craft still
use wind power, while some smaller craft use internal combustion engines to
drive one or more _p_r_o_p_e_l_l_e_r_s, or in the case of jet boats, an inboard water
jet. In shallow draft areas, _h_o_v_e_r_c_r_a_f_t are propelled by large pusher-prop
fans. (See _M_a_r_i_n_e_ _p_r_o_p_u_l_s_i_o_n.)
Although slow, modern sea transport is a highly efficient method of
transporting large quantities of goods. Commercial vessels, nearly 35,000 in
number, carried 7.4 billion tons of cargo in 2007._[_9_] Transport by water is

Bridges, such as _G_o_l_d_e_n_ _G_a_t_e_ _B_r_i_d_g_e, allow roads and railways to cross bodies

Infrastructure is the fixed installations that allow a vehicle to operate. It
consists of a way, a terminal and facilities for parking and maintenance. For
rail, pipeline, road and cable transport, the entire way the vehicle travels
must be built up. Air and water craft are able to avoid this, since the _a_i_r_w_a_y
and _s_e_a_w_a_y do not need to be built up. However, they require fixed
infrastructure at terminals.
Terminals such as airports, ports and stations, are locations where passengers
and freight can be transferred from one vehicle or mode to another. For
passenger transport, terminals are integrating different modes to allow riders
to interchange to take advantage of each mode's advantages. For instance,
_a_i_r_p_o_r_t_ _r_a_i_l_ _l_i_n_k_s connect airports to the city centers and suburbs. The
terminals for automobiles are _p_a_r_k_i_n_g_ _l_o_t_s, while buses and coaches can
operates from simple stops._[_1_3_] For freight, terminals act as _t_r_a_n_s_s_h_i_p_m_e_n_t
points, though some cargo is transported directly from the point of production
to the point of use.
The _f_i_n_a_n_c_i_n_g of infrastructure can either be _p_u_b_l_i_c or _p_r_i_v_a_t_e. Transport is
often a _n_a_t_u_r_a_l_ _m_o_n_o_p_o_l_y and a necessity for the public; roads, and in some
countries railways and airports are funded through _t_a_x_a_t_i_o_n. New infrastructure
projects can involve large spendings, and are often financed through _d_e_b_t. Many
infrastructure owners therefore impose usage fees, such as landing fees at
airports, or _t_o_l_l_ _p_l_a_z_a_s on roads. Independent of this, authorities may impose
_t_a_x_e_s on the purchase or use of vehicles.

A vehicle is any non-living device that is used to move people and goods.
Unlike the infrastructure, the vehicle moves along with the cargo and riders.
Unless being pulled by a cable or muscle-power, the vehicle must provide its
own propulsion; this is most commonly done through a _s_t_e_a_m_ _e_n_g_i_n_e, _c_o_m_b_u_s_t_i_o_n
_e_n_g_i_n_e, _e_l_e_c_t_r_i_c_ _m_o_t_o_r, a _j_e_t_ _e_n_g_i_n_e or a _r_o_c_k_e_t, though other means of
propulsion also exist. Vehicles also need a system of converting the energy
into movement; this is most commonly done through _w_h_e_e_l_s, _p_r_o_p_e_l_l_e_r_s and
_p_r_e_s_s_u_r_e.
Vehicles are most commonly staffed by a _d_r_i_v_e_r. However, some systems, such as
_p_e_o_p_l_e_ _m_o_v_e_r_s and some rapid transits, are fully _a_u_t_o_m_a_t_e_d. For _p_a_s_s_e_n_g_e_r
transport, the vehicle must have a compartment for the passengers. Simple
vehicles, such as automobiles, bicycles or simple aircraft, may have one of the
passengers as a driver.

Private transport is only subject to the owner of the vehicle, who operates the
vehicle themselves. For public transport and freight transport, operations are
done through _p_r_i_v_a_t_e_ _e_n_t_e_r_p_r_i_s_e or by _g_o_v_e_r_n_m_e_n_t_s. The infrastructure and
vehicles may be owned and operated by the same company, or they may be operated
by different entities. Traditionally, many countries have had a _n_a_t_i_o_n_a_l

Public transport is scheduled services on fixed routes, while private is
vehicles that provide ad hoc services at the riders desire. The latter offers
better flexibility, but has lower capacity, and a higher environmental impact.
Travel may be as part of daily _c_o_m_m_u_t_i_n_g, for _b_u_s_i_n_e_s_s, _l_e_i_s_u_r_e or _m_i_g_r_a_t_i_o_n.
Short-haul transport is dominated by the automobile and mass transit. The
latter consists of _b_u_s_e_s in rural and small cities, supplemented with commuter
rail, trams and rapid transit in larger cities. Long-haul transport involves
the use of the automobile, trains, _c_o_a_c_h_e_s and aircraft, the last of which have
become predominantly used for the longest, including intercontinental, travel.

of several modes of transport; since all human transport normally starts and

transport may also involve the intermediate change of vehicle, within or across

located further away from consumption, rapidly increasing the demand for
transport._[_1_7_] While all modes of transport are used for cargo transport, there
is high differentiation between the nature of the cargo transport, in which
mode is chosen._[_1_8_] _L_o_g_i_s_t_i_c_s refers to the entire process of transferring
products from producer to consumer, including storage, transport,

_C_o_n_t_a_i_n_e_r_i_z_a_t_i_o_n, with the standardization of _I_S_O_ _c_o_n_t_a_i_n_e_r_s on all vehicles

huge reduction in _t_r_a_n_s_s_h_i_p_m_e_n_t costs. Traditionally, all cargo had to be
manually loaded and unloaded into the haul of any ship or car; containerization
allows for automated handling and transfer between modes, and the standardized
sizes allow for gains in _e_c_o_n_o_m_y_ _o_f_ _s_c_a_l_e in vehicle operation. This has been

_B_u_l_k_ _t_r_a_n_s_p_o_r_t is common with cargo that can be handled roughly without
deterioration; typical examples are _o_r_e, coal, cereals and _p_e_t_r_o_l_e_u_m. Because
of the uniformity of the product, mechanical handling can allow enormous
quantities to be handled quickly and efficiently. The low value of the cargo
combined with high volume also means that economies of scale become essential
in transport, and gigantic ships and whole trains are commonly used to
transport bulk. Liquid products with sufficient volume may also be transported
by pipeline.
_A_i_r_ _f_r_e_i_g_h_t has become more common for products of high value; while less than
one percent of world transport by volume is by airline, it amounts to forty
percent of the value. Time has become especially important in regards to
principles such as _p_o_s_t_p_o_n_e_m_e_n_t and _j_u_s_t_-_i_n_-_t_i_m_e within the value chain,
resulting in a high willingness to pay for quick delivery of key components or
items of high value-to-weight ratio._[_2_2_] In addition to mail, common items sent
by air include _e_l_e_c_t_r_o_n_i_c_s and _f_a_s_h_i_o_n clothing.

Humans' first means of transport were walking and swimming. The _d_o_m_e_s_t_i_c_a_t_i_o_n
of animals introduces a new way to lay the burden of transport on more powerful
creatures, allowing heavier loads to be hauled, or humans to ride the animals
for higher speed and duration. Inventions such as the wheel and sled helped
make animal transport more efficient through the introduction of vehicles. Also
water transport, including rowed and sailed vessels, dates back to _t_i_m_e
_i_m_m_e_m_o_r_i_a_l, and was the only efficient way to transport large quantities or
over large distances prior to the _I_n_d_u_s_t_r_i_a_l_ _R_e_v_o_l_u_t_i_o_n.
The first forms of _r_o_a_d_ _t_r_a_n_s_p_o_r_t were _h_o_r_s_e_s, _o_x_e_n or even humans carrying
goods over _d_i_r_t tracks that often followed _g_a_m_e _t_r_a_i_l_s. Paved roads were built
by many early civilizations, including _M_e_s_o_p_o_t_a_m_i_a and the _I_n_d_u_s_ _V_a_l_l_e_y
_C_i_v_i_l_i_z_a_t_i_o_n. The _P_e_r_s_i_a_n and _R_o_m_a_n empires built stone-paved roads to allow
armies to travel quickly. Deep roadbeds of crushed stone underneath ensured
that the roads kept dry. The medieval _C_a_l_i_p_h_a_t_e later built _t_a_r_-_p_a_v_e_d roads.
The first watercraft were _c_a_n_o_e_s cut out from _t_r_e_e_ _t_r_u_n_k_s. Early water
transport was accomplished with ships that were either rowed or used the _w_i_n_d
for propulsion, or a combination of the two. The importance of water has led to
most cities, that grew up as sites for trading, being located on rivers or at
sea, often at the intersection of two bodies of water. Until the Industrial
Revolution, transport remained slow and costly, and production and consumption
were located as close to each other as feasible.

The _I_n_d_u_s_t_r_i_a_l_ _R_e_v_o_l_u_t_i_o_n in the 19th century saw a number of inventions
fundamentally change transport. With _t_e_l_e_g_r_a_p_h_y, communication became instant
and independent of transport. The invention of the _s_t_e_a_m_ _e_n_g_i_n_e, closely
followed by its application in rail transport, made land transport independent
of human or animal muscles. Both speed and capacity increased rapidly, allowing
specialization through manufacturing being located independent of natural
resources. The 19th century also saw the development of the _s_t_e_a_m_ _s_h_i_p, that
sped up global transport.
With the development of the _c_o_m_b_u_s_t_i_o_n_ _e_n_g_i_n_e and the automobile at the turn
into the 20th century, road transport became more viable, allowing the
introduction of mechanical private transport. The first highways were
constructed during the 19th century with _m_a_c_a_d_a_m. Later, _t_a_r_m_a_c and _c_o_n_c_r_e_t_e
became the dominant paving material. In 1903, the first controllable _a_i_r_p_l_a_n_e
was invented, and after World War I, it became a fast way to transport people
and express goods over long distances._[_2_3_]
After World War II, the automobile and airlines took higher shares of
transport, reducing rail and water to freight and short-haul passenger._[_2_4_]
Spaceflight was launched in the 1950s, with rapid growth until the 1970s, when
interest dwindled. In the 1950s, the introduction of _c_o_n_t_a_i_n_e_r_i_z_a_t_i_o_n gave
massive efficiency gains in freight transport, permitting _g_l_o_b_a_l_i_z_a_t_i_o_n._[_2_1_]
International air travel became much more accessible in the 1960s, with the
commercialization of the _j_e_t_ _e_n_g_i_n_e. Along with the growth in automobiles and
motorways, this introduced a decline for rail and water transport. After the
introduction of the _S_h_i_n_k_a_n_s_e_n in 1964, high-speed rail in Asia and Europe
started taking passengers on long-haul routes from airlines._[_2_4_]

transportation infrastructure came under government control in the late 19th
and early 20th centuries, culminating in the _n_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_i_z_a_t_i_o_n of inter-city
passenger rail service with the creation of _A_m_t_r_a_k. Recently, however, a
movement to privatize roads and other infrastructure has gained some ground and
adherents._[_2_5_]

Transport is a key necessity for _s_p_e_c_i_a_l_i_z_a_t_i_o_nâ€”allowing production and
consumption of products to occur at different locations. Transport has
throughout history been a spur to expansion; better transport allows more _t_r_a_d_e
and a greater spread of people. _E_c_o_n_o_m_i_c_ _g_r_o_w_t_h has always been dependent on
increasing the capacity and rationality of transport._[_2_6_] But the

Modern society dictates a physical distinction between home and work, forcing
people to transport themselves to places of work or study, as well as to
temporarily relocate for other daily activities. Passenger transport is also
the essence of _t_o_u_r_i_s_m, a major part of _r_e_c_r_e_a_t_i_o_n_a_l transport. Commerce
requires the transport of people to conduct business, either to allow face-to-
face communication for important decisions or to move specialists from their
regular place of work to sites where they are needed.

Because of the negative impacts made, transport often becomes the subject of
controversy related to choice of mode, as well as increased capacity.
Automotive transport can be seen as a _t_r_a_g_e_d_y_ _o_f_ _t_h_e_ _c_o_m_m_o_n_s, where the
flexibility and comfort for the individual deteriorate the natural and urban
environment for all. _D_e_n_s_i_t_y_ _o_f_ _d_e_v_e_l_o_p_m_e_n_t depends on mode of transport, with
public transport allowing for better spacial utilization. Good land use keeps
common activities close to peoples homes and places higher-density development
closer to transport lines and hubs; minimize the need for transport. There are
_e_c_o_n_o_m_i_e_s_ _o_f_ _a_g_g_l_o_m_e_r_a_t_i_o_n. Beyond transportation some land uses are more
efficient when clustered. Transportation facilities consume land, and in
cities, pavement (devoted to streets and parking) can easily exceed 20 percent
of the total land use. An efficient transport system can reduce land waste.
Too much infrastructure and too much smoothing for maximum vehicle throughput
means that in many cities there is too much traffic and manyâ€”if not allâ€”of
the negative impacts that come with it. It is only in recent years that
traditional practices have started to be questioned in many places, and as a
result of new types of analysis which bring in a much broader range of skills
than those traditionally relied onâ€”spanning such areas as environmental
impact analysis, public health, sociologists as well as economists who
increasingly are questioning the viability of the old mobility solutions.
European cities are leading this transition.

carbon emissions of road vehicles considerably have been studied._[_3_0_]_[_3_1_]
Energy use and emissions vary largely between modes, causing _e_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t_a_l_i_s_t_s
to call for a transition from air and road to rail and human-powered transport,

Other environmental impacts of transport systems include _t_r_a_f_f_i_c_ _c_o_n_g_e_s_t_i_o_n and
automobile-oriented _u_r_b_a_n_ _s_p_r_a_w_l, which can consume natural habitat and
