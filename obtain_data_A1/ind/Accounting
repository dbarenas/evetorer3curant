AAccccoouunnttaannccyy, or aaccccoouunnttiinngg, is the production of financial records about an
_o_r_g_a_n_i_z_a_t_i_o_n._[_1_]_[_2_] Accountancy generally produces _f_i_n_a_n_c_i_a_l_ _s_t_a_t_e_m_e_n_t_s that
show in money terms the _e_c_o_n_o_m_i_c_ _r_e_s_o_u_r_c_e_s under the control of management;
selecting information that is relevant and representing it faithfully. The
_p_r_i_n_c_i_p_l_e_s of accountancy are applied to accounting, _b_o_o_k_k_e_e_p_i_n_g, and _a_u_d_i_t_i_n_g.

Many tedious accounting practices have been simplified with the help of
computer software. _E_n_t_e_r_p_r_i_s_e_ _r_e_s_o_u_r_c_e_ _p_l_a_n_n_i_n_g (ERP) software provides a
comprehensive, centralized, integrated source of information that companies can
use to manage all major business processes, from purchasing to manufacturing to
human resources. This software can replace up to 200 individual software
programs that were previously used. Computer integrated manufacturing allows
products to be made and completely untouched by human hands and can increase
production by having less errors in manufacturing process. Computers have
reduced the cost of accumulating, storing, and reporting managerial accounting
information and have made it possible to produce a more detailed account of all
data that is entered into any given system. Computers have changed business to
business interaction through e-commerce. Rather than dealing with multiple
companies to purchase products a business can purchase a product at a less
expensive price and take out the third party and vastly reduces expenses
companies once accrued. Inter-organizational information system enable
suppliers and businesses to be connected at all times. When a company is low on
a product the supplier will be notified and fulfill an order immediately which
eliminates the need for someone to do inventory, fill out the proper documents,
send them out and wait for their products. _[_4_]
Accounting is thousands of years old; the earliest accounting records, which
date back more than 7,000 years, were found in _M_e_s_o_p_o_t_a_m_i_a (_A_s_s_y_r_i_a_n_s). The
people of that time relied on primitive accounting methods to record the growth
of crops and herds. Accounting evolved, improving over the years and advancing
as business advanced._[_5_]
Early accounts served mainly to assist the memory of the _b_u_s_i_n_e_s_s_p_e_r_s_o_n and the
audience for the account was the _p_r_o_p_r_i_e_t_o_r or record keeper alone. Cruder
forms of accounting were inadequate for the problems created by a business
entity involving multiple _i_n_v_e_s_t_o_r_s, so _d_o_u_b_l_e_-_e_n_t_r_y_ _b_o_o_k_k_e_e_p_i_n_g first emerged
in northern Italy in the 14th century, where trading ventures began to require
more _c_a_p_i_t_a_l than a single individual was able to invest. The development of
_j_o_i_n_t_-_s_t_o_c_k_ _c_o_m_p_a_n_i_e_s created wider audiences for accounts, as investors
without firsthand knowledge of their _o_p_e_r_a_t_i_o_n_s relied on accounts to provide
the requisite information._[_6_] This development resulted in a split of
accounting systems for internal (i.e. _m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t_ _a_c_c_o_u_n_t_i_n_g) and external (i.e.
_f_i_n_a_n_c_i_a_l_ _a_c_c_o_u_n_t_i_n_g) purposes, and subsequently also in accounting and
disclosure regulations and a growing need for independent attestation of
external accounts by _a_u_d_i_t_o_r_s._[_7_]
Today, accounting is called "the language of business"_[_8_] because it is the
vehicle for reporting financial information about a business entity to many
different groups of people. Accounting that concentrates on reporting to people
inside the business entity is called _m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t_ _a_c_c_o_u_n_t_i_n_g and is used to
provide information to employees, managers, _o_w_n_e_r_-_m_a_n_a_g_e_r_s and _a_u_d_i_t_o_r_s.
Management accounting is concerned primarily with providing a basis for making
management or operating decisions. Accounting that provides information to
people outside the business entity is called _f_i_n_a_n_c_i_a_l_ _a_c_c_o_u_n_t_i_n_g and provides
information to present and potential shareholders, _c_r_e_d_i_t_o_r_s such as _b_a_n_k_s or
vendors, _f_i_n_a_n_c_i_a_l_ _a_n_a_l_y_s_t_s, _e_c_o_n_o_m_i_s_t_s, and _g_o_v_e_r_n_m_e_n_t_ _a_g_e_n_c_i_e_s. Because these
users have different needs, the presentation of financial accounts is very
structured and subject to many more rules than management accounting. The body
of rules that governs financial accounting in a given jurisdiction is called
_G_e_n_e_r_a_l_l_y_ _A_c_c_e_p_t_e_d_ _A_c_c_o_u_n_t_i_n_g_ _P_r_i_n_c_i_p_l_e_s, or GAAP. Other rules include
_I_n_t_e_r_n_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _F_i_n_a_n_c_i_a_l_ _R_e_p_o_r_t_i_n_g_ _S_t_a_n_d_a_r_d_s, or IFRS,_[_9_] or US GAAP.

The basic _a_c_c_o_u_n_t_i_n_g_ _e_q_u_a_t_i_o_n is _a_s_s_e_t_s = _l_i_a_b_i_l_i_t_i_e_s + _e_q_u_i_t_y. This is the
Statement of Financial Position (It is the new name of Balance Sheet according
to IFRS). The foundation for the balance sheet begins with the income
statement, which is revenues - expenses = net income or net loss. This is
followed by the retained earnings statement, which is beginning retained
earnings + net income + additional capital(capital contribution) - dividends/
drawings = ending retained earnings. This is also used in many businesses.

The word "_A_c_c_o_u_n_t_a_n_t" is derived from the French word Compter, which took its
origin from the _L_a_t_i_n word Computare. The word was formerly written in English
as "Accomptant", but in process of time the word, which was always pronounced
by dropping the "p", became gradually changed both in _p_r_o_n_u_n_c_i_a_t_i_o_n and in
_o_r_t_h_o_g_r_a_p_h_y to its present form_[_1_0_] (see also _c_o_m_p_t_r_o_l_l_e_r).

The Smithsonian Museum now has a systematically engraved ocher plaque, from the
Blombos Cave in South Africa. It is about 76,000 years old, with marks that may
have been used to count or store information. A close-up look shows that the
markings are clearly organized. This suggests, to some researchers, that they
represent information rather than decoration. This could mean accounting is far
older than previously thought._[_1_1_]

remarkable account to the Roman people of the Emperor _A_u_g_u_s_t_u_s' stewardship. It
listed and quantified his public expenditure, which encompassed distributions
to the people, grants of land or money to army veterans, subsidies to the
_a_e_r_a_r_i_u_m (treasury), building of temples, religious offerings, and expenditures
on theatrical shows and _g_l_a_d_i_a_t_o_r_i_a_l games. It was not an account of state
revenue and expenditure, but was designed to demonstrate Augustus' munificence.
The significance of the Res Gestae Divi Augusti from an accounting perspective
lies in the fact that it illustrates that the _e_x_e_c_u_t_i_v_e_ _a_u_t_h_o_r_i_t_y had access to
detailed financial information, covering a period of some forty years, which
was still retrievable after the event. The scope of the accounting information
at the emperor's disposal suggests that its purpose encompassed planning and
decision-making._[_1_4_]
The Roman historians _S_u_e_t_o_n_i_u_s and _C_a_s_s_i_u_s_ _D_i_o record that in 23 BC, _A_u_g_u_s_t_u_s
prepared a rationarium (account) which listed public revenues, the amounts of
cash in the aerarium (treasury), in the provincial fisci (tax officials), and
in the hands of the _p_u_b_l_i_c_a_n_i (public contractors); and that it included the
names of the freedmen and slaves from whom a detailed account could be
obtained. The closeness of this information to the executive authority of the
emperor is attested by _T_a_c_i_t_u_s' statement that it was written out by Augustus
himself._[_1_5_]

over a few days at the _f_o_r_t of _V_i_n_d_o_l_a_n_d_a circa 110 AD shows that the fort
could compute _r_e_v_e_n_u_e_s in cash on a daily basis, perhaps from sales of surplus
supplies or goods manufactured in the camp, items dispensed to slaves such as
cervesa (_b_e_e_r) and clavi caligares (_n_a_i_l_s for boots), as well as commodities
bought by individual soldiers. The basic needs of the fort were met by a
mixture of direct _p_r_o_d_u_c_t_i_o_n, _p_u_r_c_h_a_s_e and _r_e_q_u_i_s_i_t_i_o_n; in one letter, a
request for money to buy 5,000 modii (measures) of braces (a cereal used in
brewing) shows that the fort bought provisions for a considerable number of

documents, mostly letters, but also including a fair number of accounts, which
come from _R_o_m_a_n_ _E_g_y_p_t in 3rd century AD. The bulk of the documents relate to
the running of a large, private _e_s_t_a_t_e_[_1_7_] is named after Heroninos because he
was phrontistes (_K_o_i_n_e_ _G_r_e_e_k: _m_a_n_a_g_e_r) of the estate which had a complex and
standarised system of accounting which was followed by all its local farm
managers._[_1_8_] Each administrator on each sub-division of the estate drew up his
own little accounts, for the day-to-day running of the estate, payment of the
workforce, production of crops, the sale of produce, the use of animals, and
general expenditure on the staff. This information was then summarized as
pieces of papyrus _s_c_r_o_l_l into one big yearly account for each particular sub-
division of the estate. Entries were arranged by sector, with cash expenses and
gains extrapolated from all the different sectors. Accounts of this kind gave
the owner the opportunity to take better _e_c_o_n_o_m_i_c decisions because the
information was purposefully selected and arranged._[_1_9_]

When medieval Europe moved to a _m_o_n_e_t_a_r_y_ _e_c_o_n_o_m_y in the 13th century, _s_e_d_e_n_t_a_r_y
merchants depended on bookkeeping to oversee multiple simultaneous transactions
financed by _b_a_n_k_ _l_o_a_n_s. One important breakthrough took place around that time:
the introduction of double-entry bookkeeping,_[_2_1_] which is defined as any
bookkeeping system in which there was a _d_e_b_i_t_ _a_n_d_ _c_r_e_d_i_t entry for each
transaction, or for which the majority of transactions were intended to be of
this form._[_2_2_] The historical origin of the use of the words 'debit' and
'credit' in accounting goes back to the days of single-entry bookkeeping in
which the chief objective was to keep track of amounts owed by customers
(_d_e_b_t_o_r_s) and amounts owed to _c_r_e_d_i_t_o_r_s. 'Debit,' is _L_a_t_i_n for 'he owes' and
'credit' Latin for 'he trusts'._[_2_3_]
The earliest extant evidence of full double-entry bookkeeping is the Farolfi
ledger of 1299-1300._[_2_1_] Giovanno Farolfi & Company were a firm of _F_l_o_r_e_n_t_i_n_e
merchants whose head office was in _N_√_Æ_m_e_s who also acted as _m_o_n_e_y_l_e_n_d_e_r_s to the
_A_r_c_h_b_i_s_h_o_p_ _o_f_ _A_r_l_e_s, their most important customer._[_2_4_] The oldest discovered
record of a complete double-entry system is the Messari (_I_t_a_l_i_a_n: _T_r_e_a_s_u_r_e_r's)
accounts of the city of _G_e_n_o_a in 1340. The Messari accounts contain debits and
credits journalised in a _b_i_l_a_t_e_r_a_l form, and contain balances carried forward
from the preceding year, and therefore enjoy general recognition as a double-
entry system._[_2_5_]

_L_u_c_a_ _P_a_c_i_o_l_i's "Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et
Proportionalit√ " (early Italian: "Review of _A_r_i_t_h_m_e_t_i_c, _G_e_o_m_e_t_r_y, _R_a_t_i_o and
Proportion") was first printed and published in _V_e_n_i_c_e in 1494. It included a
27-page _t_r_e_a_t_i_s_e on _b_o_o_k_k_e_e_p_i_n_g, "Particularis de Computis et Scripturis"
(Latin: "Details of Calculation and Recording"). It was written primarily for,
and sold mainly to, merchants who used the book as a reference text, as a
source of pleasure from the _m_a_t_h_e_m_a_t_i_c_a_l_ _p_u_z_z_l_e_s it contained, and to aid the
education of their sons. It represents the first known printed treatise on
bookkeeping; and it is widely believed to be the forerunner of modern
bookkeeping practice. In Summa Arithmetica, Pacioli introduced symbols for _p_l_u_s
_a_n_d_ _m_i_n_u_s for the first time in a printed book, symbols that became standard
notation in Italian Renaissance mathematics. Summa Arithmetica was also the
first known book printed in Italy to contain _a_l_g_e_b_r_a._[_2_6_]
Although Luca Pacioli did not invent double-entry bookkeeping,_[_2_7_] his 27-page
_t_r_e_a_t_i_s_e on bookkeeping contained the first known published work on that topic,
and is said to have laid the foundation for double-entry bookkeeping as it is
practiced today._[_2_8_] Even though Pacioli's treatise exhibits almost no
_o_r_i_g_i_n_a_l_i_t_y, it is generally considered as an important work, mainly because of
its wide circulation, it was written in the _v_e_r_n_a_c_u_l_a_r _I_t_a_l_i_a_n_ _l_a_n_g_u_a_g_e, and it
was a printed book._[_2_9_]
According to Pacioli, accounting is an ad hoc ordering system devised by the
merchant. Its regular use provides the merchant with continued information
about his business, and allows him to evaluate how things are going and to act
accordingly. Pacioli recommends the Venetian method of double-entry bookkeeping
above all others. Three major books of account are at the direct basis of this
system: the memoriale (Italian: _m_e_m_o_r_a_n_d_u_m), the giornale (_J_o_u_r_n_a_l), and the
quaderno (_l_e_d_g_e_r). The ledger is considered as the central one and is
accompanied by an alphabetical _i_n_d_e_x._[_3_0_]
Pacioli's treatise gave instructions in how to record barter transactions and
transactions in a variety of currencies ‚Äì both of which were far more common
than they are today. It also enabled merchants to audit their own books and to
ensure that the entries in the accounting records made by their bookkeepers
complied with the method he described. Without such a system, all merchants who
did not maintain their own records were at greater risk of theft by their
employees and agents: it is not by accident that the first and last items
described in his treatise concern maintenance of an accurate _i_n_v_e_n_t_o_r_y._[_3_1_]
The nature of double-entry can be grasped by recognizing that this system of
bookkeeping did not simply record the things merchants traded so that they
could keep track of assets or calculate profits and losses; instead as a system
of writing, double-entry produced effects that exceeded transcription and
calculation. One of its social effects was to proclaim the honesty of _m_e_r_c_h_a_n_t_s
as a group; one of its _e_p_i_s_t_e_m_o_l_o_g_i_c_a_l effects was to make its formal _p_r_e_c_i_s_i_o_n
based on a _r_u_l_e_ _b_o_u_n_d_ _s_y_s_t_e_m of _a_r_i_t_h_m_e_t_i_c seem to guarantee the _a_c_c_u_r_a_c_y of
the details it recorded. Even though the information recorded in the books of
account was not necessarily accurate, the combination of the double entry
system's precision and the _n_o_r_m_a_l_i_z_i_n_g effect that precision tended to create,
produced the impression that books of account were not only precise, but
accurate as well. Instead of gaining prestige from numbers, double entry
bookkeeping helped confer cultural authority on numbers._[_3_2_]

least two accounts.

Scotland is where Chartered Accountants originated. Edinburgh was long
associated with the profession of law, so we often find the designation of
Writer applied to persons designated as an Accountant. Several members of the
Society of Writers to the Signet, the leading Solicitor Society in Scotland,
practiced as accountants. Moreover, until rather recent times, much accountant
work was done in the offices of solicitors. To some extent in Edinburgh, but to
a greater extent in Glasgow, the early designation of accountant was confounded
with that of merchant.
In July 1854 The Institute of Accountants in Glasgow petitioned Queen Victoria
for a Royal Charter. The Petition, signed by 49 Glasgow accountants, set forth:
That the profession of an Accountant has long existed in Scotland as a distinct
profession of great respectability; that originally the number of those
practising it was few but that, for many years back, the number has been
rapidly increasing. The Edinburgh Society of accountants adopted the name
"Chartered Accountant" for members. In 1880 the English Institute also adopted
this designation. _[_3_3_]

In the _I_E_T_F _R_F_C_s the act of accounting is usually defined as the act of
collecting information on resource usage for the purpose of trend analysis,
auditing, billing, or cost allocation.
For example when a user uses a connectivity service paid with a _p_a_y_-_p_e_r_-_v_i_e_w
approach the accounting process is based on a _m_e_t_e_r_i_n_g of the resource usage by
the user (usually time spent with an active connection or the amount of data
transferred using that connection). The accounting is hence the recording of
this connectivity service consumption for subsequent charging of the service
itself.

_A_n_d_e_r_s_e_n, which at the time was one of the five largest accounting firms in the
world. After a series of revelations involving irregular accounting procedures
conducted throughout the 1990s, Enron filed for _C_h_a_p_t_e_r_ _1_1 bankruptcy
protection in December 2001._[_3_6_]
One consequence of these events was the passage of _S_a_r_b_a_n_e_s_‚_Ä_ì_O_x_l_e_y_ _A_c_t in
2002, as a result of the first admissions of fraudulent behavior made by Enron.
The act significantly raises criminal penalties for _s_e_c_u_r_i_t_i_e_s_ _f_r_a_u_d, for
destroying, altering or fabricating records in federal investigations or any
scheme or attempt to defraud shareholders._[_3_7_]

   8. _^^ The quote "accounting is the language of business" is a common phrase
      in 20th century books on accounting. One of the first to use this phrase,
      Thomas Orrin McGrath (1921) in Mine accounting and cost principles,
      stated:
      As accounting is the language of business, there is great need of
      standardization in the use of all accounting terms and a clear definition
      as to the meaning of each term in order to do away with the present
      ambiguity in the statements of business and to fill the lack of uniform
      business data. (p.5)
