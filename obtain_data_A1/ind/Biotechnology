BBiiootteecchhnnoollooggyy is the use of living systems and organisms to develop or make
useful products, or "any technological application that uses biological
systems, living organisms or derivatives thereof, to make or modify products or
processes for specific use" (UN Convention on Biological Diversity)._[_1_]
Depending on the tools and applications, it often overlaps with the (related)

For thousands of years, humankind has used biotechnology in agriculture, food
production and medicine._[_2_] The term itself is largely believed to have been
coined in 1919 by Hungarian engineer _K_a_r_l_ _E_r_e_k_y. In the late 20th and early
21st century, biotechnology has expanded to include new and diverse sciences
such as _g_e_n_o_m_i_c_s, _r_e_c_o_m_b_i_n_a_n_t_ _g_e_n_e technologies, applied _i_m_m_u_n_o_l_o_g_y, and

The concept of 'biotech' or 'biotechnology' encompasses a wide range of
procedures (and history) for modifying living organisms according to human
purposes â€” going back to domestication of animals, cultivation of plants, and
"improvements" to these through breeding programs that employ _a_r_t_i_f_i_c_i_a_l
_s_e_l_e_c_t_i_o_n and _h_y_b_r_i_d_i_z_a_t_i_o_n. Modern usage also includes _g_e_n_e_t_i_c_ _e_n_g_i_n_e_e_r_i_n_g as
well as _c_e_l_l and _t_i_s_s_u_e_ _c_u_l_t_u_r_e technologies. Biotechnology is defined by the
American Chemical Society as the application of biological organisms, systems,
or processes by various industries to learning about the science of life and
the improvement of the value of materials and organisms such as
pharmaceuticals, crops, and livestock._[_4_] In other words, biotechnology can be
defined as the mere application of technical advances in life science to
develop commercial products. Biotechnology also writes on the pure biological
sciences (_g_e_n_e_t_i_c_s, _m_i_c_r_o_b_i_o_l_o_g_y, _a_n_i_m_a_l_ _c_e_l_l_ _c_u_l_t_u_r_e, _m_o_l_e_c_u_l_a_r_ _b_i_o_l_o_g_y,

dependent on knowledge and methods from outside the sphere of biology
including:
    * _c_h_e_m_i_c_a_l_ _e_n_g_i_n_e_e_r_i_n_g,

    * _b_i_o_i_n_f_o_r_m_a_t_i_c_s, a new brand of _i_n_f_o_r_m_a_t_i_o_n_ _t_e_c_h_n_o_l_o_g_y, and
    * _b_i_o_r_o_b_o_t_i_c_s.
Conversely, modern biological sciences (including even concepts such as
_m_o_l_e_c_u_l_a_r_ _e_c_o_l_o_g_y) are intimately entwined and heavily dependent on the methods
developed through biotechnology and what is commonly thought of as the _l_i_f_e
_s_c_i_e_n_c_e_s industry. Biotechnology is the _r_e_s_e_a_r_c_h_ _a_n_d_ _d_e_v_e_l_o_p_m_e_n_t in the
_l_a_b_o_r_a_t_o_r_y using _b_i_o_i_n_f_o_r_m_a_t_i_c_s for exploration, extraction, exploitation and
production from any _l_i_v_i_n_g_ _o_r_g_a_n_i_s_m_s and any source of _b_i_o_m_a_s_s by means of
_b_i_o_c_h_e_m_i_c_a_l_ _e_n_g_i_n_e_e_r_i_n_g where high value-added products could be planned
(reproduced by _b_i_o_s_y_n_t_h_e_s_i_s, for example), forecasted, formulated, developed,
manufactured and marketed for the purpose of sustainable operations (for the
return from bottomless initial investment on R & D) and gaining durable patents
rights (for exclusives rights for sales, and prior to this to receive national
and international approval from the results on animal experiment and human
experiment, especially on the _p_h_a_r_m_a_c_e_u_t_i_c_a_l branch of biotechnology to prevent
any undetected side-effects or safety concerns by using the products)._[_5_]_[_6_]_[_7_]
By contrast, _b_i_o_e_n_g_i_n_e_e_r_i_n_g is generally thought of as a related field with its
emphasis more on higher systems approaches (not necessarily altering or using
biological materials directly) for interfacing with and utilizing living
things. Bioengineering is the application of the principles of engineering and
natural sciences to tissues, cells and molecules. This can be considered as the
use knowledge from working with and manipulating biology to achieve a result
that can improve functions in plants and animals._[_8_] Relatedly, _b_i_o_m_e_d_i_c_a_l

_B_r_e_w_i_n_g was an early application of biotechnology
Main article: _H_i_s_t_o_r_y_ _o_f_ _b_i_o_t_e_c_h_n_o_l_o_g_y
Although not normally what first comes to mind, many forms of human-derived
_a_g_r_i_c_u_l_t_u_r_e clearly fit the broad definition of "'using a biotechnological
system to make products". Indeed, the cultivation of plants may be viewed as
the earliest biotechnological enterprise.
_A_g_r_i_c_u_l_t_u_r_e has been theorized to have become the dominant way of producing
food since the _N_e_o_l_i_t_h_i_c_ _R_e_v_o_l_u_t_i_o_n. Through early biotechnology, the earliest
farmers selected and bred the best suited crops, having the highest yields, to
produce enough food to support a growing population. As crops and fields became
increasingly large and difficult to maintain, it was discovered that specific
organisms and their by-products could effectively _f_e_r_t_i_l_i_z_e, _r_e_s_t_o_r_e_ _n_i_t_r_o_g_e_n,
and _c_o_n_t_r_o_l_ _p_e_s_t_s. Throughout the history of agriculture, farmers have
inadvertently altered the genetics of their crops through introducing them to
new environments and _b_r_e_e_d_i_n_g them with other plants â€” one of the first forms
of biotechnology.
These processes also were included in early _f_e_r_m_e_n_t_a_t_i_o_n of _b_e_e_r._[_9_] These
processes were introduced in early _M_e_s_o_p_o_t_a_m_i_a, _E_g_y_p_t, _C_h_i_n_a and _I_n_d_i_a, and
still use the same basic biological methods. In _b_r_e_w_i_n_g, malted grains
(containing _e_n_z_y_m_e_s) convert starch from grains into sugar and then adding
specific _y_e_a_s_t_s to produce beer. In this process, _c_a_r_b_o_h_y_d_r_a_t_e_s in the grains
were broken down into alcohols such as ethanol. Later other cultures produced
the process of _l_a_c_t_i_c_ _a_c_i_d_ _f_e_r_m_e_n_t_a_t_i_o_n which allowed the fermentation and
preservation of other forms of food, such as _s_o_y_ _s_a_u_c_e. Fermentation was also
used in this time period to produce _l_e_a_v_e_n_e_d_ _b_r_e_a_d. Although the process of
fermentation was not fully understood until _L_o_u_i_s_ _P_a_s_t_e_u_r's work in 1857, it is
still the first use of biotechnology to convert a food source into another
form.
For thousands of years, humans have used selective breeding to improve
production of crops and livestock to use them for food. In selective breeding,
organisms with desirable characteristics are mated to produce offspring with
the same characteristics. For example, this technique was used with corn to
produce the largest and sweetest crops._[_1_0_]
In the early twentieth century scientists gained a greater understanding of
_m_i_c_r_o_b_i_o_l_o_g_y and explored ways of manufacturing specific products. In 1917,
_C_h_a_i_m_ _W_e_i_z_m_a_n_n first used a pure microbiological culture in an industrial
process, that of manufacturing _c_o_r_n_ _s_t_a_r_c_h using _C_l_o_s_t_r_i_d_i_u_m_ _a_c_e_t_o_b_u_t_y_l_i_c_u_m, to
produce _a_c_e_t_o_n_e, which the _U_n_i_t_e_d_ _K_i_n_g_d_o_m desperately needed to manufacture
_e_x_p_l_o_s_i_v_e_s during _W_o_r_l_d_ _W_a_r_ _I._[_1_1_]
Biotechnology has also led to the development of antibiotics. In 1928,
_A_l_e_x_a_n_d_e_r_ _F_l_e_m_i_n_g discovered the mold _P_e_n_i_c_i_l_l_i_u_m. His work led to the
purification of the antibiotic compound formed by the mold by Howard Florey,
Ernst Boris Chain and Norman Heatley - to form what we today know as
_p_e_n_i_c_i_l_l_i_n. In 1940, penicillin became available for medicinal use to treat
bacterial infections in humans._[_1_0_]
The field of modern biotechnology is generally thought of as having been born
in 1971 when Paul Berg's (Stanford) experiments in gene splicing had early
success. Herbert W. Boyer (Univ. Calif. at San Francisco) and Stanley N. Cohen
(Stanford) significantly advanced the new technology in 1972 by transferring
genetic material into a bacterium, such that the imported material would be
reproduced. The commercial viability of a biotechnology industry was
significantly expanded on June 16, 1980, when the _U_n_i_t_e_d_ _S_t_a_t_e_s_ _S_u_p_r_e_m_e_ _C_o_u_r_t
ruled that a _g_e_n_e_t_i_c_a_l_l_y_ _m_o_d_i_f_i_e_d _m_i_c_r_o_o_r_g_a_n_i_s_m could be _p_a_t_e_n_t_e_d in the case
of _D_i_a_m_o_n_d_ _v_._ _C_h_a_k_r_a_b_a_r_t_y._[_1_2_] Indian-born Ananda Chakrabarty, working for
_G_e_n_e_r_a_l_ _E_l_e_c_t_r_i_c, had modified a bacterium (of the _P_s_e_u_d_o_m_o_n_a_s genus) capable
of breaking down crude oil, which he proposed to use in treating oil spills.
(Chakrabarty's work did not involve gene manipulation but rather the transfer
of entire organelles between strains of the Pseudomonas bacterium.
Revenue in the industry is expected to grow by 12.9% in 2008. Another factor
influencing the biotechnology sector's success is improved intellectual
property rights legislationâ€”and enforcementâ€”worldwide, as well as
strengthened demand for medical and pharmaceutical products to cope with an
ageing, and ailing, U.S. population._[_1_3_]
Rising demand for biofuels is expected to be good news for the biotechnology
sector, with the _D_e_p_a_r_t_m_e_n_t_ _o_f_ _E_n_e_r_g_y estimating _e_t_h_a_n_o_l usage could reduce
U.S. petroleum-derived fuel consumption by up to 30% by 2030. The biotechnology
sector has allowed the U.S. farming industry to rapidly increase its supply of
corn and soybeansâ€”the main inputs into biofuelsâ€”by developing genetically
modified seeds which are resistant to pests and drought. By boosting farm

Biotechnology has applications in four major industrial areas, including health
care (medical), crop production and agriculture, non food (industrial) uses of
crops and other products (e.g. _b_i_o_d_e_g_r_a_d_a_b_l_e_ _p_l_a_s_t_i_c_s, _v_e_g_e_t_a_b_l_e_ _o_i_l,
_b_i_o_f_u_e_l_s), and environmental uses.
For example, one application of biotechnology is the directed use of _o_r_g_a_n_i_s_m_s
for the manufacture of organic products (examples include _b_e_e_r and _m_i_l_k
products). Another example is using naturally present _b_a_c_t_e_r_i_a by the mining
industry in _b_i_o_l_e_a_c_h_i_n_g. Biotechnology is also used to recycle, treat waste,
cleanup sites contaminated by industrial activities (_b_i_o_r_e_m_e_d_i_a_t_i_o_n), and also
to produce _b_i_o_l_o_g_i_c_a_l_ _w_e_a_p_o_n_s.
A series of derived terms have been coined to identify several branches of
biotechnology; for example:

      problems using computational techniques, and makes the rapid organization
      and analysis of biological data possible. The field may also be referred
      to as computational biology, and can be defined as, "conceptualizing
      biology in terms of molecules and then applying informatics techniques to
      understand and organize the information associated with these molecules,
      on a large scale."_[_1_5_] Bioinformatics plays a key role in various areas,
      such as _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _g_e_n_o_m_i_c_s, _s_t_r_u_c_t_u_r_a_l_ _g_e_n_o_m_i_c_s, and _p_r_o_t_e_o_m_i_c_s, and
      forms a key component in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sector.

      An example would be the selection and domestication of plants via
      _m_i_c_r_o_p_r_o_p_a_g_a_t_i_o_n. Another example is the designing of _t_r_a_n_s_g_e_n_i_c_ _p_l_a_n_t_s
      to grow under specific environments in the presence (or absence) of
      chemicals. One hope is that green biotechnology might produce more
      environmentally friendly solutions than traditional _i_n_d_u_s_t_r_i_a_l
      _a_g_r_i_c_u_l_t_u_r_e. An example of this is the engineering of a plant to express
      a _p_e_s_t_i_c_i_d_e, thereby ending the need of external application of
      pesticides. An example of this would be _B_t_ _c_o_r_n. Whether or not green
      biotechnology products such as this are ultimately more environmentally
      friendly is a topic of considerable debate.

Pharmacogenomics is the study of how the genetic inheritance of an individual
affects his/her body's response to drugs. It is a _c_o_m_p_o_u_n_d derived from the
root of the word "pharmacology" plus the word "genomics". It is hence the study
of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics. The vision of
pharmacogenomics is to be able to design and produce drugs that are adapted to
each person's genetic makeup._[_1_6_]
Pharmacogenomics results in the following benefits:_[_1_6_]
   1. Development of tailor-made medicines. Using pharmacogenomics,
      pharmaceutical companies can create drugs based on the _p_r_o_t_e_i_n_s, enzymes
      and _R_N_A molecules that are associated with specific genes and diseases.
      These tailor-made drugs promise not only to maximize therapeutic effects
      but also to decrease damage to nearby healthy cells.
   2. More accurate methods of determining appropriate drug dosages. Knowing a
      patient's genetics will enable doctors to determine how well his/ her
      body can process and metabolize a medicine. This will maximize the value
      of the medicine and decrease the likelihood of overdose.
   3. Improvements in the drug discovery and approval process. The discovery of
      potential therapies will be made easier using genome targets. Genes have
      been associated with numerous diseases and disorders. With modern
      biotechnology, these genes can be used as targets for the development of
      effective new therapies, which could significantly shorten the drug
      discovery process.
   4. Better vaccines. Safer vaccines can be designed and produced by organisms
      transformed by means of genetic engineering. These vaccines will elicit
      the immune response without the attendant risks of infection. They will
      be inexpensive, stable, easy to store, and capable of being engineered to
      carry several strains of pathogen at once.

Most traditional pharmaceutical drugs are relatively small molecules that bind
to particular molecular targets and either activate or deactivate biological
processes. Small molecules are typically manufactured through traditional
organic synthesis, and many can be taken orally. In contrast,
_B_i_o_p_h_a_r_m_a_c_e_u_t_i_c_a_l_s are large biological molecules such as _p_r_o_t_e_i_n_s that are
developed to address targets that cannot easily be addressed by small
molecules. Some examples of biopharmaceutical drugs include Infliximab, a
monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, Etanercept, a
fusion protein used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, and Rituximab, a
chimeric monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of cancer. Due to their
larger size, and corresponding difficulty with surviving the stomach, colon and
liver, biopharmaceuticals are typically injected.
Modern biotechnology is often associated with the use of genetically altered
_m_i_c_r_o_o_r_g_a_n_i_s_m_s such as _E_._ _c_o_l_i or _y_e_a_s_t for the production of substances like
synthetic _i_n_s_u_l_i_n or _a_n_t_i_b_i_o_t_i_c_s. It can also refer to _t_r_a_n_s_g_e_n_i_c_ _a_n_i_m_a_l_s or
_t_r_a_n_s_g_e_n_i_c_ _p_l_a_n_t_s, such as _B_t_ _c_o_r_n. Genetically altered mammalian cells, such
as _C_h_i_n_e_s_e_ _H_a_m_s_t_e_r_ _O_v_a_r_y_ _c_e_l_l_s (CHO), are also used to manufacture certain
pharmaceuticals. Another promising new biotechnology application is the
development of _p_l_a_n_t_-_m_a_d_e_ _p_h_a_r_m_a_c_e_u_t_i_c_a_l_s.
Biotechnology is also commonly associated with landmark breakthroughs in new
medical therapies to treat _h_e_p_a_t_i_t_i_s_ _B, _h_e_p_a_t_i_t_i_s_ _C, _c_a_n_c_e_r_s, _a_r_t_h_r_i_t_i_s,
_h_a_e_m_o_p_h_i_l_i_a, _b_o_n_e_ _f_r_a_c_t_u_r_e_s, _m_u_l_t_i_p_l_e_ _s_c_l_e_r_o_s_i_s, and _c_a_r_d_i_o_v_a_s_c_u_l_a_r disorders.
The biotechnology industry has also been instrumental in developing molecular
diagnostic devices that can be used to define the target patient population for
a given biopharmaceutical. _H_e_r_c_e_p_t_i_n, for example, was the first drug approved
for use with a matching diagnostic test and is used to treat breast cancer in
women whose cancer cells express the protein _H_E_R_2.
Modern biotechnology can be used to manufacture existing medicines relatively
easily and cheaply. The first genetically engineered products were medicines
designed to treat human diseases. To cite one example, in 1978 _G_e_n_e_n_t_e_c_h
developed synthetic humanized _i_n_s_u_l_i_n by joining its gene with a _p_l_a_s_m_i_d vector
inserted into the bacterium _E_s_c_h_e_r_i_c_h_i_a_ _c_o_l_i. Insulin, widely used for the
treatment of diabetes, was previously extracted from the pancreas of _a_b_a_t_t_o_i_r
animals (cattle and/or pigs). The resulting genetically engineered bacterium
enabled the production of vast quantities of synthetic human insulin at
relatively low cost._[_1_7_] According to a 2003 study undertaken by the
International Diabetes Federation (IDF) on the access to and availability of
insulin in its member countries, synthetic 'human' insulin is considerably more
expensive in most countries where both synthetic 'human' and animal insulin are
commercially available: e.g. within European countries the average price of
synthetic 'human' insulin was twice as high as the price of pork insulin._[_1_8_]
Yet in its position statement, the IDF writes that "there is no overwhelming
evidence to prefer one species of insulin over another" and "[modern, highly
purified] animal insulins remain a perfectly acceptable alternative._[_1_9_]
Modern biotechnology has evolved, making it possible to produce more easily and
relatively cheaply _h_u_m_a_n_ _g_r_o_w_t_h_ _h_o_r_m_o_n_e, _c_l_o_t_t_i_n_g_ _f_a_c_t_o_r_s for _h_e_m_o_p_h_i_l_i_a_c_s,

on about 500 molecular targets. Genomic knowledge of the genes involved in
diseases, disease pathways, and drug-response sites are expected to lead to the
discovery of thousands more new targets._[_2_0_]

_G_e_n_e_t_i_c_ _t_e_s_t_i_n_g involves the direct examination of the _D_N_A molecule itself. A
scientist scans a patient's DNA sample for mutated sequences.
There are two major types of gene tests. In the first type, a researcher may
design short pieces of DNA ("probes") whose sequences are complementary to the
mutated sequences. These probes will seek their complement among the base pairs
of an individual's genome. If the mutated sequence is present in the patient's
genome, the probe will bind to it and flag the mutation. In the second type, a
researcher may conduct the gene test by comparing the sequence of DNA bases in
a patient's gene to disease in healthy individuals or their progeny.
Genetic testing is now used for:
    * Carrier screening, or the identification of unaffected individuals who
      carry one copy of a gene for a disease that requires two copies for the
      disease to manifest;
    * Confirmational diagnosis of symptomatic individuals;
    * Determining sex;
    * Forensic/identity testing;
    * Newborn screening;
    * Prenatal diagnostic screening;
    * Presymptomatic testing for estimating the risk of developing adult-onset
      cancers;
    * Presymptomatic testing for predicting adult-onset disorders.
Some genetic tests are already available, although most of them are used in
developed countries. The tests currently available can detect mutations
associated with rare genetic disorders like _c_y_s_t_i_c_ _f_i_b_r_o_s_i_s, _s_i_c_k_l_e_ _c_e_l_l

mutation for a handful of more complex conditions such as breast, ovarian, and
colon cancers. However, gene tests may not detect every mutation associated
with a particular condition because many are as yet undiscovered.

   1. Reproductive issues. These include the use of genetic information in
      reproductive decision-making and the possibility of genetically altering
      reproductive cells that may be passed on to future generations. For
      example, germline therapy changes the genetic make-up of an individual's
      descendants. Thus, any error in technology or judgment may have far-
      reaching consequences (though the same can also happen through natural
      reproduction). Ethical issues like _d_e_s_i_g_n_e_d_ _b_a_b_i_e_s and human cloning have
      also given rise to controversies between and among scientists and

      _r_e_d_u_c_t_i_o_ _a_d_ _h_i_t_l_e_r_u_m).
   2. Clinical issues. These centers on the capabilities and limitations of
      doctors and other health-service providers, people identified with
      genetic conditions, and the general public in dealing with genetic
      information.
   3. Effects on social institutions. Genetic tests reveal information about
      individuals and their families. Thus, test results can affect the
      dynamics within social institutions, particularly the family.
   4. Conceptual and philosophical implications regarding human responsibility,
      free will vis-Ã -vis genetic determinism, and the concepts of health and
      disease.

Gene therapy using an _A_d_e_n_o_v_i_r_u_s vector. A new gene is inserted into an
adenovirus vector, which is used to introduce the modified _D_N_A into a human
cell. If the treatment is successful, the new gene will make a functional
_p_r_o_t_e_i_n.
Gene therapy may be used for treating, or even curing, genetic and acquired
diseases like cancer and AIDS by using normal genes to supplement or replace
defective genes or to bolster a normal function such as immunity. It can be
used to target _s_o_m_a_t_i_c_ _c_e_l_l_s (i.e., those of the body) or _g_a_m_e_t_e (i.e., egg and
sperm) cells. In somatic gene therapy, the genome of the recipient is changed,
but this change is not passed along to the next generation. In contrast, in
germline gene therapy, the egg and sperm cells of the parents are changed for
the purpose of passing on the changes to their offspring.
There are basically two ways of implementing a gene therapy treatment:
   1. Ex vivo, which means "outside the body" â€“ Cells from the patient's
      blood or _b_o_n_e_ _m_a_r_r_o_w are removed and grown in the laboratory. They are
      then exposed to a virus carrying the desired gene. The virus enters the
      cells, and the desired gene becomes part of the DNA of the cells. The
      cells are allowed to grow in the laboratory before being returned to the
      patient by injection into a vein.
   2. In vivo, which means "inside the body" â€“ No cells are removed from the
      patient's body. Instead, vectors are used to deliver the desired gene to
      cells in the patient's body.
As of June 2001, more than 500 clinical gene-therapy trials involving about
3,500 patients have been identified worldwide. Around 78% of these are in the
United States, with Europe having 18%. These trials focus on various types of
cancer, although other multigenic diseases are being studied as well. Recently,

Gene therapy faces many obstacles before it can become a practical approach for
treating disease._[_2_1_] At least four of these obstacles are as follows:
   1. Gene delivery tools. Genes are inserted into the body using gene carriers
      called vectors. The most common vectors now are viruses, which have
      evolved a way of encapsulating and delivering their genes to human cells
      in a pathogenic manner. Scientists manipulate the genome of the virus by
      removing the disease-causing genes and inserting the therapeutic genes.
      However, while viruses are effective, they can introduce problems like
      toxicity, immune and inflammatory responses, and gene control and
      targeting issues. In addition, in order for gene therapy to provide
      permanent therapeutic effects, the introduced gene needs to be integrated
      within the host cell's genome. Some viral vectors effect this in a random
      fashion, which can introduce other problems such as disruption of an
      endogenous host gene.
   2. High costs. Since gene therapy is relatively new and at an experimental
      stage, it is an expensive treatment to undertake. This explains why
      current studies are focused on illnesses commonly found in developed
      countries, where more people can afford to pay for treatment. It may take
      decades before developing countries can take advantage of this
      technology.
   3. Limited knowledge of the functions of genes. Scientists currently know
      the functions of only a few genes. Hence, gene therapy can address only
      some genes that cause a particular disease. Worse, it is not known
      exactly whether genes have more than one function, which creates
      uncertainty as to whether replacing such genes is indeed desirable.
   4. Multigene disorders and effect of environment. Most genetic disorders
      involve more than one gene. Moreover, most diseases involve the
      interaction of several genes and the environment. For example, many
      people with cancer not only inherit the disease gene for the disorder,
      but may have also failed to inherit specific tumor suppressor genes.
      Diet, exercise, smoking and other environmental factors may have also
      contributed to their disease.

The HGP was originally planned to last 15 years. However, rapid technological

Cloning involves the removal of the nucleus from one cell and its placement in
an unfertilized egg cell whose nucleus has either been deactivated or removed.
There are two types of cloning:
   1. Reproductive cloning. After a few divisions, the egg cell is placed into
      a uterus where it is allowed to develop into a fetus that is genetically
      identical to the donor of the original nucleus.
   2. Therapeutic cloning._[_2_3_] The egg is placed into a _P_e_t_r_i_ _d_i_s_h where it
      develops into embryonic stem cells, which have shown potentials for
      treating several ailments._[_2_4_]
In February 1997, cloning became the focus of media attention when Ian Wilmut
and his colleagues at the Roslin Institute announced the successful cloning of
a sheep, named Dolly, from the mammary glands of an adult female. The cloning
of Dolly made it apparent to many that the techniques used to produce her could
someday be used to clone human beings._[_2_5_] This stirred a lot of controversy
because of its ethical implications.

they are also the most difficult ones. Current genetic engineering techniques
work best for effects that are controlled by a single gene. Many of the genetic

a large number of genes, each of which has a minimal effect on the overall

Crops containing genes that will enable them to withstand biotic and abiotic
stresses may be developed. For example, _d_r_o_u_g_h_t and excessively salty soil are
two important _l_i_m_i_t_i_n_g_ _f_a_c_t_o_r_s in crop productivity. Biotechnologists work to
find genes that enable some plants to cope with these extreme conditions and
eventually to transfer these genes to the more productive crops. One of the
latest developments is the identification of a plant gene, At-DBF2, from
_A_r_a_b_i_d_o_p_s_i_s_ _t_h_a_l_i_a_n_a. Arabidopsis thaliana is a tiny weed often used for plant
research because it is very easy to grow. Its genetic code, approximately 115
Mb of the 125 Mb genome,_[_2_8_] which has been sequenced and interpreted and which
can be manipulated in many ways. The At-DBF2 gene shows tolerance to salt,
drought and the heat and cold in plants. When this gene was inserted into
_t_o_m_a_t_o and _t_o_b_a_c_c_o cells (see _R_N_A_ _i_n_t_e_r_f_e_r_e_n_c_e), the cells withstood these
conditions far better than ordinary cells. If these preliminary results prove
successful in larger trials, then At-DBF2 genes can help in engineering crops
that can better withstand harsh environments._[_2_9_] Researchers have also created
transgenic rice plants that resist _r_i_c_e_ _y_e_l_l_o_w_ _m_o_t_t_l_e_ _v_i_r_u_s (RYMV). In Africa,
this virus destroys a majority of the rice crops and makes the surviving plants
more susceptible to fungal infections._[_3_0_] While all of these technological
advances have the probability for commercial use, they need to be researched
more publicly so they can be proven as a stable source of production.

Modern biotechnology can be used to slow down the process of spoilage. Modified
fruit can ripen longer on the plant and then be transported to the consumer
with less risk of spoilage, and a still-reasonable shelf life. This alters the
taste, texture and appearance of the fruit. Reduction in spoilage could expand
the market for farmers in developing countries. However, there is sometimes a
lack of understanding by researchers in developed countries about the actual
needs of prospective beneficiaries in developing countries. For example,
engineering soybeans to resist spoilage makes them less suitable for producing
_t_e_m_p_e_h, a significant source of protein that depends on fermentation. Modified
soybeans produce tempeh which chefs find lumpy, less palatable, and less
convenient.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] This is much the same as certain varietals of

Most of the current commercial applications of modern biotechnology in
agriculture are on reducing the dependence of farmers on _a_g_r_o_c_h_e_m_i_c_a_l_s. For
example, _B_a_c_i_l_l_u_s_ _t_h_u_r_i_n_g_i_e_n_s_i_s (Bt) is a soil bacterium that produces a
protein with insecticidal qualities. Traditionally, a fermentation process has
been used to produce an insecticidal spray from these bacteria. In this form,
the _B_t_ _t_o_x_i_n occurs as an inactive _p_r_o_t_o_x_i_n, which requires digestion by an
insect to be effective. There are several Bt toxins and each one is specific to
certain target insects. Crop plants have now been engineered to contain and
express the genes for Bt toxin, which they produce in its active form. When a
susceptible insect ingests the transgenic crop cultivar expressing the Bt
protein, it stops feeding and soon thereafter dies as a result of the Bt toxin
binding to its gut wall. Bt corn is now commercially available in a number of
countries to control _c_o_r_n_ _b_o_r_e_r (a lepidopteran insect), which is otherwise
controlled by spraying (a more difficult process).
Crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to broad-
spectrum _h_e_r_b_i_c_i_d_e. The lack of herbicides with broad-spectrum activity and no
crop injury was a consistent limitation in crop _w_e_e_d_ _m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t. Multiple
applications of numerous herbicides were routinely used to control a wide range
of weed species detrimental to agronomic crops. Weed management tended to rely
on preemergenceâ€”that is, herbicide applications were sprayed in response to
expected weed infestations rather than in response to actual weeds present.
Mechanical cultivation and hand weeding were often necessary to control weeds
not controlled by herbicide applications. The introduction of herbicide-
tolerant crops has the potential of reducing the number of herbicide active
ingredients used for weed management, reducing the number of herbicide
applications made during a season, and increasing yield due to improved weed
management and less crop injury. Transgenic crops that express tolerance to
_g_l_y_p_h_o_s_a_t_e, _g_l_u_f_o_s_i_n_a_t_e and _b_r_o_m_o_x_y_n_i_l have been developed. These herbicides
can now be sprayed on transgenic crops without inflicting damage on the crops
while killing nearby weeds._[_3_6_]
From 1996 to 2001, herbicide tolerance was the most dominant trait introduced
to commercially available transgenic crops, followed by insect resistance. In
2001, herbicide tolerance deployed in _s_o_y_b_e_a_n, _c_o_r_n and _c_o_t_t_o_n accounted for
77% of the 626,000 square kilometres planted to transgenic crops; Bt crops
accounted for 15%; and "stacked genes" for herbicide tolerance and insect
resistance used in both cotton and corn accounted for 8%._[_3_7_]

modified to produce fatty acids for _d_e_t_e_r_g_e_n_t_s, substitute _f_u_e_l_s and
_p_e_t_r_o_c_h_e_m_i_c_a_l_s. _P_o_t_a_t_o_e_s, _t_o_m_a_t_o_e_s, _r_i_c_e, _t_o_b_a_c_c_o, _l_e_t_t_u_c_e, _s_a_f_f_l_o_w_e_r_s, and
other plants have been genetically engineered to produce _i_n_s_u_l_i_n and certain
_v_a_c_c_i_n_e_s. If future clinical trials prove successful, the advantages of edible
_v_a_c_c_i_n_e_s would be enormous, especially for developing countries. The transgenic
plants may be grown locally and cheaply. Homegrown vaccines would also avoid
logistical and economic problems posed by having to transport traditional
preparations over long distances and by having to keep them cold in transit.
And since they would be edible, they would not need syringes, which are not
only an additional expense in the traditional vaccine preparations but also a
source of infections if contaminated._[_3_8_] In the case of insulin grown in
transgenic plants, it is well-established that the gastrointestinal system
breaks the protein down therefore this could not currently be administered as

regulation (e.g., _U_._S_._ _F_o_o_d_ _a_n_d_ _D_r_u_g_ _A_d_m_i_n_i_s_t_r_a_t_i_o_n regulation in the U.S.) are
very important issues for biotech enterprises, bioengineers are often required
to have knowledge related to these issues.
The increasing number of biotech enterprises is likely to create a need for
bioengineers in the years to come. Many universities throughout the world are
now providing programs in bioengineering and biotechnology (as independent
programs or specialty programs within more established engineering fields).

Biotechnology is being used to engineer and adapt _o_r_g_a_n_i_s_m_s, especially
_m_i_c_r_o_o_r_g_a_n_i_s_m_s, in an effort to find sustainable ways to clean up contaminated
environments. The elimination of a wide range of pollutants and wastes from the
_e_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t is an absolute requirement to promote a sustainable development of
our society with low environmental impact. Biological processes play a major
role in the removal of _c_o_n_t_a_m_i_n_a_n_t_s. Biotechnology takes advantage of the
_c_a_t_a_b_o_l_i_c versatility of microorganisms and their ability to degrade/convert
such compounds. New methodological breakthroughs in _s_e_q_u_e_n_c_i_n_g, _g_e_n_o_m_i_c_s,
_p_r_o_t_e_o_m_i_c_s, _b_i_o_i_n_f_o_r_m_a_t_i_c_s and imaging are producing vast amounts of
information. In the field of Environmental Microbiology, _g_e_n_o_m_e-based global
studies open a new era providing unprecedented in silico views of metabolic and
regulatory networks. Environmental Microbiology also offers clues to the
evolution of _d_e_g_r_a_d_a_t_i_o_n pathways and to the molecular adaptation strategies to
changing environmental conditions. Functional genomic and metagenomic
approaches are increasing understanding of the relative importance of different
pathways and regulatory networks to _c_a_r_b_o_n_ _f_l_u_x in particular environments and
for particular compounds. They will certainly accelerate the development of
_b_i_o_r_e_m_e_d_i_a_t_i_o_n technologies and _b_i_o_t_r_a_n_s_f_o_r_m_a_t_i_o_n processes._[_4_5_]
Marine environments are especially vulnerable since oil spills of coastal
regions and the open sea are poorly containable and mitigation is difficult. In
addition to pollution through human activities, millions of tons of _p_e_t_r_o_l_e_u_m
enter the marine environment every year from natural seepages. Despite its
toxicity, a considerable fraction of petroleum oil entering marine systems is
eliminated by the hydrocarbon-degrading activities of microbial communities.
Particularly successful is a recently discovered group of specialists, the so-
called _h_y_d_r_o_c_a_r_b_o_n_o_c_l_a_s_t_i_c_ _b_a_c_t_e_r_i_a (HCCB)._[_4_6_]

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) was the first federal agency to assume
regulatory responsibility in the United States. The Recombinant DNA Advisory
Committee of the NIH published guidelines for working with recombinant DNA and
recombinant organisms in the laboratory. Nowadays, the agencies that are

  23. _^^ A number of scientists have called for the use the term "nuclear
      transplantation," instead of "therapeutic cloning," to help reduce public
      confusion. The term "cloning" has become synonymous with "somatic cell
      nuclear transfer," a procedure that can be used for a variety of
      purposes, only one of which involves an intention to create a clone of an
      organism. They believe that the term "cloning" is best associated with
      the ultimate outcome or objective of the research and not the mechanism
      or technique used to achieve that objective. They argue that the goal of
      creating a nearly identical genetic copy of a human being is consistent
      with the term "human reproductive cloning," but the goal of creating stem
      cells for regenerative medicine is not consistent with the term
      "therapeutic cloning." The objective of the latter is to make tissue that
      is genetically compatible with that of the recipient, not to create a
      copy of the potential tissue recipient. Hence, "therapeutic cloning" is
      conceptually inaccurate. Vogelstein B., Alberts B., Shine K. (February
      2002). "Please Don't Call It Cloning!". Science 229955 (5558): 1237. _d_o_i:

      Fantasies About Human Cloning. New York: W.W. Norton. p. 11.  However,
      there is wide disagreement within scientific circles whether human
      cloning can be successfully carried out. For instance, Dr. Rudolf
      Jaenisch of Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research believes that
      reproductive cloning shortcuts basic biological processes, thus making
      normal offspring impossible to produce. In normal fertilization, the egg
      and sperm go through a long process of maturation. Cloning shortcuts this
      process by trying to reprogram the nucleus of one whole genome in minutes
      or hours. This results in gross physical malformations to subtle
      neurological disturbances. Cameron, supra note 30
