Steam and liquid water are two different forms of the same chemical substance,

In _c_h_e_m_i_s_t_r_y, a cchheemmiiccaall ssuubbssttaannccee is a form of _m_a_t_t_e_r that has constant

bonds. It can be solid, liquid, gas, or plasma.
Chemical substances are often called 'pure' to set them apart from mixtures. A
common example of a chemical substance is pure _w_a_t_e_r; it has the same
properties and the same _r_a_t_i_o of _h_y_d_r_o_g_e_n to _o_x_y_g_e_n whether it is isolated from
a river or made in a _l_a_b_o_r_a_t_o_r_y. Other chemical substances commonly encountered
in pure form are _d_i_a_m_o_n_d (carbon), _g_o_l_d, _t_a_b_l_e_ _s_a_l_t (_s_o_d_i_u_m_ _c_h_l_o_r_i_d_e) and
refined _s_u_g_a_r (_s_u_c_r_o_s_e). However, simple or seemingly pure substances found in
nature can in fact be mixtures of chemical substances. For example, tap water
may contain small amounts of dissolved sodium chloride and compounds containing
iron, calcium and many other chemical substances.
Chemical substances exist as _s_o_l_i_d_s, _l_i_q_u_i_d_s, _g_a_s_e_s, or _p_l_a_s_m_a and may change
between these _p_h_a_s_e_s_ _o_f_ _m_a_t_t_e_r with changes in _t_e_m_p_e_r_a_t_u_r_e or _p_r_e_s_s_u_r_e.
_C_h_e_m_i_c_a_l_ _r_e_a_c_t_i_o_n_s convert one chemical substance into another.
Forms of _e_n_e_r_g_y, such as _l_i_g_h_t and _h_e_a_t, are not considered to be matter, and
thus they are not "substances" in this regard.

Chemical substances (also called pure substances) may well be defined as "any
material with a definite chemical composition" in an introductory general
chemistry textbook._[_2_] According to this definition a chemical substance can
either be a pure _c_h_e_m_i_c_a_l_ _e_l_e_m_e_n_t or a pure chemical compound. But, there are
exceptions to this definition; a pure substance can also be defined as a form
of _m_a_t_t_e_r that has both definite composition and distinct properties._[_3_] The
chemical substance index published by _C_A_S also includes several _a_l_l_o_y_s of
uncertain composition._[_4_] _N_o_n_-_s_t_o_i_c_h_i_o_m_e_t_r_i_c_ _c_o_m_p_o_u_n_d_s are a special case (in
inorganic chemistry) that violates the law of constant composition, and for
them, it is sometimes difficult to draw the line between a mixture and a
compound, as in the case of _p_a_l_l_a_d_i_u_m_ _h_y_d_r_i_d_e. Broader definitions of chemicals
or chemical substances can be found, for example: "the term 'chemical
substance' means any organic or inorganic substance of a particular molecular
identity, including ‚Äì (i) any combination of such substances occurring in
whole or in part as a result of a chemical reaction or occurring in nature"_[_5_]
In _g_e_o_l_o_g_y, substances of uniform composition are called _m_i_n_e_r_a_l_s, while
physical mixtures (aggregates) of several minerals (different substances) are
defined as _r_o_c_k_s. Many minerals, however, mutually dissolve into _s_o_l_i_d
_s_o_l_u_t_i_o_n_s, such that a single rock is a uniform substance despite being a
'mixture'. _F_e_l_d_s_p_a_r_s are a common example: _a_n_o_r_t_h_o_c_l_a_s_e is an alkali aluminium
silicate, where the alkali metal is interchangeably either sodium or potassium.

The _c_o_n_c_e_p_t of a "chemical substance" became firmly established in the late
eighteenth century after work by the chemist _J_o_s_e_p_h_ _P_r_o_u_s_t on the composition
of some pure chemical compounds such as _b_a_s_i_c_ _c_o_p_p_e_r_ _c_a_r_b_o_n_a_t_e._[_6_] He deduced
that, "All samples of a compound have the same composition; that is, all
samples have the same proportions, by mass, of the elements present in the
compound." This is now known as the _l_a_w_ _o_f_ _c_o_n_s_t_a_n_t_ _c_o_m_p_o_s_i_t_i_o_n._[_7_] Later with
the advancement of methods for _c_h_e_m_i_c_a_l_ _s_y_n_t_h_e_s_i_s particularly in the realm of
_o_r_g_a_n_i_c_ _c_h_e_m_i_s_t_r_y; the discovery of many more chemical elements and new
techniques in the realm of _a_n_a_l_y_t_i_c_a_l_ _c_h_e_m_i_s_t_r_y used for isolation and
purification of elements and compounds from chemicals that led to the
establishment of modern _c_h_e_m_i_s_t_r_y, the concept was defined as is found in most
chemistry textbooks. However, there are some controversies regarding this
definition mainly because the large number of chemical substances reported in
chemistry literature need to be indexed.
_I_s_o_m_e_r_i_s_m caused much consternation to early researchers, since isomers have
exact the same composition, but differ in configuration (arrangement) of the
atoms. For example, there was much speculation for the chemical identity of
_b_e_n_z_e_n_e, until the correct structure was described by _F_r_i_e_d_r_i_c_h_ _A_u_g_u_s_t_ _K_e_k_u_l_√_©.
Likewise, the idea of _s_t_e_r_e_o_i_s_o_m_e_r_i_s_m - that atoms have rigid three-dimensional
structure and can thus form isomers that differ only in their three-dimensional
arrangement - was another crucial step in understanding the concept of distinct
chemical substances. For example, _t_a_r_t_a_r_i_c_ _a_c_i_d has three distinct isomers, a
pair of _d_i_a_s_t_e_r_e_o_m_e_r_s with one diastereomer forming two _e_n_a_n_t_i_o_m_e_r_s.

An _e_l_e_m_e_n_t is a chemical substance that is made up of a particular kind of
atoms and hence cannot be broken down or transformed by a chemical reaction
into a different element, though it can be transmutated into another element
through a _n_u_c_l_e_a_r_ _r_e_a_c_t_i_o_n. This is so, because all of the atoms in a sample of
an element have the same number of protons, though they may be different
_i_s_o_t_o_p_e_s, with differing numbers of neutrons.
As of 2012, there are 118 known elements, about 80 of which are stable ‚Äì that
is, they do not change by _r_a_d_i_o_a_c_t_i_v_e_ _d_e_c_a_y into other elements. Some elements
can occur as more than a single chemical substance (_a_l_l_o_t_r_o_p_e_s). For instance,
oxygen exists as both diatomic oxygen (O2) and _o_z_o_n_e (O3). The majority of
elements are classified as _m_e_t_a_l_s. These are elements with a characteristic
_l_u_s_t_r_e such as _i_r_o_n, _c_o_p_p_e_r, and _g_o_l_d. Metals typically conduct electricity and
heat well, and they are _m_a_l_l_e_a_b_l_e and _d_u_c_t_i_l_e._[_8_] Around a dozen elements,_[_9_]
such as _c_a_r_b_o_n, _n_i_t_r_o_g_e_n, and _o_x_y_g_e_n, are classified as _n_o_n_-_m_e_t_a_l_s. Non-metals
lack the metallic properties described above, they also have a high
_e_l_e_c_t_r_o_n_e_g_a_t_i_v_i_t_y and a tendency to form _n_e_g_a_t_i_v_e_ _i_o_n_s. Certain elements such
as _s_i_l_i_c_o_n sometimes resemble metals and sometimes resemble non-metals, and are
known as _m_e_t_a_l_l_o_i_d_s.

A pure chemical compound is a chemical substance that is composed of a
particular set of _m_o_l_e_c_u_l_e_s or _i_o_n_s. Two or more elements combined into one
substance through a _c_h_e_m_i_c_a_l_ _r_e_a_c_t_i_o_n form a _c_h_e_m_i_c_a_l_ _c_o_m_p_o_u_n_d. All compounds
are substances, but not all substances are compounds.
A chemical compound can be either atoms _b_o_n_d_e_d together in _m_o_l_e_c_u_l_e_s or
_c_r_y_s_t_a_l_s in which atoms, molecules or ions form a _c_r_y_s_t_a_l_l_i_n_e_ _l_a_t_t_i_c_e.
Compounds based primarily on carbon and hydrogen atoms are called _o_r_g_a_n_i_c
_c_o_m_p_o_u_n_d_s, and all others are called _i_n_o_r_g_a_n_i_c_ _c_o_m_p_o_u_n_d_s. Compounds containing
bonds between carbon and a metal are called _o_r_g_a_n_o_m_e_t_a_l_l_i_c_ _c_o_m_p_o_u_n_d_s.
Compounds in which components share electrons are known as _c_o_v_a_l_e_n_t compounds.
Compounds consisting of oppositely charged _i_o_n_s are known as _i_o_n_i_c compounds,
or _s_a_l_t_s.
In organic chemistry, there can be more than one chemical compound with the
same composition and molecular weight. Generally, these are called _i_s_o_m_e_r_s.
Isomers usually have substantially different chemical properties, may be
isolated and do not spontaneously convert to each other. A common example is
_g_l_u_c_o_s_e vs. _f_r_u_c_t_o_s_e. The former is an _a_l_d_e_h_y_d_e, the latter is a _k_e_t_o_n_e. Their
interconversion requires either _e_n_z_y_m_a_t_i_c or _a_c_i_d_-_b_a_s_e_ _c_a_t_a_l_y_s_i_s. However,
there are also _t_a_u_t_o_m_e_r_s, where isomerization occurs spontaneously, such that a
pure substance cannot be isolated into its tautomers. A common example is
_g_l_u_c_o_s_e, which has open-chain and ring forms. One cannot manufacture pure open-
chain glucose because glucose spontaneously cyclizes to the _h_e_m_i_a_c_e_t_a_l form.

All matter consists of various elements and chemical compounds, but these are
often intimately mixed together. Mixtures contain more than one chemical
substance, and they do not have a fixed composition. In principle, they can be
separated into the component substances by purely _m_e_c_h_a_n_i_c_a_l processes. _B_u_t_t_e_r,
_s_o_i_l and _w_o_o_d are common examples of mixtures.
Grey iron metal and yellow _s_u_l_f_u_r are both chemical elements, and they can be
mixed together in any ratio to form a yellow-grey mixture. No chemical process
occurs, and the material can be identified as a mixture by the fact that the
sulfur and the iron can be separated by a mechanical process, such as using a
_m_a_g_n_e_t to attract the iron away from the sulfur.
In contrast, if iron and sulfur are heated together in a certain ratio (1 atom
of iron for each atom of sulfur, or by weight, 56 _g_r_a_m_s (1 _m_o_l) of iron to
32 grams (1 mol) of sulfur), a chemical reaction takes place and a new
substance is formed, the compound _i_r_o_n_(_I_I_)_ _s_u_l_f_i_d_e, with chemical formula FeS.
The resulting compound has all the properties of a chemical substance and is
not a mixture. Iron(II) sulfide has its own distinct properties such as _m_e_l_t_i_n_g
_p_o_i_n_t and _s_o_l_u_b_i_l_i_t_y, and the two elements cannot be separated using normal
mechanical processes; a magnet will be unable to recover the iron, since there
is no metallic iron present in the compound.

While the term chemical substance is a precise technical term that is
synonymous with "chemical" for professional chemists, the meaning of the word
chemical varies for non-chemists within the English speaking world or those
using English. For industries, government and society in general in some
countries,_[_1_0_] the word chemical includes a wider class of substances that
contain many mixtures of such chemical substances, often finding application in
many vocations._[_1_1_] In countries that require a list of ingredients in
products, the "chemicals" listed would be equated with "chemical substances".
_[_1_2_]
Within the chemical industry, manufactured "chemicals" are chemical substances,
which can be classified by production volume into bulk chemicals, _f_i_n_e
_c_h_e_m_i_c_a_l_s and chemicals found in research only. Bulk chemicals are produced in
very large quantities, usually with highly optimized continuous processes and
to a relatively low price. Fine chemicals are produced at a high cost in small
quantities for special low-volume applications such as biocides,
pharmaceuticals and speciality chemicals for technical applications. Research
chemicals are produced individually for research, such as when searching for
synthetic routes or screening substances for pharmaceutical activity. In
effect, their price per gram is very high, although they are not sold. The
cause of the difference in production volume is the complexity of the molecular
structure of the chemical. Bulk chemicals are usually much less complex. While
fine chemicals may be more complex, many of them are simple enough to be sold
as "building blocks" in the synthesis of more complex molecules targeted for
single use, as named above. The production of a chemical includes not only its
synthesis but also its purification to eliminate by-products and impurities
involved in the synthesis. The last step in production should be the analysis
of batch lots of chemicals in order to identify and quantify the percentages of
impurities for the buyer of the chemicals. The required purity and analysis
depends on the application, but higher tolerance of impurities is usually
expected in the production of bulk chemicals. Thus, the user of the chemical in
the US might choose between the bulk or "technical grade" with higher amounts
of impurities or a much purer "pharmaceutical grade" (labeled "USP", _U_n_i_t_e_d
_S_t_a_t_e_s_ _P_h_a_r_m_a_c_o_p_e_i_a).

Every chemical substance has one or more _s_y_s_t_e_m_a_t_i_c_ _n_a_m_e_s, usually named
according to the _I_U_P_A_C_ _r_u_l_e_s_ _f_o_r_ _n_a_m_i_n_g. An alternative system is used by the
_C_h_e_m_i_c_a_l_ _A_b_s_t_r_a_c_t_s_ _S_e_r_v_i_c_e (CAS).
Many compounds are also known by their more common, simpler names, many of
which predate the systematic name. For example, the long-known _s_u_g_a_r _g_l_u_c_o_s_e is
now systematically named 6-(hydroxymethyl)oxane-2,3,4,5-tetrol. _N_a_t_u_r_a_l
_p_r_o_d_u_c_t_s and _p_h_a_r_m_a_c_e_u_t_i_c_a_l_s are also given simpler names, for example the mild
pain-killer _N_a_p_r_o_x_e_n is the more common name for the chemical compound (S)-6-
methoxy-Œ±-methyl-2-naphthaleneacetic acid.
_C_h_e_m_i_s_t_s frequently refer to _c_h_e_m_i_c_a_l_ _c_o_m_p_o_u_n_d_s using _c_h_e_m_i_c_a_l_ _f_o_r_m_u_l_a_e or
_m_o_l_e_c_u_l_a_r_ _s_t_r_u_c_t_u_r_e of the compound. There has been a phenomenal growth in the
number of chemical compounds being synthesized (or isolated), and then reported
in the _s_c_i_e_n_t_i_f_i_c_ _l_i_t_e_r_a_t_u_r_e by professional chemists around the world._[_1_3_] An
enormous number of chemical compounds are possible through the chemical
combination of the known chemical elements. As of May 2011, about sixty million
chemical compounds are known._[_1_4_] The names of many of these compounds are
often nontrivial and hence not very easy to remember or cite accurately. Also
it is difficult to keep the track of them in the literature. Several
international organizations like _I_U_P_A_C and CAS have initiated steps to make
such tasks easier. CAS provides the abstracting services of the chemical
literature, and provides a numerical identifier, known as _C_A_S_ _r_e_g_i_s_t_r_y_ _n_u_m_b_e_r
to each chemical substance that been reported in the chemical literature (such
as _c_h_e_m_i_s_t_r_y_ _j_o_u_r_n_a_l_s and _p_a_t_e_n_t_s). This information is compiled as a _d_a_t_a_b_a_s_e
and is popularly known as the Chemical substances index. Other computer-
friendly systems that have been developed for substance information, are:
_S_M_I_L_E_S and the _I_n_t_e_r_n_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _C_h_e_m_i_c_a_l_ _I_d_e_n_t_i_f_i_e_r or InChI.
