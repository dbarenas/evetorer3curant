Condo construction in Canada
In general, there are four types of construction:[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]
   1. Residential Building construction
   2. Industrial construction
   3. Commercial Building construction
   4. Heavy Civil construction
Each type of construction project requires a unique team to plan, design,
construct and maintain the project.

Building construction is the process of adding structure to _r_e_a_l_ _p_r_o_p_e_r_t_y. The
vast majority of building construction jobs are small renovations, such as
addition of a room, or renovation of a bathroom. Often, the owner of the
property acts as laborer, paymaster, and design team for the entire _p_r_o_j_e_c_t.
However, all building construction projects include some elements in common â€“
design, financial, estimating and legal considerations. Many projects of
varying sizes reach undesirable end results, such as structural collapse, cost
overruns, and/or litigation reason, those with experience in the field make
detailed plans and maintain careful oversight during the project to ensure a
positive outcome.
Commercial _b_u_i_l_d_i_n_g construction is procured privately or publicly utilizing
various delivery methodologies, including cost estimating, hard bid, negotiated
price, traditional, management contracting, construction management-at-risk,
design & build and design-build bridging.
Residential construction practices, technologies, and resources must conform to
local building authority regulations and codes of practice. Materials readily
available in the area generally dictate the construction materials used (e.g.
brick versus stone, versus timber). Cost of construction on a per square meter
(or per square foot) basis for houses can vary dramatically based on site
conditions, local regulations, economies of scale (custom designed homes are
always more expensive to build) and the availability of skilled tradespeople.
As residential construction (as well as all other types of construction) can
generate a lot of _w_a_s_t_e, careful planning again is needed here.
The most popular method of residential construction in the United States is
wood framed construction. As efficiency codes have come into effect in recent
years, new construction technologies and methods have emerged. University
Construction Management departments are on the cutting edge of the newest
methods of construction intended to improve efficiency, performance and reduce
_c_o_n_s_t_r_u_c_t_i_o_n_ _w_a_s_t_e.
New techniques of building construction are being researched, made possible by
advances in _3_D_ _p_r_i_n_t_i_n_g technology. In a form of additive building
construction, similar to the _a_d_d_i_t_i_v_e_ _m_a_n_u_f_a_c_t_u_r_i_n_g techniques for manufactured
parts, _b_u_i_l_d_i_n_g_ _p_r_i_n_t_i_n_g is making it possible to flexibly construct small
commercial buildings and private habitations in around 20 hours, with built-in
plumbing and electrical facilities, in one continuous build, using large 3D
printers._[_1_] Working versions of 3D-printing building technology are already

In the modern industrialized world, construction usually involves the
translation of designs into reality. A formal design team may be assembled to
plan the physical proceedings, and to integrate those proceedings with the
other parts. The design usually consists of _d_r_a_w_i_n_g_s and _s_p_e_c_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n_s,
usually prepared by a design team including _s_u_r_v_e_y_o_r_s, _c_i_v_i_l_ _e_n_g_i_n_e_e_r_s, cost
engineers (or _q_u_a_n_t_i_t_y_ _s_u_r_v_e_y_o_r_s), _m_e_c_h_a_n_i_c_a_l_ _e_n_g_i_n_e_e_r_s, _e_l_e_c_t_r_i_c_a_l_ _e_n_g_i_n_e_e_r_s,
_s_t_r_u_c_t_u_r_a_l_ _e_n_g_i_n_e_e_r_s, _f_i_r_e_ _p_r_o_t_e_c_t_i_o_n_ _e_n_g_i_n_e_e_r_s, planning _c_o_n_s_u_l_t_a_n_t_s,
architectural consultants, and archaeological consultants. The design team is
most commonly employed by (i.e. in contract with) the property owner. Under
this system, once the design is completed by the design team, a number of
construction companies or construction management companies may then be asked
to make a bid for the work, either based directly on the design, or on the
basis of drawings and a _b_i_l_l_ _o_f_ _q_u_a_n_t_i_t_i_e_s provided by a _q_u_a_n_t_i_t_y_ _s_u_r_v_e_y_o_r.
Following evaluation of bids, the owner will typically award a contract to the
most cost efficient bidder.
The modern trend in design is toward integration of previously separated
specialties, especially among large firms. In the past, architects, interior
designers, engineers, developers, construction managers, and general
contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies, even in the
larger firms. Presently, a firm that is nominally an "architecture" or
"construction management" firm may have experts from all related fields as
employees, or to have an associated company that provides each necessary skill.
Thus, each such firm may offer itself as "one-stop shopping" for a construction
project, from beginning to end. This is designated as a "design Build" contract
where the contractor is given a performance specification and must undertake
the project from design to construction, while adhering to the performance
specifications.
Several project structures can assist the owner in this integration, including
design-build, partnering and construction management. In general, each of these
project structures allows the owner to integrate the services of architects,
interior designers, engineers and constructors throughout design and
construction. In response, many companies are growing beyond traditional
offerings of design or construction services alone and are placing more
emphasis on establishing relationships with other necessary participants
through the design-build process.
The increasing complexity of construction projects creates the need for design
professionals trained in all phases of the project's life-cycle and develop an
appreciation of the building as an advanced technological system requiring
close integration of many sub-systems and their individual components,
including sustainability. _BB_uu_ii_ll_dd_ii_nn_gg_ _ee_nn_gg_ii_nn_ee_ee_rr_ii_nn_gg is an emerging discipline that

Construction projects can suffer from preventable financial problems. UUnnddeerrbbiiddss
ask for too little money to complete the project. _C_a_s_h_ _f_l_o_w problems exist when
the present amount of funding cannot cover the current costs for labour and
materials, and because they are a matter of having sufficient funds at a
specific time, can arise even when the overall total is enough. _F_r_a_u_d is a
problem in many fields, but is notoriously prevalent in the construction field
[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]. Financial planning for the project is intended to ensure
that a solid plan with adequate safeguards and contingency plans are in place
before the project is started and is required to ensure that the plan is
properly executed over the life of the project.
_M_o_r_t_g_a_g_e_ _b_a_n_k_e_r_s, _a_c_c_o_u_n_t_a_n_t_s, and _c_o_s_t_ _e_n_g_i_n_e_e_r_s are likely participants in
creating an overall plan for the financial management of the building
construction project. The presence of the mortgage banker is highly likely,
even in relatively small projects since the owner's equity in the property is
the most obvious source of funding for a building project. Accountants act to
study the expected monetary flow over the life of the project and to monitor
the payouts throughout the process. Cost engineers and _e_s_t_i_m_a_t_o_r_s apply
expertise to relate the work and materials involved to a proper valuation. Cost
overruns with government projects have occurred when the contractor was able to
identify change orders or changes in the project resulting in large increases
in cost, which are not subject to competition by other firm as they have
already been eliminated from consideration after the initial bid._[_4_]
Large projects can involve highly complex financial plans and often start with
a conceptual estimate performed by a _b_u_i_l_d_i_n_g_ _e_s_t_i_m_a_t_o_r. As portions of a
project are completed, they may be sold, supplanting one lender or owner for
another, while the logistical requirements of having the right trades and
materials available for each stage of the building construction project carries
forward. In many English-speaking countries, but not the United States,
projects typically use quantity surveyors.

A construction project must fit into the legal framework governing the
property. These include governmental regulations on the use of property, and
obligations that are created in the process of construction.
The project must adhere to _z_o_n_i_n_g and _b_u_i_l_d_i_n_g_ _c_o_d_e requirements. Constructing
a project that fails to adhere to codes will not benefit the owner. Some legal
requirements come from _m_a_l_u_m_ _i_n_ _s_e considerations, or the desire to prevent
things that are indisputably bad â€“ bridge collapses or explosions. Other
legal requirements come from _m_a_l_u_m_ _p_r_o_h_i_b_i_t_u_m considerations, or things that
are a matter of custom or expectation, such as isolating businesses to a
business district and residences to a residential district. An attorney may
seek changes or exemptions in the law governing the land where the building
will be built, either by arguing that a rule is inapplicable (the bridge design
will not collapse), or that the custom is no longer needed (acceptance of live-
work spaces has grown in the community).
A construction project is a complex net of _c_o_n_t_r_a_c_t_s and other legal
obligations, each of which must be carefully considered. A contract is the
exchange of a set of obligations between two or more parties, but it is not so
simple a matter as trying to get the other side to agree to as much as possible
in exchange for as little as possible. The time element in construction means
that a delay costs money, and in cases of bottlenecks, the delay can be
extremely expensive. Thus, the contracts must be designed to ensure that each
side is capable of performing the obligations set out. Contracts that set out
clear expectations and clear paths to accomplishing those expectations are far
more likely to result in the project flowing smoothly, whereas poorly drafted
contracts lead to confusion and collapse.
Legal advisors in the beginning of a construction project seek to identify
ambiguities and other potential sources of trouble in the contract structure,
and to present options for preventing problems. Throughout the process of the
project, they work to avoid and resolve conflicts that arise. In each case, the

Design, finance, and legal aspects overlap and interrelate. The design must be
not only structurally sound and appropriate for the use and location, but must
also be financially possible to build, and legal to use. The financial
structure must accommodate the need for building the design provided, and must
pay amounts that are legally owed. The legal structure must integrate the
design into the surrounding legal framework, and enforce the financial
consequences of the construction process.

obtain a building. There are many different methods of construction
procurement; however the three most common types of procurement are:
   1. Traditional (Design-bid-build)
   2. Design and build
   3. Management contracting
There is also a growing number of new forms of procurement that involve
relationship contracting where the emphasis is on a co-operative relationship
between the principal and contractor and other stakeholders within a
construction project. New forms include partnering such as Public-Private
Partnering (PPPs) aka _p_r_i_v_a_t_e_ _f_i_n_a_n_c_e_ _i_n_i_t_i_a_t_i_v_e_s (PFIs) and alliances such as
"pure" or "project" alliances and "impure" or "strategic" alliances. The focus
on co-operation is to ameliorate the many problems that arise from the often
highly competitive and adversarial practices within the construction industry.

This is the most common method of construction procurement and is well
established and recognized. In this arrangement, the architect or _e_n_g_i_n_e_e_r acts
as the project coordinator. His or her role is to design the works, prepare the
specifications and produce construction drawings, administer the contract,
_t_e_n_d_e_r the works, and manage the works from inception to completion. There are
direct contractual links between the architect's client and the main
contractor. Any subcontractor will have a direct contractual relationship with
the main contractor.

This approach has become more common in recent years and involves the client
contracting a single entity to both provide a design and to build that design.
In some cases, the Design and Build (D & B) package can also include finding
the site, arranging funding and applying for all necessary statutory consents.
The owner produces a list of requirements for a project, giving an overall view
of the project's goals. Several D&B contractors present different ideas about
how to accomplish these goals. The owner selects the ideas he or she likes best
and hires the appropriate contractor. Often, it is not just one contractor, but
a consortium of several contractors working together. Once a contractor (or a
consortium/consortia) has been hired, they begin building the first phase of
the project. As they build phase 1, they design phase 2. This is in contrast to
a design-bid-build contract, where the project is completely designed by the
owner, then bid on, then completed.

In this arrangement the client plays an active role in the procurement system
by entering into separate contracts with the designer (architect or _e_n_g_i_n_e_e_r),
the _c_o_n_s_t_r_u_c_t_i_o_n_ _m_a_n_a_g_e_r, and individual _t_r_a_d_e_ _c_o_n_t_r_a_c_t_o_r_s. The client takes on
the contractual role, while the construction or project manager provides the
active role of managing the separate trade contracts, and ensuring that they
all work smoothly and effectively together.
Management procurement systems are often used to speed up the procurement
processes, allow the client greater flexibility in design variation throughout
the contract, the ability to appoint individual work contractors, separate
contractual responsibility on each individual throughout the contract, and to
provide greater client control.

agency or sub-agency which regulates the construction process. In most cases,
this is the _m_u_n_i_c_i_p_a_l_i_t_y in which the building is located. However,
construction performed for supra-municipal authorities are usually regulated
directly by the owning authority, which becomes the AHJ.
Before the foundation can be dug, contractors are typically required to verify
and have existing utility lines marked, either by the utilities themselves or
through a company specializing in such services. This lessens the likelihood of
damage to the existing electrical, water, sewage, phone, and cable facilities,
which could cause outages and potentially hazardous situations. During the
construction of a building, the municipal building inspector inspects the
building periodically to ensure that the construction adheres to the approved
plans and the local _bb_uu_ii_ll_dd_ii_nn_gg_ _cc_oo_dd_ee. Once construction is complete and a final

There are many routes to the different _c_a_r_e_e_r_s within the construction
industry. There are three main tiers based on educational background and
training, which vary by country:
    * Unskilled and semi-skilled â€“ General site labor with little or no
      construction qualifications.
    * Skilled â€“ _T_r_a_d_e_s_m_e_n who've served apprenticeships, typically in _l_a_b_o_r
      _u_n_i_o_n_s, and on-site managers who possess extensive knowledge and
      experience in their _c_r_a_f_t or _p_r_o_f_e_s_s_i_o_n.
    * Technical and management â€“ Personnel with the greatest educational
      qualifications, usually _g_r_a_d_u_a_t_e_ _d_e_g_r_e_e_s, trained to design, manage and
      instruct the construction process.
Skilled occupations include _c_a_r_p_e_n_t_e_r_s, _e_l_e_c_t_r_i_c_i_a_n_s, _p_l_u_m_b_e_r_s, _i_r_o_n_w_o_r_k_e_r_s,
_m_a_s_o_n_s, and many other manual crafts, as well as those involved in project
management. In the _U_K these require _f_u_r_t_h_e_r_ _e_d_u_c_a_t_i_o_n qualifications, often in
_v_o_c_a_t_i_o_n_a_l subject areas. These qualifications are either obtained directly
after the completion of _c_o_m_p_u_l_s_o_r_y_ _e_d_u_c_a_t_i_o_n or through "on the job"

apprenticeships were commenced in 2007._[_1_0_]

technical knowledge is required. These professions also hold more legal
responsibility. A short list of the main careers with an outline of the
educational requirements are given below:

The first _h_u_t_s and shelters were constructed by hand or with simple tools. As
_c_i_t_i_e_s grew during the _B_r_o_n_z_e_ _A_g_e, a class of professional _c_r_a_f_t_s_m_e_n, like
_b_r_i_c_k_l_a_y_e_r_s and _c_a_r_p_e_n_t_e_r_s, appeared. Occasionally, _s_l_a_v_e_s were used for
construction work. In the _M_i_d_d_l_e_ _A_g_e_s, these were organized into _g_u_i_l_d_s. In the
19th century, steam-powered machinery appeared, and later diesel- and electric
powered vehicles such as _c_r_a_n_e_s, _e_x_c_a_v_a_t_o_r_s and _b_u_l_l_d_o_z_e_r_s. Architecture and
construction involves creating awesome structures that can show the beauty and
creativity of the human intellect.
