Design, when applied to _f_a_s_h_i_o_n, includes considering aesthetics as well as
function in the final form.
DDeessiiggnn is the creation of a _p_l_a_n or _c_o_n_v_e_n_t_i_o_n for the construction of an
object or a system (as in _a_r_c_h_i_t_e_c_t_u_r_a_l_ _b_l_u_e_p_r_i_n_t_s, _e_n_g_i_n_e_e_r_i_n_g_ _d_r_a_w_i_n_g_s,

different connotations in different fields (see _d_e_s_i_g_n_ _d_i_s_c_i_p_l_i_n_e_s below). In
some cases the direct construction of an object (as in _p_o_t_t_e_r_y, _e_n_g_i_n_e_e_r_i_n_g,
_m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t, _c_o_w_b_o_y_ _c_o_d_i_n_g and _g_r_a_p_h_i_c_ _d_e_s_i_g_n) is also considered to be design.
More formally design has been defined as follows.
      (noun) a specification of an _o_b_j_e_c_t, manifested by an _a_g_e_n_t, intended to
      accomplish _g_o_a_l_s, in a particular _e_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t, using a set of primitive
      components, satisfying a set of _r_e_q_u_i_r_e_m_e_n_t_s, subject to constraints;
      (verb, transitive) to create a design, in an _e_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t (where the
      designer operates)_[_2_]
Another definition for design is a roadmap or a strategic approach for someone
to achieve a unique expectation. It defines the specifications, plans,
parameters, costs, activities, processes and how and what to do within legal,
political, social, environmental, safety and economic constraints in achieving
that objective._[_3_]
Here, a "specification" can be manifested as either a plan or a finished
product, and "primitives" are the elements from which the design object is
composed.
With such a broad denotation, there is no _u_n_i_v_e_r_s_a_l_ _l_a_n_g_u_a_g_e or _u_n_i_f_y_i_n_g
_i_n_s_t_i_t_u_t_i_o_n for designers of all disciplines. This allows for many differing
philosophies and approaches toward the subject (see _P_h_i_l_o_s_o_p_h_i_e_s_ _a_n_d_ _s_t_u_d_i_e_s_ _o_f
_d_e_s_i_g_n, below).
The person designing is called a _d_e_s_i_g_n_e_r, which is also a term used for people
who work professionally in one of the various design areas, usually also
specifying which area is being dealt with (such as a fashion designer, concept
designer or web designer). A designer's sequence of activities is called a
design process. The scientific study of design is called _d_e_s_i_g_n_ _s_c_i_e_n_c_e._[_4_]_[_5_]
_[_6_]
Designing often necessitates considering the _a_e_s_t_h_e_t_i_c, _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n_a_l, economic
and sociopolitical dimensions of both the design object and design process. It
may involve considerable _r_e_s_e_a_r_c_h, _t_h_o_u_g_h_t, _m_o_d_e_l_i_n_g, interactive _a_d_j_u_s_t_m_e_n_t,
and re-design._[_7_] Meanwhile, diverse kinds of objects may be designed,
including _c_l_o_t_h_i_n_g, _g_r_a_p_h_i_c_a_l_ _u_s_e_r_ _i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e_s, _s_k_y_s_c_r_a_p_e_r_s, _c_o_r_p_o_r_a_t_e

Substantial disagreement exists concerning how designers in many fields,
whether amateur or professional, alone or in teams, produce designs. Dorst and
Dijkhuis argued that "there are many ways of describing design processes" and
discussed "two basic and fundamentally different ways",_[_9_] both of which have
several names. The prevailing view has been called "The Rational Model",_[_1_0_]
"Technical Problem Solving"_[_1_1_] and "The Reason-Centric Perspective"._[_1_2_] The
alternative view has been called "Reflection-in-Action",_[_1_1_] "co-evolution"_[_1_3_]
and "The Action-Centric Perspective"._[_1_2_]

The Rational Model was independently developed by _S_i_m_o_n_[_1_4_] and Pahl and Beitz.
_[_1_5_] It posits that:
   1. designers attempt to _o_p_t_i_m_i_z_e a design candidate for known _c_o_n_s_t_r_a_i_n_t_s
      and _o_b_j_e_c_t_i_v_e_s,
   2. the design process is plan-driven,
   3. the design process is understood in terms of a discrete sequence of
      stages.
The Rational Model is based on a _r_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_i_s_t_ _p_h_i_l_o_s_o_p_h_y_[_1_0_] and underlies the

The Rational Model has been widely criticized on two primary grounds
   1. Designers do not work this way â€“ extensive empirical evidence has
      demonstrated that designers do not act as the rational model suggests.
      _[_2_1_]
   2. Unrealistic assumptions â€“ goals are often unknown when a design project

The Action-Centric Perspective is a label given to a collection of interrelated
concepts, which are antithetical to The Rational Model._[_1_2_] It posits that:
   1. designers use _c_r_e_a_t_i_v_i_t_y and _e_m_o_t_i_o_n to generate design candidates,
   2. the design process is _i_m_p_r_o_v_i_s_e_d,
   3. no universal sequence of stages is apparent â€“ analysis, design and

Substantial empirical evidence supports the veracity of this perspective in
describing the actions of real designers._[_2_1_] Like the Rational Model, the
Action-Centric model sees design as informed by research and knowledge.
However, research and knowledge are brought into the design process through the
judgment and common sense of designers â€“ by designers "thinking on their
feet" â€“ more than through the predictable and controlled process stipulated
by the Rational Model. Designers' context-dependent experience and professional
judgment take center stage more than technical rationality._[_7_]

At least two views of design activity are consistent with the Action-Centric
Perspective. Both involve three basic activities.
In the Reflection-in-Action paradigm, designers alternate between "framing,"
"making moves," and "evaluate moves." "Framing" refers to conceptualizing the
problem, i.e., defining goals and objectives. A "move" is a tentative design
decision. The evaluation process may lead to further moves in the design._[_1_1_]
In the Sensemaking-Coevolution-Implementation Framework, designers alternate
between its three titular activities. _S_e_n_s_e_m_a_k_i_n_g includes both framing and
evaluating moves. Implementation is the process of constructing the design
object. Coevolution is "the process where the design agent simultaneously
refines its mental picture of the design object based on its mental picture of
the context, and vice versa."_[_2_5_]

There are countless philosophies for guiding design as the design values and
its accompanying aspects within modern design vary, both between different
schools of thought and among practicing designers._[_2_7_] Design philosophies are
usually for determining design goals. A design goal may range from solving the
least significant individual problem of the smallest element, to the most
_h_o_l_i_s_t_i_c influential _u_t_o_p_i_a_n goals. Design goals are usually for guiding
design. However, conflicts over immediate and minor goals may lead to
questioning the purpose of design, perhaps to set better long term or ultimate
goals.

Design philosophies are fundamental guiding principles that dictate how a
designer approaches his/her practice. Reflections on _m_a_t_e_r_i_a_l_ _c_u_l_t_u_r_e and
environmental concerns (_S_u_s_t_a_i_n_a_b_l_e_ _d_e_s_i_g_n) can guide a design philosophy. One
example is the _F_i_r_s_t_ _T_h_i_n_g_s_ _F_i_r_s_t_ _m_a_n_i_f_e_s_t_o which was launched within the
graphic design community and states "We propose a reversal of priorities in
favor of more useful, lasting and democratic forms of communication â€“ a
mindshift away from product marketing and toward the exploration and production
of a new kind of meaning. The scope of debate is shrinking; it must expand.
Consumerism is running uncontested; it must be challenged by other perspectives
expressed, in part, through the visual languages and resources of design."_[_2_8_]
In The Sciences of the Artificial by polymath _H_e_r_b_e_r_t_ _A_._ _S_i_m_o_n the author
asserts design to be a meta-discipline of all professions. "Engineers are not
the only professional designers. Everyone designs who devises courses of action
aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones. The intellectual
activity that produces material artifacts is no different fundamentally from
the one that prescribes remedies for a sick patient or the one that devises a
new sales plan for a company or a social welfare policy for a state. Design, so
construed, is the core of all professional training; it is the principal mark
that distinguishes the professions from the sciences. Schools of engineering,
as well as schools of architecture, business, education, law, and medicine, are
all centrally concerned with the process of design."_[_2_9_]

A design approach is a general philosophy that may or may not include a guide
for specific methods. Some are to guide the overall goal of the design. Other
approaches are to guide the tendencies of the designer. A combination of
approaches may be used if they don't conflict.
Some popular approaches include:
    * _K_I_S_S_ _p_r_i_n_c_i_p_l_e, (Keep it Simple Stupid), which strives to eliminate
      unnecessary complications.

      multiple methods of doing the same thing.
    * _U_s_e_-_c_e_n_t_e_r_e_d_ _d_e_s_i_g_n, which focuses on the goals and tasks associated with
      the use of the artifact, rather than focusing on the end user.
    * _U_s_e_r_-_c_e_n_t_e_r_e_d_ _d_e_s_i_g_n, which focuses on the needs, wants, and limitations
      of the end user of the designed artifact.
    * _C_r_i_t_i_c_a_l_ _d_e_s_i_g_n uses designed artifacts as an embodied critique or
      commentary on existing values, morals, and practices in a culture.
    * _S_e_r_v_i_c_e_ _d_e_s_i_g_n designing or organizing the experience around a product,
      the service associated with a product's use.

      environments compatible with those physical and sensory impairments
      associated with human aging and which limit major activities of daily
      living.
    * Speculative design, the speculative design process doesnâ€™t necessarily
      define a specific problem to solve, but establishes a provocative
      starting point from which a design process emerges. The result is an
      evolution of fluctuating iteration and reflection using designed objects
      to provoke questions and stimulate discussion in academic and research
      settings

The boundaries between art and design are blurred, largely due to a range of
applications both for the term 'art' and the term 'design'. _A_p_p_l_i_e_d_ _a_r_t_s has
been used as an umbrella term to define fields of _i_n_d_u_s_t_r_i_a_l_ _d_e_s_i_g_n, _g_r_a_p_h_i_c

used in historical discourses to describe craft objects, and also sits within
the umbrella of _A_p_p_l_i_e_d_ _a_r_t_s. In _g_r_a_p_h_i_c_ _a_r_t_s (2D image making that ranges from

shared across the disciplines within the _A_p_p_l_i_e_d_ _a_r_t_s and _F_i_n_e_ _a_r_t. Mark

"natural", and part of "our sense of 'rightness'."_[_3_0_] However, the intended
application and context of the resulting works will vary greatly.

In _e_n_g_i_n_e_e_r_i_n_g, design is a component of the engineering process. Many

design as: "To conceive or fashion in the mind; invent," and "To formulate a
plan", and defines engineering as: "The application of scientific and
mathematical principles to practical ends such as the design, manufacture, and
operation of efficient and economical structures, machines, processes, and
systems."._[_3_1_]_[_3_2_] Both are forms of problem-solving with a defined distinction
being the application of "scientific and mathematical principles". The
increasingly scientific focus of engineering in practice, however, has raised
the importance of new more "human-centered" fields of design._[_3_3_] How much
science is applied in a design is a question of what is considered "_s_c_i_e_n_c_e".
Along with the question of what is considered science, there is _s_o_c_i_a_l_ _s_c_i_e_n_c_e

The relationship between design and _p_r_o_d_u_c_t_i_o_n is one of planning and
executing. In theory, the plan should anticipate and compensate for potential
problems in the execution process. Design involves problem-solving and
_c_r_e_a_t_i_v_i_t_y. In contrast, production involves a routine or pre-planned process.
A design may also be a mere plan that does not include a production or
engineering process, although a working knowledge of such processes is usually
expected of designers. In some cases, it may be unnecessary and/or impractical
to expect a designer with a broad _m_u_l_t_i_d_i_s_c_i_p_l_i_n_a_r_y knowledge required for such
designs to also have a detailed _s_p_e_c_i_a_l_i_z_e_d knowledge of how to produce the
product.
Design and production are intertwined in many _c_r_e_a_t_i_v_e_ _p_r_o_f_e_s_s_i_o_n_a_l careers,
meaning problem-solving is part of execution and the reverse. As the cost of
rearrangement increases, the need for separating design from production
increases as well. For example, a high-budget project, such as a _s_k_y_s_c_r_a_p_e_r,
requires separating (design) _a_r_c_h_i_t_e_c_t_u_r_e from (production) _c_o_n_s_t_r_u_c_t_i_o_n. A
Low-budget project, such as a _l_o_c_a_l_l_y_ _p_r_i_n_t_e_d office party invitation _f_l_y_e_r,
can be rearranged and printed dozens of times at the low cost of a few sheets
of paper, a few drops of ink, and less than one hour's pay of a _d_e_s_k_t_o_p
_p_u_b_l_i_s_h_e_r.
This is not to say that production never involves problem-solving or
creativity, nor that design always involves creativity. Designs are rarely
perfect and are sometimes repetitive. The imperfection of a design may task a
production position (e.g. _p_r_o_d_u_c_t_i_o_n_ _a_r_t_i_s_t, _c_o_n_s_t_r_u_c_t_i_o_n_ _w_o_r_k_e_r) with
utilizing creativity or problem-solving skills to compensate for what was
overlooked in the design process. Likewise, a design may be a simple repetition
(copy) of a known preexisting solution, requiring minimal, if any, creativity
or problem-solving skills from the designer.

"Process design" (in contrast to "design process" mentioned _a_b_o_v_e) refers to
the planning of routine steps of a process aside from the expected result.
Processes (in general) are treated as a product of design, not the method of
design. The term originated with the industrial _d_e_s_i_g_n_i_n_g_ _o_f _c_h_e_m_i_c_a_l
_p_r_o_c_e_s_s_e_s. With the increasing complexities of the _i_n_f_o_r_m_a_t_i_o_n_ _a_g_e, consultants
and executives have found the term useful to describe the _d_e_s_i_g_n_ _o_f_ _b_u_s_i_n_e_s_s
_p_r_o_c_e_s_s_e_s as well as _m_a_n_u_f_a_c_t_u_r_i_n_g_ _p_r_o_c_e_s_s_e_s.
