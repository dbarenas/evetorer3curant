E-learning includes numerous types of media that deliver text, audio, images,
animation, and streaming video, and includes technology applications and
processes such as audio or video tape, satellite TV, CD-ROM, and computer-based
learning, as well as local intranet/extranet and _w_e_b-based learning.

learning is suited to _d_i_s_t_a_n_c_e_ _l_e_a_r_n_i_n_g and flexible learning, but it can also
be used in conjunction with face-to-face teaching, in which case the term

It is commonly thought that new technologies make a big difference in
education._[_2_] Many proponents of e-learning believe[_a_c_c_o_r_d_i_n_g_ _t_o_ _w_h_o_m_?] that
everyone must be equipped with basic knowledge of technology, as well as use it
as a vehicle for reaching educational goals.

E-learning refers to the use of technology in learning and education. There are
several aspects to describing the intellectual and technical development of e-
learning, which can be categorized into discrete areas. These are addressed in
turn in the sections of this article:
   1. e-learning as an eedduuccaattiioonnaall aapppprrooaacchh or tool that supports traditional
      subjects;
   2. e-learning as a tteecchhnnoollooggiiccaall mmeeddiiuumm that assists in the communication of
      knowledge, and its development and exchange;
   3. e-learning itself as an eedduuccaattiioonnaall ssuubbjjeecctt; such courses may be called
      "Computer Studies" or "_I_n_f_o_r_m_a_t_i_o_n_ _a_n_d_ _C_o_m_m_u_n_i_c_a_t_i_o_n_ _T_e_c_h_n_o_l_o_g_y (ICT)";
   4. e-learning aaddmmiinniissttrraattiivvee ttoooollss such as education management information
      systems (EMIS).

E-learning is a broadly inclusive term that describes _e_d_u_c_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _t_e_c_h_n_o_l_o_g_y
that electronically or technologically supports _l_e_a_r_n_i_n_g and _t_e_a_c_h_i_n_g. _B_e_r_n_a_r_d
_L_u_s_k_i_n, a pioneer of e-learning, advocates that the "e" should be interpreted
to mean "exciting, energetic, enthusiastic, emotional, extended, excellent, and
educational" in addition to "electronic." This broad interpretation focuses on
new applications and developments, and also brings learning and _m_e_d_i_a
_p_s_y_c_h_o_l_o_g_y into consideration._[_3_] Parks suggested that the "e" should refer to
"everything, everyone, engaging, easy"._[_4_]
Depending on whether a particular aspect, component or delivery method is given
emphasis, a wide array of similar or overlapping terms has been used. As such,
e-learning encompasses _m_u_l_t_i_m_e_d_i_a learning, technology-enhanced learning (TEL),
computer-based training (CBT), computer-assisted instruction (CAI), internet-
based training (IBT), web-based training (WBT), online education, virtual
education, _v_i_r_t_u_a_l_ _l_e_a_r_n_i_n_g_ _e_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t_s (VLE) which are also called learning
platforms, _m_-_l_e_a_r_n_i_n_g, digital educational collaboration, distributed learning,
computer-mediated communication, cyber-learning, and multi-modal instruction.
Every one of these numerous terms has had its advocates, who point up
particular potential distinctions. In practice, as technology has advanced, the
particular "narrowly defined" aspect that was initially emphasized has blended
into "e-learning." As an example, "virtual learning" in a narrowly-defined
_s_e_m_a_n_t_i_c sense implies entering the environmental simulation within a _v_i_r_t_u_a_l
_w_o_r_l_d,_[_5_]_[_6_] for example in treating _P_T_S_D._[_7_]_[_8_] In practice, a "virtual
education course" refers to any instructional course in which all, or at least
a significant portion, is delivered by the _I_n_t_e_r_n_e_t. "Virtual" is used in that
broader way to describe a course that not taught in a classroom face-to-face
but through a substitute mode that can conceptually be associated "virtually"
with classroom teaching, which means that people do not have to go to the
physical classroom to learn. Accordingly, virtual education refers to a form of
_d_i_s_t_a_n_c_e_ _l_e_a_r_n_i_n_g in which course content is delivered by various methods such
as _c_o_u_r_s_e_ _m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t_ _a_p_p_l_i_c_a_t_i_o_n_s, _m_u_l_t_i_m_e_d_i_a resources, and _v_i_d_e_o_c_o_n_f_e_r_e_n_c_i_n_g.
Students and instructors communicate via these technologies._[_9_]
The worldwide e-learning industry is economically significant, and was
estimated in 2000 to be over $48 billion according to conservative estimates.
_[_1_0_] Developments in internet and multimedia technologies are the basic enabler
of e-learning, with consulting, content, technologies, services and support
being identified as the five key sectors of the e-learning industry._[_1_1_]

experiments. In 1963, Bernard Luskin installed the first computer in a
community college for instruction, working with Stanford and others, developed
computer assisted instruction. Luskin completed his landmark UCLA dissertation
working with the Rand Corporation in analyzing obstacles to computer assisted
instruction in 1970.
Educational institutions began to take advantage of the new medium by offering
distance learning courses using computer networking for information.
Early e-learning systems, based on Computer-Based Learning/Training often
attempted to replicate autocratic teaching styles whereby the role of the e-
learning system was assumed to be for transferring knowledge, as opposed to
systems developed later based on _C_o_m_p_u_t_e_r_ _S_u_p_p_o_r_t_e_d_ _C_o_l_l_a_b_o_r_a_t_i_v_e_ _L_e_a_r_n_i_n_g
(CSCL), which encouraged the shared development of knowledge.

collaborative learning, in addition to data management, has been realized. The
type of computers has changed over the years from cumbersome, slow devices
taking up much space in the classroom, home, and office to laptops and handheld
devices that are more portable in form and size and this minimalization of
technology devices will continue._[_1_7_]

a revolution of using the Internet to deliver learning,_[_1_8_] making heavy use of
web-based training and online distance learning and online discussion between
students._[_1_9_] Practitioners such as Harasim (1995)_[_2_0_] put heavy emphasis on
the use of learning networks.
With the advent of _W_o_r_l_d_ _W_i_d_e_ _W_e_b in the 1990s, teachers embarked on the method
using emerging technologies to employ multi-object oriented sites, which are

By 1994, CALCampus presented its first online curriculum as Internet becoming

schemes of communication; through the invention of _w_e_b_c_a_m_s, educators can
simply record lessons live and upload them on the website page. Now, there are
currently wide varieties of online education that are reachable for colleges,
universities and _K_-_1_2 students. In fact, the _N_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _C_e_n_t_e_r_ _f_o_r_ _E_d_u_c_a_t_i_o_n
_S_t_a_t_i_s_t_i_c_s estimate the number of K-12 students enrolled in online distance
learning programs increased by 65 percent from 2002 to 2005. This form of high
learning allowed for greater flexibility by easing the communication between
teacher and student, now teachers received quick lecture feedbacks from their
students. The idea of Virtual Education soon became popular and many
institutions began following the new norm in the education history.
The emergence of e-learning is arguably[_w_h_o_?] one of the most powerful tools
available to the growing need for education. The need to improve access to
education opportunities allowed students who desire to pursue their education
but are constricted due to the distance of the institution to achieve education
through "virtual connection" newly available to them. Online education is
rapidly increasing and becoming as a viable alternative for traditional
classrooms. According to a 2008 study conducted by the _U_._S_ _D_e_p_a_r_t_m_e_n_t_ _o_f
_E_d_u_c_a_t_i_o_n, back in 2006-2007 academic year, about 66% of postsecondary public

offered some distance learning courses, record shows only 77% of enrollment in
for-credit courses being for those with an online component._[_2_5_] In 2008, the
Council of Europe passed a statement endorsing e-learning's potential to drive
equality and education improvements across the EU._[_2_6_]
Recent studies show that the effectiveness of online instruction is considered
equal to that of face-to-face classroom instructions but not as effective as
the combination of face-to-face and online methods._[_2_5_]

(somewhat inconsistently) to categorize the extent to which technology is used.
For example, 'hybrid learning' or '_b_l_e_n_d_e_d_ _l_e_a_r_n_i_n_g' may refer to classroom
aids and laptops, or may refer to approaches in which traditional classroom
time is reduced but not eliminated, and is replaced with some online learning.
_[_2_9_]_[_3_0_]_[_3_1_] 'Distributed learning' may describe either the e-learning
component of a hybrid approach, or fully online _d_i_s_t_a_n_c_e_ _l_e_a_r_n_i_n_g environments.

occurs in real-time, with all participants interacting at the same time, while
asynchronous learning is self-paced and allows participants to engage in the
exchange of ideas or information without the dependency of other participants
involvement at the same time.
_S_y_n_c_h_r_o_n_o_u_s_ _l_e_a_r_n_i_n_g involves the exchange of ideas and information with one or

an example of synchronous communications. In e-learning environments, examples
of synchronous communications include online real-time live teacher instruction
and feedback, Skype conversations, or chat rooms or virtual classrooms where
everyone is online and working collaboratively at the same time.
_A_s_y_n_c_h_r_o_n_o_u_s_ _l_e_a_r_n_i_n_g may use technologies such as _e_m_a_i_l, _b_l_o_g_s, _w_i_k_i_s, and

_[_3_4_] Asynchronous learning is particularly beneficial for students who have
health problems or have child care responsibilities and regularly leaving the
home to attend lectures is difficult. They have the opportunity to complete
their work in a low stress environment and within a more flexible timeframe.
_[_1_9_] In asynchronous online courses, students proceed at their own pace. If
they need to listen to a lecture a second time, or think about a question for
awhile, they may do so without fearing that they will hold back the rest of the
class. Through online courses, students can earn their diplomas more quickly,
or repeat failed courses without the embarrassment of being in a class with
younger students. Students also have access to an incredible variety of
enrichment courses in online learning, and can participate in college courses,
internships, sports, or work and still graduate with their class.
Both the asynchronous and synchronous methods rely heavily on self-motivation,
self-discipline, and the ability to communicate in writing effectively._[_3_5_]

Computer-based learning or training (CBT) refers to self-paced learning
activities delivered on a _c_o_m_p_u_t_e_r or handheld device such as a tablet or
smartphone. CBT often delivers content via CD-ROM, and typically presents
content in a linear fashion, much like reading an online book or manual. For
this reason, CBT is often used to teach static processes, such as using
software or completing mathematical equations. Computer-based training is
conceptually similar to web-based training (WBT), the primary difference being
that WBTs are delivered via _I_n_t_e_r_n_e_t using a _w_e_b_ _b_r_o_w_s_e_r.
Assessing learning in a CBT is often by assessments that can be easily scored
by a computer such as multiple choice questions, drag-and-drop, radio button,
simulation or other interactive means. Assessments are easily scored and
recorded via online software, providing immediate end-user feedback and
completion status. Users are often able to print completion records in the form
of certificates.
CBTs provide learning stimulus beyond traditional learning methodology from
textbook, manual, or classroom-based instruction. For example, CBTs offer user-
friendly solutions for satisfying continuing education requirements. Instead of
limiting students to attending courses or reading printed manuals, students are
able to acquire knowledge and skills through methods that are much more
conducive to individual learning preferences.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] For example,
CBTs offer visual learning benefits through animation or video, not typically
offered by any other means.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]
CBTs can be a good alternative to printed learning materials since rich media,
including videos or animations, can easily be embedded to enhance the learning.
However, CBTs pose some learning challenges. Typically the creation of
effective CBTs requires enormous resources. The software for developing CBTs
(such as _F_l_a_s_h or _A_d_o_b_e_ _D_i_r_e_c_t_o_r) is often more complex than a subject matter
expert or teacher is able to use. In addition, the lack of human interaction
can limit both the type of content that can be presented as well as the type of
assessment that can be performed. Many learning organizations are beginning to
use smaller CBT/WBT activities as part of a broader online learning program
which may include online discussion or other interactive elements.

designed to encourage or require students to work together on learning tasks.
CSCL is similar in concept to the terminology, "e-learning 2.0".
Collaborative learning is distinguishable from the traditional approach to
instruction in which the instructor is the principal source of knowledge and
skills. For example, the neologism "e-learning 1.0" refers to the direct
transfer method in computer-based learning and training systems (CBL). In
contrast to the linear delivery of content, often directly from the
instructor's material, CSCL uses _b_l_o_g_s, _w_i_k_i_s, and cloud-based document portals
(such as _G_o_o_g_l_e_ _D_o_c_s and _D_r_o_p_b_o_x). With technological _W_e_b_ _2_._0 advances, sharing
information between multiple people in a _n_e_t_w_o_r_k has become much easier and use
has increased._[_3_6_]:1 One of the main reasons for its usage states that it is "a
breeding ground for creative and engaging educational endeavors."_[_3_6_]:2
Using _W_e_b_ _2_._0 social tools in the classroom allows for students and teachers to
work collaboratively, discuss ideas, and promote information. According to
Sendall (2008),_[_3_7_] blogs, wikis, and social networking skills are found to be
significantly useful in the classroom. After initial instruction on using the
tools, students also reported an increase in knowledge and comfort level for
using Web 2.0 tools. The collaborative tools also prepare students with
technology skills necessary in today's workforce.
_L_o_c_u_s_ _o_f_ _c_o_n_t_r_o_l remains an important consideration in successful engagement of
e-learners. According to the work of Cassandra B. Whyte, the continuing
attention to aspects of motivation and success in regard to e-learning should
be kept in context and concert with other educational efforts. Information
about motivational tendencies can help educators, psychologists, and
technologists develop insights to help students perform better academically.

Videos allow teachers to reach students who are visual learners and tend to
learn best by seeing the material rather than hearing or reading about it.
Teachers can access video clips through the internet instead of relying on DVDs
or VHS tapes. Websites like YouTube are used by many teachers. Teachers can use
messaging programs such as Skype, Adobe Connect, or webcams, to interact with
guest speakers and other experts. Interactive video games are being integrated
in the curriculum at both K-12 and higher education institutions.
Research on the use of video in lessons is preliminary, but early results show
an increased retention and better results when video is used in a lesson.

_S_c_r_e_e_n_c_a_s_t_i_n_g is a recent trend in e-learning. There are many screencasting
tools available that allow users to share their screens directly from their
browser and make the video available online so that the viewers can stream the
video directly._[_5_4_] The advantage of such tools is that it gives the presenter
the ability to show his ideas and flow of thoughts rather than simply explain
them, which may be more confusing when delivered via simple text instructions.
With the combination of video and audio, the expert can mimic the one-on-one
experience of the classroom and deliver clear, complete instructions. From the
learner's point of view this provides the ability to pause and rewind and gives
the learners the advantage of moving at their own pace, something a classroom
cannot always offer.

the 1980s. It is also broader than the terms Online Learning or Online
Education which generally refer to purely web-based learning. In cases where
mobile technologies are used, the term _M_-_l_e_a_r_n_i_n_g has become more common. E-
learning, however, also has implications beyond just the technology and refers
to the actual learning that takes place using these systems.

_d_e_g_r_e_e and certificate programs via the Internet at a wide range of levels and
in a wide range of disciplines. While some programs require students to attend
some _c_a_m_p_u_s classes or orientations, many are delivered completely online. In
addition, several universities offer online student support services, such as
online advising and registration, e-counseling, online textbook purchases,

virtual classrooms and meetings which often use a mix of communication
technologies. One example of web conferencing software that enables students
and instructors to communicate with each other via webcam, microphone, and
real-time chatting in a group setting, is Adobe Connect, which is sometimes
used for meetings and presentations._[_5_5_] Participants in a virtual classroom
can also use icons called emoticons to communicate feelings and responses to
questions or statements. Students are able to 'write on the board' and even
share their desktop, when given rights by the teacher. Other communication
technologies available in a virtual classroom include text notes, microphone
rights, and breakout sessions. Breakout sessions allow the participants to work
collaboratively in a small group setting to accomplish a task as well as allow
the teacher to have private conversations with his or her students.
The virtual classroom also provides the opportunity for students to receive
direct instruction from a qualified teacher in an interactive environment.
Students have direct and immediate access to their instructor for instant
feedback and direction. The virtual classroom also provides a structured
schedule of classes, which can be helpful for students who may find the freedom
of asynchronous learning to be overwhelming. In addition, the virtual classroom
provides a social learning environment that replicates the traditional "brick
and mortar" classroom. Most virtual classroom applications provide a recording
feature. Each class is recorded and stored on a server, which allows for
instant playback of any class over the course of the school year. This can be
extremely useful for students to review material and concepts for an upcoming
exam. This also provides students with the opportunity to watch any class that
they may have missed, so that they do not fall behind. It also gives parents
the ability to monitor any classroom to ensure that they are satisfied with the
education their child is receiving.

software for distributing courses over the Internet and offering features for
online collaboration. The creation and maintenance of comprehensive learning

"Online Formative Assessment". This involves making an initial formative
assessment by sifting out the incorrect answers. The author of the assessment/
teacher will then explain what the pupil should have done with each question.
It will then give the pupil at least one practice at each slight variation of
sifted out questions. This is the formative learning stage. The next stage is
to make a _s_u_m_m_a_t_i_v_e_ _a_s_s_e_s_s_m_e_n_t by a new set of questions only covering the

An Electronic Performance Support System is, according to Barry Raybould, "a
computer-based system that improves worker productivity by providing on-the-job
access to integrated information, advice, and learning experiences" (Raybould,
1991)._[_6_0_] Gloria Gery defines it as "an integrated electronic environment that
is available to and easily accessible by each employee and is structured to
provide immediate, individualized on-line access to the full range of
information, software, guidance, advice and assistance, data, images, tools,
and assessment and monitoring systems to permit job performance with minimal
support and intervention by others." (Gery, 1989)._[_6_1_]
Electronic performance support systems are used for:
    * task structuring support: help with how to do a task (procedures and
      processes),
    * access to knowledge bases (help user find information needed)
    * alternate forms of knowledge representation (multiple representations of

    * Procedure - step-by-step task (e. g., entering a formula into a
      spreadsheet, or the steps that should be followed within a phase in
      ADDIE)

of _l_e_a_r_n_i_n_g_ _o_b_j_e_c_t_s, or for categorizing metadata (_L_O_M). These standards
themselves are early in the maturity process with the oldest being 8 years old.
They are also relatively vertical specific: SIF is primarily pK-12, LOM is
primarily Corp, Military and Higher Ed, and SCORM is primarily Military and
Corp with some Higher Ed. PESC- the Post-Secondary Education Standards Council-
is also making headway in developing standards and learning objects for the
Higher Ed space, while SIF is beginning to seriously turn towards Instructional
and Curriculum learning objects.
In the US pK12 space there are a host of content standards that are critical as
well- the NCES data standards are a prime example. Each state government's
content standards and achievement benchmarks are critical metadata for linking
e-learning objects in that space.
An excellent example of e-learning that relates to knowledge management and
reusability is Navy E-Learning, which is available to Active Duty, Retired, or
Disable Military members. This on-line tool provides certificate courses to
enrich the user in various subjects related to military training and civilian
skill sets. The e-learning system not only provides learning objectives, but
also evaluates the progress of the student and credit can be earned toward
higher learning institutions. The Internet allows for learning to be directed
at one‚Äôs current objectives._[_7_2_] This reuse is an excellent example of
knowledge retention and the cyclical process of knowledge transfer and use of
data and records.

Various forms of electronic media are a feature of preschool life._[_7_3_] Although
parents report a positive experience, the impact of such use has not been
systematically assessed._[_7_3_]
The age when a given child might start using a particular technology such as a
cellphone or computer might depend on matching a technological resource to the
recipient's developmental capabilities, such as the age-anticipated stages
labeled by Swiss psychologist, _J_e_a_n_ _P_i_a_g_e_t._[_7_4_] Parameters, such as age-
appropriateness, coherence with sought-after values, and concurrent

E-learning is utilized by public _K_‚_Ä_ì_1_2 schools in the United States as well as
private schools. Some e-learning environments take place in a traditional
classroom, others allow students to attend classes from home or other
locations. There are several states that are utilizing virtual school platforms
for e-learning across the country that continue to increase. _V_i_r_t_u_a_l_ _s_c_h_o_o_l

courses anywhere there is an internet connection. Technology kits are usually
provided that include computers, printers, and reimbursement for home internet
use. Students are to use technology for school use only and must meet weekly
work submission requirements. Teachers employed by K‚Äì12 online public schools
must be certified teachers in the state they are teaching in. Online schools
allow for students to maintain their own pacing and progress, course selection,
and provide the flexibility for students to create their own schedule.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n

E-learning is increasingly being utilized by students who may not want to go to
traditional brick and mortar schools due to severe allergies or other medical
issues, fear of _s_c_h_o_o_l_ _v_i_o_l_e_n_c_e and _s_c_h_o_o_l_ _b_u_l_l_y_i_n_g and students whose parents
would like to homeschool but do not feel qualified._[_7_6_] Online schools create a
safe haven for students to receive a quality education while almost completely
avoiding these common problems. Online charter schools also often are not
limited by location, income level or class size in the way brick and mortar
charter schools are._[_7_7_]
National private schools are also available online. These provide the benefits
of e-learning to students in states where charter online schools are not
available. They also may allow students greater flexibility and exemption from
state testing.

In the _U_n_i_t_e_d_ _S_t_a_t_e_s, e-learning has become a predominant form of post-
secondary education.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] Enrollments for fully online learning
increased by an average of 12‚Äì14 percent annually between 2004‚Äì2009,
compared with an average of approximately 2 per cent increase per year in
enrollments overall._[_7_9_]_[_8_0_] In 2006, 3.5 million students participated in on-
line learning at higher education institutions in the United States._[_8_1_] Almost
a quarter of all students in post-secondary education were taking fully online
courses in 2008._[_7_9_] In 2009, 44 percent of post-secondary students in the USA
were taking some or all of their courses online, this figure is projected to
rise to 81 percent by 2014._[_8_2_] During the fall 2011 term, 6.7 million students
enrolled in at least one online course._[_8_3_] Over two-thirds of chief academic
officers believe that online learning is critical for their institution._[_8_4_]
The Sloan report, based on a poll of academic leaders, indicated that students
are as satisfied with on-line classes as with traditional ones.
Although a large proportion of _f_o_r_-_p_r_o_f_i_t higher education institutions now
offer online classes, only about half of private, _n_o_n_-_p_r_o_f_i_t schools do so.
Private institutions may become more involved with on-line presentations as the
costs decrease. Properly trained staff must also be hired to work with students
online. These staff members need to understand the content area, and also be
highly trained in the use of the computer and Internet. Online education is
rapidly increasing, and online _d_o_c_t_o_r_a_l_ _p_r_o_g_r_a_m_s have even developed at leading

There are several advantages and disadvantages with regards to motivation in e-
learning. 
For many students, e-learning is the most convenient way to pursue a degree in
higher education. A lot of these students are attracted to a flexible, self-
paced method of education to attain their degree. It is important to note that
many of these students could be working their way through college, supporting
themselves or battling with serious illness._[_8_9_] To these students, it would be
extremely difficult to find time to fit college in their schedule. Thus, these
students are more likely and more motivated to enroll in an e-learning class.
Moreover, in asynchronous e-learning classes, students are free to log on and
complete work any time they wish. They can work on and complete their
assignments at the times when they think most cogently, whether it be early in
the morning or late at night._[_9_0_]
However, many teachers have a harder time keeping their students engaged in an
e-learning class. A disengaged student is usually an unmotivated student, and
an engaged student is a motivated student._[_9_1_] One reason why students are more
likely to be disengaged is that the lack of face-to-face contact makes it
difficult for teachers to read their students' nonverbal cues,_[_9_0_] including
confusion, boredom or frustration. These cues are helpful to a teacher in
deciding whether to speed up, introduce new material, slow down or explain a
concept in a different way. If a student is confused, bored or frustrated, he
or she is unlikely to be motivated to succeed in that class.
