relation to a curriculum, which itself is established according to a
predetermined purpose of the schools in the system. Schools systems are
sometimes also based on religions, giving them different curricula.

The term preschool refers to a school for children who are not old enough to
attend kindergarten. It is a nursery school.
Preschool education is important because it can give a child the edge in a
competitive world and education climate.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] While children who do
not receive the fundamentals during their preschool years will be taught the
alphabet, counting, shapes and colors and designs when they begin their formal
education they will be behind the children who already possess that _k_n_o_w_l_e_d_g_e.
The true purpose behind kindergarten is "to provide a child-centered, preschool
curriculum for three to seven year old children that aimed at unfolding the
child's physical, intellectual, and moral nature with balanced emphasis on each
of them."_[_7_]

Primary school in open air. Teacher (priest) with class from the outskirts of
_B_u_c_h_a_r_e_s_t, around 1842.
Primary (or elementary) education consists of the first 5‚Äì7 years of formal,
structured education. In general, primary education consists of six or eight
years of schooling starting at the age of five or six, although this varies
between, and sometimes within, countries. Globally, around 89% of primary-age
children are enrolled in primary education, and this proportion is rising._[_8_]
Under the _E_d_u_c_a_t_i_o_n_ _F_o_r_ _A_l_l programs driven by _U_N_E_S_C_O, most countries have
committed to achieving universal enrollment in primary education by 2015, and
in many countries, it is compulsory for children to receive primary education.
The division between primary and _s_e_c_o_n_d_a_r_y_ _e_d_u_c_a_t_i_o_n is somewhat arbitrary, but
it generally occurs at about eleven or twelve years of age. Some education
systems have separate _m_i_d_d_l_e_ _s_c_h_o_o_l_s, with the transition to the final stage of
secondary education taking place at around the age of fourteen. Schools that
provide primary education, are mostly referred to as primary schools. Primary
schools in these countries are often subdivided into _i_n_f_a_n_t_ _s_c_h_o_o_l_s and _j_u_n_i_o_r

In India, compulsory education spans over twelve years, out of which children
receive elementary education for 8 years. Elementary schooling consists of five
years of primary schooling and 3 years of upper primary schooling. Various

In most contemporary educational systems of the world, secondary education
comprises the formal education that occurs during _a_d_o_l_e_s_c_e_n_c_e. It is
characterized by transition from the typically compulsory, comprehensive
_p_r_i_m_a_r_y_ _e_d_u_c_a_t_i_o_n for _m_i_n_o_r_s, to the optional, selective _t_e_r_t_i_a_r_y, "post-
secondary", or "_h_i_g_h_e_r" education (e.g. _u_n_i_v_e_r_s_i_t_y, vocational school) for
_a_d_u_l_t_s. Depending on the system, schools for this period, or a part of it, may
be called secondary or _h_i_g_h_ _s_c_h_o_o_l_s, _g_y_m_n_a_s_i_u_m_s, _l_y_c_e_u_m_s, middle schools,
_c_o_l_l_e_g_e_s, or vocational schools. The exact meaning of any of these terms varies
from one system to another. The exact boundary between primary and secondary
education also varies from country to country and even within them, but is
generally around the seventh to the tenth year of schooling. Secondary
education occurs mainly during the teenage years. In the United States, Canada
and _A_u_s_t_r_a_l_i_a primary and secondary education together are sometimes referred
to as _K_-_1_2 education, and in New Zealand Year 1‚Äì13 is used. The purpose of
secondary education can be to give _c_o_m_m_o_n_ _k_n_o_w_l_e_d_g_e, to prepare for _h_i_g_h_e_r
_e_d_u_c_a_t_i_o_n or to train directly in a _p_r_o_f_e_s_s_i_o_n.
The emergence of secondary education in the United States did not happen until
1910, caused by the rise in big businesses and technological advances in
factories (for instance, the emergence of electrification), that required
_s_k_i_l_l_e_d_ _w_o_r_k_e_r_s. In order to meet this new job demand, _h_i_g_h_ _s_c_h_o_o_l_s were
created, with a curriculum focused on practical job skills that would better
prepare students for _w_h_i_t_e_ _c_o_l_l_a_r or skilled _b_l_u_e_ _c_o_l_l_a_r work. This proved to
be beneficial for both employers and employees, for the improvement in human
capital caused employees to become more efficient, which lowered costs for the
employer, and skilled employees received a higher wage than employees with just
primary educational attainment.
In Europe, grammar schools or academies date from as early as the 16th century,
in the form of _p_u_b_l_i_c_ _s_c_h_o_o_l_s, _f_e_e_-_p_a_y_i_n_g_ _s_c_h_o_o_l_s, or charitable educational
foundations, which themselves have an even longer history.

In the past, those who were disabled were often not eligible for public
education. Children with disabilities were often educated by physicians or
special tutors. These early physicians (people like _I_t_a_r_d, _S_e_g_u_i_n, _H_o_w_e,
_G_a_l_l_a_u_d_e_t) set the foundation for special education today. They focused on
individualized instruction and functional skills. Special education was only
provided to people with severe disabilities in its early years, but more
recently it has been opened to anyone who has experienced difficulty learning.

An anarchistic free school (also anarchist free school and free school) is a
decentralized network in which skills, information, and knowledge are shared
without hierarchy or the institutional environment of formal schooling. Free
school students may be adults, children, or both. This organisational structure
is distinct from ones used by democratic free schools which permit children's
individual initiatives and learning endeavors within the context of a school
democracy, and from free education where 'traditional' schooling is made
available to pupils without charge. The open structure of free schools is
intended to encourage self-reliance, critical consciousness, and personal
development. Free schools often operate outside the _m_a_r_k_e_t_ _e_c_o_n_o_m_y in favor of
a _g_i_f_t_ _e_c_o_n_o_m_y.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] Nevertheless, the meaning of the "free" of
free schools is not restricted to monetary cost, and can refer to an emphasis
on free speech and student-centred education.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]

Alternatives of the latter type are often the result of _e_d_u_c_a_t_i_o_n_ _r_e_f_o_r_m and

Autodidacticism (also autodidactism) is self-directed learning that is related
to but different from _i_n_f_o_r_m_a_l_ _l_e_a_r_n_i_n_g. In a sense, autodidacticism is
"learning on your own" or "by yourself", and an autodidact is a self-teacher.
Autodidacticism is a contemplative, absorbing process. Some autodidacts spend a
great deal of time reviewing the resources of libraries and educational
websites. One may become an autodidact at nearly any point in one's life. While
some may have been informed in a conventional manner in a particular field,

a post-colonial context, the growing recognition and use of indigenous
education methods can be a response to the erosion and loss of indigenous
knowledge and language through the processes of colonialism. Furthermore, it
can enable indigenous communities to "reclaim and revalue their languages and

Education through recreation can be physical, mental, or both. Here, a boy
attempts to make an arched bridge using slightly tapered blocks. This
construction challenge was one of many hands-on activities offered at a
"Discovery Days" festival held by _B_i_g_ _B_r_o_t_h_e_r_ _M_o_u_s_e, a literacy project.
Although his first attempt was a bit weak, half an hour later the boy had made
a solid bridge.
The concept of education through recreation was first applied to childhood
development in the 19th century._[_1_2_] In the early 20th century, the concept was
broadened to include young adults but the emphasis was on physical activities.
_[_1_3_] Educationalist Lawrence _L_._P_._ _J_a_c_k_s, who was also an early proponent of
lifelong learning, best described the modern concept of education through
recreation in the following quotation "A master in the art of living draws no
sharp distinction between his work and his play, his labour and his leisure,
his mind and his body, his education and his recreation. He hardly knows which
is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever he is
doing and leaves others to determine whether he is working or playing. To
himself he always seems to be doing both. Enough for him that he does it well."
(Jacks, 1932)._[_1_4_] Education through recreation is the opportunity to learn in
a seamless fashion through all of life's activities._[_1_5_] The concept has been
revived by the _U_n_i_v_e_r_s_i_t_y_ _o_f_ _W_e_s_t_e_r_n_ _O_n_t_a_r_i_o to teach _a_n_a_t_o_m_y to medical

Higher education, also called tertiary, third stage, or post secondary
education, is the non-compulsory educational level that follows the completion
of a school providing a secondary education, such as a high school or _s_e_c_o_n_d_a_r_y
_s_c_h_o_o_l. Tertiary education is normally taken to include _u_n_d_e_r_g_r_a_d_u_a_t_e and

and universities are the main institutions that provide tertiary education.
Collectively, these are sometimes known as tertiary institutions. Tertiary
education generally results in the receipt of _c_e_r_t_i_f_i_c_a_t_e_s, _d_i_p_l_o_m_a_s, or
_a_c_a_d_e_m_i_c_ _d_e_g_r_e_e_s.
Higher education generally involves work towards a degree-level or _f_o_u_n_d_a_t_i_o_n
_d_e_g_r_e_e qualification. In most developed countries a high proportion of the
population (up to 50%) now enter higher education at some time in their lives.
Higher education is therefore very important to national _e_c_o_n_o_m_i_e_s, both as a
significant industry in its own right, and as a source of trained and educated
personnel for the rest of the economy.

form of education, for many reasons such as its efficiency and results compared
to traditional methods._[_1_7_] Cost of education has been an issue throughout
history, and a major political issue in most countries today. Open education is
generally significantly cheaper than traditional campus based learning and in
many cases even free. Many large university institutions are now starting to
offer free or almost free full courses such as Harvard, MIT and Berkeley
teaming up to form _e_d_X Other universities offering open education are Stanford,
Princeton, Duke, Johns Hopkins, Edinburgh, U.Penn, U. Michigan, U. Virginia, U.
Washington, Caltech. It has been called the biggest change in the way we learn
since the printing press._[_1_8_] Many people despite favorable studies on
effectiveness may still desire to choose traditional campus education for
social and cultural reasons._[_1_9_]
The conventional merit system degree is currently not as common in open
education as it is in campus universities. Although some open universities do
already offer conventional degrees such as the _O_p_e_n_ _U_n_i_v_e_r_s_i_t_y in the _U_n_i_t_e_d

One of the most substantial uses in education is the use of technology. Also
technology is an increasingly influential factor in education. Computers and
mobile phones are used in developed countries both to complement established
education practices and develop new ways of learning such as _o_n_l_i_n_e_ _e_d_u_c_a_t_i_o_n
(a type of _d_i_s_t_a_n_c_e_ _e_d_u_c_a_t_i_o_n). This gives students the opportunity to choose
what they are interested in learning. The proliferation of computers also means
the increase of programming and blogging. Technology offers powerful learning
tools that demand new skills and understandings of students, including
_M_u_l_t_i_m_e_d_i_a, and provides new ways to engage students, such as _V_i_r_t_u_a_l_ _l_e_a_r_n_i_n_g
_e_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t_s. One such tool is a _v_i_r_t_u_a_l_ _m_a_n_i_p_u_l_a_t_i_v_e, which is an
"interactive, Web-based visual representation of a dynamic object that presents
opportunities for constructing mathematical knowledge" (Moyer, Bolyard, &
Spikell, 2002). In short, virtual manipulatives are dynamic visual/pictorial
replicas of physical mathematical manipulatives, which have long been used to
demonstrate and teach various mathematical concepts. Virtual manipulatives can
be easily accessed on the Internet as stand-alone applets, allowing for easy
access and use in a variety of educational settings. Emerging research into the
effectiveness of virtual manipulatives as a teaching tool have yielded
promising results, suggesting comparable, and in many cases superior overall
concept-teaching effectiveness compared to standard teaching methods.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n
_n_e_e_d_e_d] Technology is being used more not only in administrative duties in
education but also in the instruction of students. The use of technologies such
as _P_o_w_e_r_P_o_i_n_t and _i_n_t_e_r_a_c_t_i_v_e_ _w_h_i_t_e_b_o_a_r_d is capturing the attention of students

Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are a "diverse set of tools
and resources used to communicate, create, disseminate, store, and manage
information."_[_2_4_] These technologies include computers, the Internet,
broadcasting technologies (radio and television), and telephony. There is
increasing interest in how computers and the Internet can improve education at
all levels, in both formal and non-formal settings._[_2_5_] Older ICT technologies,
such as radio and television, have for over forty years been used for open and
distance learning, although print remains the cheapest, most accessible and
therefore most dominant delivery mechanism in both developed and developing
countries._[_2_6_] In addition to classroom application and growth of e-learning
opportunities for knowledge attainment, educators involved in student affairs
programming have recognized the increasing importance of computer usage with
data generation for and about students. Motivation and retention counselors,
along with faculty and administrators, can impact the potential academic
success of students by provision of technology based experiences in the
University setting._[_2_7_]
The use of computers and the Internet is in its infancy in developing
countries, if these are used at all, due to limited infrastructure and the
attendant high costs of access. Usually, various technologies are used in
combination rather than as the sole delivery mechanism. For example, the
Kothmale Community Radio Internet uses both radio broadcasts and computer and
Internet technologies to facilitate the sharing of information and provide
educational opportunities in a rural community in Sri Lanka._[_2_8_] The Open
University of the United Kingdom (UKOU), established in 1969 as the first
educational institution in the world wholly dedicated to open and distance
learning, still relies heavily on print-based materials supplemented by radio,
television and, in recent years, online programming._[_2_9_] Similarly, the Indira
Gandhi National Open University in India combines the use of print, recorded
audio and video, broadcast radio and television, and audio conferencing
technologies._[_3_0_]
The term "computer-assisted learning" (CAL) has been increasingly used to
describe the use of technology in teaching. Classrooms of the 21st century
contain interactive white boards, _t_a_b_l_e_t_s, _m_p_3_ _p_l_a_y_e_r_s, laptops, etc. _W_i_k_i

to understand communication and collaboration efforts of group work through
electronic means.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] Teachers are encouraged to embed these
technological devices and services in the curriculum in order to enhance

_S_o_r_t_e_r_[_3_4_] focused on understanding how people's personality affects the way

each other within the learning environment. The work of _D_a_v_i_d_ _K_o_l_b and _A_n_t_h_o_n_y
_G_r_e_g_o_r_c's Type Delineator_[_3_5_] follows a similar but more simplified approach.
It is currently fashionable to divide education into different learning
"modes". The learning modalities_[_3_6_] are probably the most common:
    * _V_i_s_u_a_l: learning based on observation and seeing what is being learned.
    * _A_u_d_i_t_o_r_y: learning based on listening to instructions/information.
    * _K_i_n_e_s_t_h_e_t_i_c: learning based on hands-on work and engaging in activities.
Although it is claimed that, depending on their preferred learning modality,
different teaching techniques have different levels of effectiveness,_[_3_7_]
recent research has argued "there is no adequate evidence base to justify
incorporating learning styles assessments into general educational practice."
_[_3_8_]
A consequence of this theory is that effective teaching should present a
variety of teaching methods which cover all three learning modalities so that
different students have equal opportunities to learn in a way that is effective
for them._[_3_9_] Guy Claxton has questioned the extent that _l_e_a_r_n_i_n_g_ _s_t_y_l_e_s such

Instruction is the facilitation of another's learning. Instructors in primary

education of _s_t_u_d_e_n_t_s and might draw on many _s_u_b_j_e_c_t_s like _r_e_a_d_i_n_g, _w_r_i_t_i_n_g,

institution; and they primarily teach only their specific discipline. Studies
from the United States suggest that the quality of teachers is the single most
important factor affecting student performance, and that countries which score
highly on international tests have multiple policies in place to ensure that
the teachers they employ are as effective as possible._[_4_2_]_[_4_3_] With the passing
of NCLB in the United States (No Child Left Behind), teachers must be highly
qualified. A popular way to gauge teaching performance is to use student
evaluations of teachers (SETS), but these evaluations have been criticized for
being counterproductive to learning and inaccurate due to student bias._[_4_4_]

hypotheses that have been verified by observation and experiment."_[_4_6_] A
descriptive theory of education can be thought of as a conceptual scheme that

knowledgeable managers and engineers who are able to operate new machines or

function of its stock of "_h_u_m_a_n_ _c_a_p_i_t_a_l". Recent study of the determinants of

1770". Education as a science cannot be separated from the educational
traditions that existed before. Adults trained the young of their society in
the knowledge and skills they would need to master and eventually pass on. The
evolution of culture, and human beings as a species depended on this practice
of transmitting knowledge. In pre-literate societies this was achieved orally
and through imitation. Story-telling continued from one generation to the next.
Oral language developed into written symbols and letters. The depth and breadth
of knowledge that could be preserved and passed soon increased exponentially.
When cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond the basic skills of
communicating, trading, gathering food, religious practices, etc., formal
education, and schooling, eventually followed. Schooling in this sense was
already in place in Egypt between 3000 and 500BC.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]

As an academic field, philosophy of education is "the philosophical study of
education and its problems ... its central subject matter is education, and its
methods are those of _p_h_i_l_o_s_o_p_h_y"._[_6_1_] "The philosophy of education may be
either the philosophy of the process of education or the philosophy of the
discipline of education. That is, it may be part of the discipline in the sense
of being concerned with the aims, forms, methods, or results of the process of
educating or being educated; or it may be metadisciplinary in the sense of
being concerned with the concepts, aims, and methods of the discipline."_[_6_2_] As
such, it is both part of the field of education and a field of _a_p_p_l_i_e_d
_p_h_i_l_o_s_o_p_h_y, drawing from fields of _m_e_t_a_p_h_y_s_i_c_s, _e_p_i_s_t_e_m_o_l_o_g_y, _a_x_i_o_l_o_g_y and the

concerned with the processes of educational attainment in the general

specific _d_i_s_a_b_i_l_i_t_i_e_s.
Educational psychology can in part be understood through its relationship with
other disciplines. It is informed primarily by _p_s_y_c_h_o_l_o_g_y, bearing a
relationship to that discipline analogous to the relationship between _m_e_d_i_c_i_n_e

and _c_l_a_s_s_r_o_o_m_ _m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t. Educational psychology both draws from and

motivated by aspirations for progress and betterment. Learners can also be
motivated by their interest in the subject area or specific skill they are

management may have an important spill-over effect on the system as a whole.
_[_7_0_] Sustainable capacity development requires complex interventions at the
institutional, organizational and individual levels that could be based on some
foundational principles:
    * national leadership and ownership should be the touchstone of any
      intervention;
    * strategies must be context relevant and context specific;[_c_l_a_r_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n

    * partners should commit to a long-term investment in capacity development,
      while working towards some short-term achievements;
    * outside intervention should be conditional on an impact assessment of
      national capacities at various levels.
    * Removal of a certain percentage of students for improvisation of

Education is becoming increasingly international. The most represented case is
the spread of mass schooling. Mass schooling has implanted the fundamental
concepts that everyone has a right to be educated regardless of his/her
cultural background and gender differences. The system has also promoted the
global rules and norms of how the school should operate and what is education.
_[_7_4_] Though the system can have variations in local, regional, and country
level, the similarities ‚Äî in systems or even in ideas ‚Äî that schools share
also enable the exchange among students at all levels which are also playing an
increasingly important role in globalization process. In Europe, for example,
the Socrates-_E_r_a_s_m_u_s Program_[_7_5_] stimulates exchanges across European
universities. Also, the _S_o_r_o_s_ _F_o_u_n_d_a_t_i_o_n_[_7_6_] provides many opportunities for
students from central Asia and eastern Europe. Programs such as the

education. Some scholars argue that, regardless of whether one system is
considered better or worse than another, experiencing a different way of
education can often be considered to be the most important, enriching element
of an international learning experience._[_7_7_] The _g_l_o_b_a_l_ _c_a_m_p_u_s online, led by
