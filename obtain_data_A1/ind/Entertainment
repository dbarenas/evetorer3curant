EEnntteerrttaaiinnmmeenntt is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an
_a_u_d_i_e_n_c_e, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is
more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over
thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's
attention._[_1_] Although people's attention is held by different things, because
individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are
recognisable and familiar. _S_t_o_r_y_t_e_l_l_i_n_g, _m_u_s_i_c, _d_r_a_m_a, _d_a_n_c_e, and different
kinds of _p_e_r_f_o_r_m_a_n_c_e exist in all cultures, were supported in _r_o_y_a_l_ _c_o_u_r_t_s,
developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all
citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an _e_n_t_e_r_t_a_i_n_m_e_n_t
_i_n_d_u_s_t_r_y which records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves
and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a
private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a
_b_a_n_q_u_e_t adapted for two; to any size or type of _p_a_r_t_y, with appropriate music
and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global
audience.
The experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with
amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is _f_u_n and laughter,
although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in
the various forms of _c_e_r_e_m_o_n_y, celebration, _r_e_l_i_g_i_o_u_s_ _f_e_s_t_i_v_a_l, or _s_a_t_i_r_e for
example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may
also be a means of achieving _i_n_s_i_g_h_t or intellectual growth.
An important aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private
_r_e_c_r_e_a_t_i_o_n or _l_e_i_s_u_r_e activity into entertainment. The audience may have a
passive role, as in the case of persons watching a _p_l_a_y, _o_p_e_r_a, _t_e_l_e_v_i_s_i_o_n
_s_h_o_w, or _f_i_l_m; or the audience role may be active, as in the case of _g_a_m_e_s,
where the participant/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment
can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the
case of _t_h_e_a_t_r_e or _c_o_n_c_e_r_t_s; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of
_c_h_i_l_d_r_e_n_'_s_ _g_a_m_e_s. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many
centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion. Films
and _v_i_d_e_o_ _g_a_m_e_s, for example, although they use newer media, continue to _t_e_l_l
_s_t_o_r_i_e_s, present drama, and play music. _F_e_s_t_i_v_a_l_s devoted to _m_u_s_i_c, _f_i_l_m, or
_d_a_n_c_e allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.
Some activities that once were considered entertaining, particularly public
punishments, have been removed from the public arena. Others, such as _f_e_n_c_i_n_g
or _a_r_c_h_e_r_y, once necessary skills for some, have become serious _s_p_o_r_t_s and even
_p_r_o_f_e_s_s_i_o_n_s for the participants, at the same time developing into
entertainment with wider appeal for bigger audiences. In the same way, other
necessary skills, such as _c_o_o_k_i_n_g, have developed into performances among
professionals, staged as global competitions and then broadcast for
entertainment. What is entertainment for one group or individual may be
regarded as work by another.
The familiar forms of entertainment have the capacity to cross over different
media and have demonstrated a seemingly unlimited potential for creative _r_e_m_i_x.
This has ensured the continuity and longevity of many themes, images, and
structures.

Entertainment can be distinguished from other activities such as _e_d_u_c_a_t_i_o_n and
_m_a_r_k_e_t_i_n_g even though they have learned how to use the appeal of entertainment
to achieve their different goals. The importance and impact of entertainment is
recognised by scholars_[_2_]_[_3_] and its increasing sophistication has influenced
practices in other fields such as _m_u_s_e_o_l_o_g_y._[_4_]_[_5_]
Psychologists say the function of media entertainment is "the attainment of
_g_r_a_t_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n"._[_6_] No other results or measurable benefit are usually expected
from it (except perhaps the final score in a sporting entertainment). This is
in contrast to education (which is designed with the purpose of developing
understanding or helping people to learn) and marketing (which aims to
encourage people to purchase commercial products). However, the distinctions
become blurred when education seeks to be more "entertaining" and entertainment
or marketing seek to be more "educational". Such mixtures are often known by
the _n_e_o_l_o_g_i_s_m_s "_e_d_u_t_a_i_n_m_e_n_t" or "_i_n_f_o_t_a_i_n_m_e_n_t". The psychology of entertainment
as well as of learning has been applied to all these fields._[_7_] Some education-
entertainment is a serious attempt to combine the best features of the two._[_8_]
_[_9_]
An entertainment might go beyond gratification and produce some insight in its
audience when it skilfully considers universal philosophical questions such as:
"What is the meaning of life?"; "What does it mean to be human?"; "What is the
right thing to do?"; or "How do I know what I know?". Questions such as these
drive many narratives and dramas, whether they are presented in the form of a
story, film, play, poem, book, dance, comic, or game. Dramatic examples include
_S_h_a_k_e_s_p_e_a_r_e's influential play _H_a_m_l_e_t, whose hero articulates these concerns in
_p_o_e_t_r_y; and films, such as _T_h_e_ _M_a_t_r_i_x, which explores the nature of knowledge.
_[_1_0_] _N_o_v_e_l_s give great scope for investigating these themes while they
entertain their readers._[_1_1_] An example of a creative work that considers
philosophical questions so entertainingly that it has been presented in a very
wide range of forms is _T_h_e_ _H_i_t_c_h_h_i_k_e_r_'_s_ _G_u_i_d_e_ _t_o_ _t_h_e_ _G_a_l_a_x_y. Originally a _r_a_d_i_o
_c_o_m_e_d_y, this story became so popular that it has also appeared as a novel,
film, television series, stage show, comic, _a_u_d_i_o_b_o_o_k, _L_P_ _r_e_c_o_r_d, _a_d_v_e_n_t_u_r_e
_g_a_m_e and _o_n_l_i_n_e_ _g_a_m_e and has been translated into many languages._[_1_2_] Its
themes encompass the _m_e_a_n_i_n_g_ _o_f_ _l_i_f_e, as well as "the _e_t_h_i_c_s of entertainment,

Telling stories around a campfire is a universal entertainment

The "ancient craft of communicating events and experiences, using words,
images, sounds and gestures" by telling a story_[_1_4_] is not only the means by
which people passed on their cultural values and traditions and history from
one generation to another, it has been an important part of most forms of
entertainment ever since the earliest times. Stories are still told in the
early forms, for example, around a fire while _c_a_m_p_i_n_g, or when listening to the
stories of another culture as a _t_o_u_r_i_s_t. "The earliest storytelling sequences
we possess, now of course, committed to writing, were undoubtedly originally a
speaking from mouth to ear and their force as entertainment derived from the
very same elements we today enjoy in films and novels."_[_1_5_] Storytelling is an
activity that has evolved and developed "toward variety"._[_1_5_] Many
entertainments, including storytelling but especially music and drama, remain
familiar but have developed into a wide variety of form to suit a very wide
range of personal preferences and cultural expression. Many types are blended
or supported by other forms. For example, drama, stories and banqueting (or
dining) are commonly enhanced by music; sport and _g_a_m_e_s are incorporated into
other activities to increase appeal. Some may have evolved from serious or
necessary activities (such as _r_u_n_n_i_n_g and _j_u_m_p_i_n_g) into competition and then
become entertainment. It is said, for example, that _p_o_l_e_ _v_a_u_l_t_i_n_g "may have
originated in the Netherlands, where people used long poles to vault over wide
canals rather than wear out their clogs walking miles to the nearest bridge.
Others maintain that pole vaulting was used in warfare to vault over fortress
walls during battle."_[_1_6_] The equipment for such sports has become increasingly
sophisticated. Vaulting poles, for example, were originally made from woods
such as _a_s_h, _h_i_c_k_o_r_y or _h_a_z_e_l; in the 19th century _b_a_m_b_o_o was used and in the
21st century poles can be made of _c_a_r_b_o_n_ _f_i_b_r_e._[_1_6_] Other activities, such as
_w_a_l_k_i_n_g_ _o_n_ _s_t_i_l_t_s, are still seen in _c_i_r_c_u_s performances in the 21st century.
_G_l_a_d_i_a_t_o_r_i_a_l_ _c_o_m_b_a_t_s, also known as "gladiatorial games", popular during Roman
times, provide a good example of an activity that is a combination of sport,
punishment, and entertainment.
Changes to what is regarded as entertainment can occur in response to cultural
or historical shifts. Hunting wild animals, for example, was introduced into
the _R_o_m_a_n_ _E_m_p_i_r_e from _C_a_r_t_h_a_g_e and became a popular public entertainment and
spectacle, supporting an international trade in wild animals._[_1_7_]
Entertainment also evolved into different forms and expressions as a result of
social upheavals such as wars and revolutions. During the Chinese _C_u_l_t_u_r_a_l
_R_e_v_o_l_u_t_i_o_n, for example, _R_e_v_o_l_u_t_i_o_n_a_r_y_ _o_p_e_r_a was sanctioned by the Communist
party and _W_o_r_l_d_ _W_a_r_ _I, the _G_r_e_a_t_ _D_e_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n and the _R_u_s_s_i_a_n_ _r_e_v_o_l_u_t_i_o_n all had
an impact on entertainment._[_1_8_]_[_1_9_]_[_2_0_]_[_2_1_]_[_2_2_]
Relatively minor changes to the form and venue of an entertainment continue to
come and go as they are affected by the period, fashion, culture, technology,
and economics. For example, a story told in dramatic form can be presented in
an open-air theatre, a _m_u_s_i_c_ _h_a_l_l, a _m_o_v_i_e_ _t_h_e_a_t_r_e, a _m_u_l_t_i_p_l_e_x, or as
technological possibilities advanced, via a personal electronic device such as
a _t_a_b_l_e_t_ _c_o_m_p_u_t_e_r. Entertainment is provided for mass audiences in purpose-
built structures such as a _t_h_e_a_t_r_e, _a_u_d_i_t_o_r_i_u_m, or _s_t_a_d_i_u_m. One of the most
famous venues in the Western world, the _C_o_l_o_s_s_e_u_m, "dedicated AD 80 with a
hundred days of games, held fifty thousand spectators," and in it audiences
"enjoyed "blood sport with the trappings of stage shows"._[_2_3_] _S_p_e_c_t_a_c_l_e_s,
competitions, _r_a_c_e_s, and sports were once presented in this purpose-built arena
as public entertainment. New stadia continue to be built to suit the ever more
sophisticated requirements of global audiences.

Tournament before an audience and musicians (14th century)
_R_a_l_p_h_ _H_e_d_l_e_y The Tournament (1898) Children adapting a courtly entertainment
Imperial and royal courts have provided training grounds and support for
professional entertainers, with different cultures using palaces, castles and
forts in different ways. In the _M_a_y_a_ _c_i_t_y_ _s_t_a_t_e_s, for example, "spectacles
often took place in large plazas in front of palaces; the crowds gathered
either there or in designated places from which they could watch at a
distance."_[_2_4_] Court entertainments also crossed cultures. For example, the
_d_u_r_b_a_r was introduced to India by the _M_u_g_h_a_l_s, and passed onto the _B_r_i_t_i_s_h
_E_m_p_i_r_e, which then followed Indian tradition: "institutions, titles, customs,
ceremonies by which a _M_a_h_a_r_a_j_a or _N_a_w_a_b were installed ... the exchange of
official presents ... the order of precedence", for example, were "all
inherited from ... the Emperors of Delhi"._[_2_5_] In Korea, the "court
entertainment dance" was "originally performed in the palace for entertainment
at court banquets."_[_2_6_]
Court entertainment often moved from being associated with the court to more
general use among _c_o_m_m_o_n_e_r_s. This was the case with "masked dance-dramas" in
Korea, which "originated in conjunction with village _s_h_a_m_a_n rituals and
eventually became largely an entertainment form for commoners"._[_2_7_] _N_a_u_t_c_h
dancers in the Mughal Empire performed in Indian courts and palaces. Another
evolution, similar to that from courtly entertainment to common practice, was
the transition from religious ritual to secular entertainment, such as happened
during the _G_o_r_y_e_o dynasty with the Narye festival. Originally "solely religious
or ritualistic, a secular component was added at the conclusion"._[_2_8_] Former
courtly entertainments, such as _j_o_u_s_t_i_n_g, often also survived in children's
games.
In some courts, such as those during the _B_y_z_a_n_t_i_n_e_ _E_m_p_i_r_e, the genders were
segregated among the upper classes, so that "at least before the period of the
_K_o_m_n_e_n_o_i" (1081‚Äì1185) men were separated from women at ceremonies where there
was entertainment such as receptions and banquets._[_2_9_]
Court ceremonies, palace banquets and the spectacles associated with them, have
been used not only to entertain but also to demonstrate wealth and power. Such
events reinforce the relationship between ruler and ruled; between those with
power and those without, serving to "dramatise the differences between ordinary
families and that of the ruler"._[_3_0_] This is the case as much as for
traditional courts as it is for contemporary ceremonials, such as the _H_o_n_g_ _K_o_n_g
_h_a_n_d_o_v_e_r_ _c_e_r_e_m_o_n_y in 1997, at which an array of entertainments (including a
banquet, a parade, fireworks, a festival performance and an art spectacle) were
put to the service of highlighting a change in political power. Court
entertainments were typically performed for royalty and courtiers as well as
"for the pleasure of local and visiting dignitaries"._[_3_1_] Royal courts, such as
the Korean one, also supported traditional dances._[_3_1_] In Sudan, musical
instruments such as the so-called "slit" or "talking" drums, once "part of the
court orchestra of a powerful chief", had multiple purposes: they were used to
make music; "speak" at ceremonies; mark community events; send long-distance
messages; and call men to hunt or war._[_3_2_]_[_3_3_]_[_3_4_]
Courtly entertainments also demonstrate the complex relationship between
entertainer and spectator: individuals may be either an entertainer or part of
the audience, or they may swap roles even during the course of one
entertainment. In the court at the _P_a_l_a_c_e_ _o_f_ _V_e_r_s_a_i_l_l_e_s, "thousands of
courtiers, including men and women who inhabited its apartments, acted as both
performers and spectators in daily rituals that reinforced the status
hierarchy"._[_3_0_]
Like court entertainment, royal occasions such as coronations and weddings
provided opportunities to entertain both the _a_r_i_s_t_o_c_r_a_c_y and the people. For
example, the splendid 1595 _A_c_c_e_s_s_i_o_n_ _D_a_y celebrations of _Q_u_e_e_n_ _E_l_i_z_a_b_e_t_h_ _I
offered _t_o_u_r_n_a_m_e_n_t_s and jousting and other events performed "not only before
the assembled court, in all their finery, but also before thousands of
Londoners eager for a good day's entertainment. Entry for the day's events at
the _T_i_l_t_y_a_r_d in _W_h_i_t_e_h_a_l_l was set at _1_2_d"._[_3_5_]

Although most forms of entertainment have evolved and continued over time, some
once-popular forms are no longer as acceptable. For example, during earlier
centuries in Europe, watching or participating in the punishment of criminals
or social outcasts was an accepted and popular form of entertainment. Many
forms of _p_u_b_l_i_c_ _h_u_m_i_l_i_a_t_i_o_n also offered local entertainment in the past. Even
capital punishment such as _h_a_n_g_i_n_g and _b_e_h_e_a_d_i_n_g, offered to the public as a
warning, were also regarded partly as entertainment. Capital punishments that
lasted longer, such as _s_t_o_n_i_n_g and _d_r_a_w_i_n_g_ _a_n_d_ _q_u_a_r_t_e_r_i_n_g, afforded a greater
public spectacle. "A hanging was a carnival that diverted not merely the
unemployed but the unemployable. Good bourgeois or curious aristocrats who
could afford it watched it from a carriage or rented a room."_[_3_6_] Public
punishment as entertainment lasted until the 19th century by which time "the
awesome event of a public hanging aroused the[ir] loathing of writers and
philosophers"._[_3_6_] Both _D_i_c_k_e_n_s and _T_h_a_c_k_e_r_a_y wrote about a hanging in _N_e_w_g_a_t_e
_P_r_i_s_o_n in 1840, and "taught an even wider public that executions are obscene
entertainments"._[_3_6_]

Children's entertainment is centred on _p_l_a_y and is significant for their growth
and learning. Entertainment is also provided to children or taught to them by
adults and many activities that appeal to them such as _p_u_p_p_e_t_s, _c_l_o_w_n_s,
_p_a_n_t_o_m_i_m_e_s and _c_a_r_t_o_o_n_s are also enjoyed by adults._[_3_7_]_[_3_8_]
Children have always played games. It is accepted that as well as being
entertaining, playing games helps children's development. One of the most
famous visual accounts of children's games is a painting by _P_i_e_t_e_r_ _B_r_u_e_g_e_l_ _t_h_e
_E_l_d_e_r called _C_h_i_l_d_r_e_n_'_s_ _G_a_m_e_s, painted in 1560. It depicts children playing a
range of games which were presumably typical of the time. Many of these games,
such as _m_a_r_b_l_e_s, _h_i_d_e_-_a_n_d_-_s_e_e_k, blowing _s_o_a_p_ _b_u_b_b_l_e_s and _p_i_g_g_y_b_a_c_k_ _r_i_d_i_n_g
continue to be played.

Most forms of entertainment can be or are modified to suit children's needs and
interests. During the 20th century, starting with the often criticised but
nonetheless important work of _G_._ _S_t_a_n_l_e_y_ _H_a_l_l, who "promoted the link between
the study of development and the 'new' laboratory psychology",_[_3_9_] and
especially with the work of _J_e_a_n_ _P_i_a_g_e_t, who "saw cognitive development as
being analogous to biological development",_[_4_0_] it became understood that the
_p_s_y_c_h_o_l_o_g_i_c_a_l_ _d_e_v_e_l_o_p_m_e_n_t of children occurs in stages and that their
capacities differ from adults. Hence, stories and activities, whether in books,
film, or video games were developed specifically for child audiences. Countries
have responded to the special needs of children and the rise of digital
entertainment by developing systems such as _t_e_l_e_v_i_s_i_o_n_ _c_o_n_t_e_n_t_ _r_a_t_i_n_g_ _s_y_s_t_e_m_s,

In the 21st century, as with adult products, much entertainment is available
for children on the internet for private use. This constitutes a significant
change from earlier times. The amount of time expended by children indoors on
screen-based entertainment and the "remarkable collapse of children's
engagement with nature" has drawn criticism for its negative effects on
_i_m_a_g_i_n_a_t_i_o_n, adult _c_o_g_n_i_t_i_o_n and _p_s_y_c_h_o_l_o_g_i_c_a_l_ _w_e_l_l_-_b_e_i_n_g._[_4_1_]_[_4_2_]_[_4_3_]

Banquets have been a venue for entertainment since ancient times, continuing
until the 21st century, when they are still being used for many of their
original purposes ‚Äì to impress visitors, especially important ones (44, 66, 99);
to show hospitality (22, 44, 88); as an occasion to showcase supporting
entertainments such as music or dancing, or both (22, 33). They were an integral
part of court entertainments (33, 44) and helped entertainers develop their
skills (22, 33). They are also important components of celebrations such as
coronations (99), weddings (77), _b_i_r_t_h_d_a_y_s (1100) civic or political achievements
(55), military engagements or victories (66) as well as religious obligations
(11). In modern times, banquets are commercially available, for example, in
restaurants (1100) and combined with a performance in _d_i_n_n_e_r_ _t_h_e_a_t_r_e_s. Cooking by
professional _c_h_e_f_s has also become a form of entertainment as part of global
competitions such as the _B_o_c_u_s_e_ _d_'_O_r.

_M_u_s_i_c is a supporting component of many kinds of entertainment and most kinds
of performance. For example, it is used to enhance storytelling, it is
indispensable in dance (11, 44) and opera, and is usually incorporated into
dramatic film or theatre productions._[_4_4_]
Music is also a universal and popular type of entertainment on its own,
constituting an entire performance such as when _c_o_n_c_e_r_t_s are given (22, 44, 55, 66,
77, 88, 99 ). Depending on the _r_h_y_t_h_m, _i_n_s_t_r_u_m_e_n_t, performance and style, music is
divided into many genres, such as _c_l_a_s_s_i_c_a_l, _j_a_z_z, _f_o_l_k, (44, 55, 88), _r_o_c_k, _p_o_p
_m_u_s_i_c (66, 99) or traditional (11, 33). Since the 20th century, performed music,
once available only to those who could pay for the performers, has been
available cheaply to individuals by the entertainment industry which broadcasts
it or pre-records it for sale.
The wide variety of musical performances, whether or not they are artificially
_a_m_p_l_i_f_i_e_d (66, 77, 99, 1100), all provide entertainment irrespective of whether the
performance is from _s_o_l_o_i_s_t_s (66), _c_h_o_r_a_l (22) or _o_r_c_h_e_s_t_r_a_l_ _g_r_o_u_p_s (55, 88), or
_e_n_s_e_m_b_l_e (33). Live performances use specialised venues, which might be small or
large; indoors or outdoors; free or expensive. The audiences have different
expectations of the performers as well as of their own role in the performance.
For example, some audiences expect to listen silently and are entertained by
the excellence of the music, its rendition or its interpretation (55, 88). Other
audiences of live performances are entertained by the ambience and the chance
to participate (77, 99). Even more listeners are entertained by pre-recorded
music and listen privately (1100).
The instruments used in musical entertainment are either solely the _h_u_m_a_n_ _v_o_i_c_e
(22, 66) or solely instrumental (11, 33) or some combination of the two (44, 55, 77,
88). Whether the performance is given by _v_o_c_a_l_i_s_t_s or _i_n_s_t_r_u_m_e_n_t_a_l_i_s_t_s, the
performers may be soloists or part of a small or large group, in turn
entertaining an audience that might be individual (1100), passing by (33), small
(11, 22) or large (66, 77, 88, 99). Singing is generally accompanied by instruments
although some forms, notably _a_ _c_a_p_p_e_l_l_a and _o_v_e_r_t_o_n_e_ _s_i_n_g_i_n_g, are
unaccompanied. Modern concerts often use various special effects and other
theatrics to accompany performances of singing and dancing (77).

_G_a_m_e_s are played for entertainment‚Äîsometimes purely for entertainment,
sometimes for achievement or reward as well. They can be played alone, in
teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals. The players may have an
audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a
_c_h_e_s_s_ _c_h_a_m_p_i_o_n_s_h_i_p. On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their
own audience as they take their turn to play. Often, part of the entertainment
for children playing a game is deciding who will be part of their audience and
who will be a player.
Equipment varies with the game. _B_o_a_r_d_ _g_a_m_e_s, such as _G_o, _M_o_n_o_p_o_l_y or _b_a_c_k_g_a_m_m_o_n
need a board and markers. One of the oldest known board games is _S_e_n_e_t, a game
played in Ancient Egypt, enjoyed by the _p_h_a_r_a_o_h _T_u_t_a_n_k_h_a_m_u_n._[_4_5_] _C_a_r_d_ _g_a_m_e_s,
such as _w_h_i_s_t, _p_o_k_e_r and _B_r_i_d_g_e have long been played as evening entertainment

Other games, such as _b_i_n_g_o, played with numerous strangers, have been organised
to involve the participation of non-players via _g_a_m_b_l_i_n_g. Many are _g_e_a_r_e_d_ _f_o_r

example, _c_r_o_q_u_e_t, _l_a_w_n_ _b_o_w_l_i_n_g and _p_a_i_n_t_b_a_l_l as well as many sports using
various forms of _b_a_l_l_s. The options cater to a wide range of skill and fitness
levels. Physical games can develop agility and competence in _m_o_t_o_r_ _s_k_i_l_l_s.
Number games such as _S_u_d_o_k_u and puzzle games like the _R_u_b_i_k_'_s_ _c_u_b_e can develop
mental prowess.

French poet _L_o_u_i_s_e_ _L_a_b_√_© (1520/1522‚Äì1566) wrote "a profound and timeless
insight into reading's innate power".
The past gives us pleasure and is of more service than the present; but the
delight of what we once felt is dimly lost never to return and its memory is as
distressing as the events themselves were then delectable ... But when we
happen to put our thoughts in writing, how easily, later on, does our mind race
through an infinity of events, incessantly alive, so that a long time
afterwards when we take up those written pages we can return to the same place
and to the same disposition in which we once found ourselves.
quoted in Fischer (2003)_[_4_9_]
The young Saint _T_e_r_e_s_a_ _o_f_ _√_Å_v_i_l_a (1515‚Äì1582) read chivalrous novels and wrote
about the "rapture" that books provided.
I became accustomed to reading [novels] and that small fault made me cool my
desire and will to do other tasks. I thought nothing of spending many hours a
day and night in this vain exercise, hidden from my father. My rapture in this
was so great, that unless I had a new book to read, it seemed to me that I
could not be happy.
quoted in Fischer (2003)_[_5_0_]
Reading has been a source of entertainment for a very long time, especially
when other forms, such as performance entertainments, were (or are) either
unavailable or too costly. Even when the primary purpose of the writing is to
inform or instruct, reading is well known for its capacity to distract from
everyday worries. Both stories and information have been passed on through the
tradition of _o_r_a_l_i_t_y and oral traditions survive in the form of _p_e_r_f_o_r_m_a_n_c_e
_p_o_e_t_r_y for example. However, they have drastically declined. "Once literacy had
arrived in strength, there was no return to the oral prerogative."_[_5_1_] The
advent of printing, the reduction in costs of books and an increasing literacy
all served to enhance the mass appeal of reading. Furthermore, as _f_o_n_t_s were
standardised and texts became clearer, "reading ceased being a painful process
of decipherment and became an act of pure pleasure"._[_5_2_] By the 16th century in
Europe, the appeal of reading for entertainment was well established.
Among _l_i_t_e_r_a_t_u_r_e's many genres are some designed, in whole or in part, purely
for entertainment. _L_i_m_e_r_i_c_k_s, for example, use verse in a strict, predictable
rhyme and rhythm to create humour and to amuse an audience of listeners or
readers. Interactive books such as "_c_h_o_o_s_e_ _y_o_u_r_ _o_w_n_ _a_d_v_e_n_t_u_r_e" can make
literary entertainment more participatory.
Readers entertained by comic books (1971)
_C_o_m_i_c_s and cartoons are literary genres that use drawings or graphics, usually
in combination with text, to convey an entertaining narrative._[_5_3_] Many
contemporary comics have elements of _f_a_n_t_a_s_y and are produced by companies that
are part of the _e_n_t_e_r_t_a_i_n_m_e_n_t_ _i_n_d_u_s_t_r_y. Others have unique authors who offer a
more personal, philosophical view of the world and the problems people face.
Comics about _s_u_p_e_r_h_e_r_o_e_s such as _S_u_p_e_r_m_a_n are of the first type._[_5_4_] Examples
of the second sort include the individual work over 50 years of _C_h_a_r_l_e_s_ _M_.

Japanese _M_a_n_g_a style differs from the western approach in that it encompasses a
wide range of genres and themes for a readership of all ages. _C_a_r_i_c_a_t_u_r_e uses a
kind of graphic entertainment for purposes ranging from merely putting a smile
on the viewer's face, to raising social awareness, to highlighting the moral
characteristics of a person being caricatured.

_C_o_m_e_d_y is both a _g_e_n_r_e of entertainment and a component of it, providing
laughter and amusement, whether the comedy is the sole purpose or used as a
form of contrast in an otherwise serious piece. It is a valued contributor to
many forms of entertainment, including in literature, theatre, opera, film and
games._[_5_7_]_[_5_8_] In royal courts, such as for example, in the Byzantine court,
and presumably, also in its wealthy households, "_m_i_m_e_s were the focus of
orchestrated humour, expected or obliged to make fun of all at court, not even
excepting the emperor and members of the imperial family. This highly
structured role of _j_e_s_t_e_r consisted of verbal humour, including _t_e_a_s_i_n_g, jests,
_i_n_s_u_l_t, ridicule, and _o_b_s_c_e_n_i_t_y and _n_o_n_-_v_e_r_b_a_l humour such as _s_l_a_p_s_t_i_c_k and
horseplay in the presence of an audience."_[_2_9_] In medieval times, all comic
types ‚Äì the _b_u_f_f_o_o_n, jester, _h_u_n_c_h_b_a_c_k, _d_w_a_r_f, jokester, were all "considered
to be essentially of one comic type: the fool", who while not necessarily
funny, represented "the shortcomings of the individual"._[_5_9_]_[_6_0_]
Shakespeare wrote seventeen _c_o_m_e_d_i_e_s which use many of the techniques still
called upon by performers and writers of comedy, such as _j_o_k_e_s, _p_u_n_s, _p_a_r_o_d_y,
_w_i_t, _o_b_s_e_r_v_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _h_u_m_o_r or the unexpected effect of _i_r_o_n_y._[_6_1_]_[_6_2_] _O_n_e_-_l_i_n_e_r
_j_o_k_e_s and satire are also used to comedic effect in literature. In _f_a_r_c_e, the
comedy is a primary purpose.
The meaning of the word "comedy" and the audience's expectations of it have
changed over time and vary according to culture._[_6_3_] Simple physical comedy
such as _s_l_a_p_s_t_i_c_k is entertaining to a broad range of people of all ages.
However, as cultures become more sophisticated, national nuances appear in the
style and references so that what is amusing in one culture may be
unintelligible in another._[_6_4_]

Live performances before an audience constitute a major form of entertainment,
especially before the invention of audio and video recording. Performance takes
a wide range of forms, including theatre, music and drama. In the 16th and 17th
centuries, European royal courts presented _m_a_s_q_u_e_s that were complex theatrical
entertainments involving dancing, singing and acting. Opera is a similarly
demanding performance style that remains popular. It also encompass all three
forms, demanding a high level of musical and dramatic skill, collaboration and
like the masque, production expertise as well.

Audiences generally show their appreciation of an entertaining performance with
applause. However, all performers run the risk of failing to hold their
audience's attention and thus, failing to entertain. Audience dissatisfaction
is often brutally honest and direct.
     "Of course you all ought to know that while singing a good song or,
     or giving a good recitation ... helps to arrest the company's
     attention ... Such at least was the case with me ‚Äì the _p_u_b_l_i_c_a_n
     devised a plan to bring my entertainment to an end abruptly, and the
     plan was, he told the waiter to throw a wet towel at me, which, of
     course, the waiter did ... and I received the wet towel, full force,
     in the face, which staggered me ... and had the desired effect of
     putting an end to me giving any more entertainments in the house."

_S_t_o_r_y_t_e_l_l_i_n_g is an ancient form of entertainment that has influenced almost all
other forms. It is "not only entertainment, it is also thinking through human
conflicts and contradictions"._[_1_5_] Hence, although stories may be delivered
directly to a small listening audience, they are also presented as
entertainment and used as a component of any piece that relies on a narrative,
such as film, drama, ballet, and opera. Written stories have been enhanced by
illustrations, often to a very high artistic standard, for example, on
_i_l_l_u_m_i_n_a_t_e_d_ _m_a_n_u_s_c_r_i_p_t_s and on ancient scrolls such as Japanese ones._[_6_6_]
Stories remain a common way of entertaining a group that is on a journey.
_C_h_a_u_c_e_r uses _p_i_l_g_r_i_m_s in his literary work _T_h_e_ _C_a_n_t_e_r_b_u_r_y_ _T_a_l_e_s to show how
stories are used to pass the time and entertain an audience of travellers. Even
though journeys can now be completed much faster, stories are still told to
passengers en route in cars and aeroplanes either orally or delivered by some
form of technology.
The power of stories to entertain is evident in one of the most famous
ones‚Äî_S_c_h_e_h_e_r_a_z_a_d_e‚Äîa story in the _P_e_r_s_i_a_n professional storytelling
tradition, of a woman who saves her own life by telling stories._[_6_7_]_[_6_8_]_[_6_9_]
The connections between the different types of entertainment are shown by the
way that stories like this inspire a retelling in another medium, such as
music, film or games. For example, composers _R_i_m_s_k_y_-_K_o_r_s_a_k_o_v, _R_a_v_e_l and
_S_z_y_m_a_n_o_w_s_k_i have each been inspired by the Scheherazade story and turned it
into an orchestral work; director _P_a_s_o_l_i_n_i made a _f_i_l_m_ _a_d_a_p_t_a_t_i_o_n; and there is
an _i_n_n_o_v_a_t_i_v_e_ _v_i_d_e_o_ _g_a_m_e based on the tale. Stories may be told wordlessly, in
music, dance or puppetry for example, such as in the Javanese tradition of
_w_a_y_a_n_g, in which the performance is accompanied by a _g_a_m_e_l_a_n orchestra or the
similarly traditional _P_u_n_c_h_ _a_n_d_ _J_u_d_y show.
Epic poems such as _H_o_m_e_r's _O_d_y_s_s_e_y and _I_l_i_a_d, and _s_a_g_a_s such as the _S_a_g_a_s_ _o_f
_I_c_e_l_a_n_d_e_r_s or the celebrated _T_a_l_e_ _o_f_ _t_h_e_ _G_e_n_j_i, tell such gripping stories that
they have inspired countless other stories in all forms of entertainment.
Collections of stories, such as _G_r_i_m_m_s_'_ _F_a_i_r_y_ _T_a_l_e_s, have been similarly
influential. This collection of folk stories was originally published in the
early 19th century, became iconic and had significant influence in modern
popular culture which subsequently used its themes, images, symbols and
structural elements to create new forms of entertainment._[_7_0_]
Some of the most powerful and long-lasting stories are the foundation stories,
also called _o_r_i_g_i_n or _c_r_e_a_t_i_o_n_ _m_y_t_h_s such as the _D_r_e_a_m_t_i_m_e myths of the

stories of the origin of the world._[_7_2_] These too are developed into books,
films, music and games in a way that increases their longevity and enhances
their entertainment value.

_T_h_e_a_t_r_e performances, typically dramatic or musical, are presented on a stage
for an audience and have a history that goes back to _H_e_l_l_e_n_i_s_t_i_c_ _t_i_m_e_s when
"leading musicians and actors" performed widely at "poetical competitions", for
example at "_D_e_l_p_h_i, _D_e_l_o_s, _E_p_h_e_s_u_s"._[_7_3_] _A_r_i_s_t_o_t_l_e and his teacher _P_l_a_t_o both
wrote on the theory and purpose of theatre. Aristotle posed questions such as
"What is the function of the arts in shaping character? Should a member of the
ruling class merely watch performances or be a participant and perform? What
kind of entertainment should be provided for those who do not belong to the
elite?"_[_7_4_] The "Ptolemys in Egypt, the _S_e_l_e_u_c_i_d_s in _P_e_r_g_a_m_u_m" also had a
strong theatrical tradition and later, wealthy patrons in Rome staged "far more
lavish productions"._[_7_5_]_[_7_6_]
Expectations about the performance and their engagement with it have changed
over time (11)._[_7_7_] For example, in England during the 18th century, "the
prejudice against actresses had faded"_[_7_8_] and in Europe generally, going to
the theatre, once a socially dubious activity, became "a more respectable
middle-class pastime"_[_7_9_] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when the
variety of popular entertainments increased. _O_p_e_r_e_t_t_a and music halls became
available, and new drama theatres such as the _M_o_s_c_o_w_ _A_r_t_ _T_h_e_a_t_r_e and the
_S_u_v_o_r_i_n_ _T_h_e_a_t_r_e in Russia opened._[_8_0_] At the same time, commercial newspapers
"began to carry theatre columns and reviews" which helped to make theatre "a
legitimate subject of intellectual debate" in general discussions about art and
culture._[_8_0_] Audiences began to gather to "appreciate creative achievement, to
marvel at, and be entertained by, the prominent 'stars'."_[_8_0_] _V_a_u_d_e_v_i_l_l_e and
music halls, popular at this time in the United States, England, Canada,
Australia and New Zealand, were themselves eventually superseded._[_8_1_]
_P_l_a_y_s,_[_8_2_] _m_u_s_i_c_a_l_s,_[_8_3_] _m_o_n_o_l_o_g_u_e_s, _p_a_n_t_o_m_i_m_e_s, and _p_e_r_f_o_r_m_a_n_c_e_ _p_o_e_t_r_y are
part of the very long history of theatre which is also the venue for the type
of performance known as _s_t_a_n_d_-_u_p_ _c_o_m_e_d_y._[_8_4_] In the 20th century, _r_a_d_i_o and
_t_e_l_e_v_i_s_i_o_n, often broadcast live, extended the theatrical tradition that
continued to exist alongside the new forms.
The stage and the spaces set out in front of it for an audience create a

the elaborate (99); or the traditional and permanent (55, 77). They are erected

preparing the stage for a performance is known as _s_t_a_g_e_c_r_a_f_t (1100). The
audience's experience of the entertainment is affected by their expectations,
the stagecraft, the type of stage, and the type and standard of seating
provided.

Film audiences are typically seated in comfortable chairs arranged in close
rows before a projection screen. Norway (2005)
_F_i_l_m_s are a major form of entertainment, although not all films have
entertainment as their primary purpose: _d_o_c_u_m_e_n_t_a_r_y_ _f_i_l_m, for example, aims to
create a record or inform,_[_8_5_] although the two purposes often work together.
The medium was a global business from the beginning: "The _L_u_m_i_√_®_r_e_ _b_r_o_t_h_e_r_s
were the first to send cameramen throughout the world, instructing them to film
everything which could be of interest for the public."_[_8_6_] In 1908, _P_a_t_h_√_©
launched and distributed _n_e_w_s_r_e_e_l_s_[_8_6_] and by _W_o_r_l_d_ _W_a_r_ _I, films were meeting
an enormous need for mass entertainment. "In the first decade of the [20th]
century cinematic programmes combined, at random, fictions and newsfilms."_[_8_6_]
The Americans first "contrived a way of producing an illusion of motion through
successive images," but "the French were able to transform a scientific
principle into a commercially lucrative spectacle"._[_8_7_] Film therefore became a
part of the entertainment industry from its early days. Increasingly
sophisticated techniques have been used in the film medium to delight and
entertain audiences. _A_n_i_m_a_t_i_o_n, which involves the display of rapid movement in
an art work, is one of these techniques that particularly appeals to younger
audiences._[_8_8_]
Films also re-imagine entertainment from other forms, turning stories, books
and plays, for example, into new entertainments._[_8_9_] _T_h_e_ _S_t_o_r_y_ _o_f_ _F_i_l_m, a
documentary about the _h_i_s_t_o_r_y_ _o_f_ _f_i_l_m, gives a survey of global achievements
and innovations in the medium, as well as changes in the conception of film-
making. It demonstrates that while some films, particularly those in the
_H_o_l_l_y_w_o_o_d tradition that combines "realism and _m_e_l_o_d_r_a_m_a_t_i_c romanticism"_[_9_0_],
are intended as a form of _e_s_c_a_p_i_s_m, others require a deeper engagement or more
thoughtful response from their audiences. For example, the award winning
Senegalese film _X_a_l_a takes government corruption as its theme.

Dancers creating their own entertainment at a ball.
Peterborough (2008) (silent video)
The many forms of _d_a_n_c_e provide entertainment for all age groups and cultures.
Dance can be serious in tone, such as when it is used to express a culture's
history or important stories; it may be provocative; or it may put in the
service of comedy. Since it combines many forms of entertainment ‚Äì music,
movement, storytelling, theatre ‚Äì it provides a good example of the various
ways that these forms can be combined to create entertainment for different
purposes and audiences.
Dance is "a form of cultural representation" that involves not just dancers,
but "_c_h_o_r_e_o_g_r_a_p_h_e_r_s, audience members, _p_a_t_r_o_n_s and _i_m_p_r_e_s_a_r_i_o_s ... coming from
all over the globe and from vastly varied time periods."_[_9_1_] Whether from
Africa, Asia or Europe, dance is constantly negotiating the realms of
political, social, spiritual and artistic influence."_[_9_2_] Even though dance
traditions may be limited to one cultural group, they all develop. For example,
in Africa, there are "_D_a_h_o_m_e_a_n dances, _H_a_u_s_a dances, _M_a_s_a_i dances and so
forth."_[_9_3_] _B_a_l_l_e_t is an example of a highly developed Western form of dance
that moved to the theatres from the French court during the time of _L_o_u_i_s_ _X_I_V,
the dancers becoming professional theatrical performers._[_9_4_] Some dances, such
as the _q_u_a_d_r_i_l_l_e, a square dance that "emerged during the _N_a_p_o_l_e_o_n_i_c_ _y_e_a_r_s in
France"_[_9_5_] were once popular at social gatherings like _b_a_l_l_s,_[_9_6_] but are now
rarely performed. On the other hand, many dances, including _f_o_l_k_ _d_a_n_c_e_s (such
as _S_c_o_t_t_i_s_h_ _H_i_g_h_l_a_n_d_ _d_a_n_c_i_n_g and _I_r_i_s_h_ _d_a_n_c_i_n_g), have evolved into
competitions, which by adding to their audiences, has increased their
entertainment value. "Irish dance theatre, which sometimes features traditional
Irish steps and music, has developed into a major dance form with an
international reputation."_[_9_7_]
Since dance is often "associated with the female body and women's experiences",
_[_9_2_] female dancers, who dance to entertain, have in some cases been regarded
as distinct from "decent" women because they "use their bodies to make a living
instead of hiding them as much as possible"._[_9_8_] Society's attitudes to female
dancers depend on the culture, its history and the entertainment industry
itself. For example, while some cultures regard any dancing by women as "the
most shameful form of entertainment",_[_9_9_] other cultures have established
venues such as _s_t_r_i_p_ _c_l_u_b_s where deliberately erotic or sexually provocative
dances such as _s_t_r_i_p_t_e_a_s_e are performed in public by professional women dancers
for mostly male audiences.
Various political regimes have sought to control or ban dancing or specific
types of dancing, sometimes because of disapproval of the music or clothes
associated with it. Nationalism, authoritarianism and racism have played a part
in banning dances or dancing. For example, during the _N_a_z_i regime, American
dances such as _s_w_i_n_g, regarded as "completely un-German", had "become a public
offense and needed to be banned"._[_1_0_0_] Similarly, in Shanghai, China, in the
1930s, "dancing and nightclubs had come to symbolise the excess that plagued
Chinese society" and officials wondered if "other forms of entertainment such
as _b_r_o_t_h_e_l_s" should also be banned. Banning had the effect of making "the dance
craze" even greater._[_1_0_1_] In Ireland, the Public Dance Hall Act of 1935 "banned
‚Äì but did not stop ‚Äì dancing at the crossroads and other popular dance
forms such as house and _b_a_r_n_ _d_a_n_c_e_s."_[_9_7_] In the US, various dances have been
banned, either because like _b_u_r_l_e_s_q_u_e, they were suggestive,_[_1_0_2_] or because,
like the _T_w_i_s_t, they were associated with _A_f_r_i_c_a_n_ _A_m_e_r_i_c_a_n_s._[_1_0_3_] "African
American dancers were typically banned from performing in _m_i_n_s_t_r_e_l_ _s_h_o_w_s until
after the _C_i_v_i_l_ _W_a_r."_[_1_0_4_]
Dances can be performed _s_o_l_o (11, 44); in pairs, (22, 33); in groups, (55, 66, 77); or
by massed performers (1100). They might be improvised (44, 88) or highly
choreographed (11, 22, 55, 1100); spontaneous for personal entertainment, (such as
when children begin dancing for themselves); a private audience, (44); a paying
audience (22); a world audience (1100); or an audience interested in a particular
dance genre (33, 55). They might be a part of a celebration, such as a _w_e_d_d_i_n_g or
_N_e_w_ _Y_e_a_r (66, 88); or a cultural ritual with a specific purpose, such as a dance
by _w_a_r_r_i_o_r_s like a _h_a_k_a (77). Some dances, such as traditional dance in 11 and
ballet in 22, need a very high level of skill and training; others, such as the
_c_a_n_-_c_a_n, require a very high level of energy and physical fitness. Entertaining
the audience is a normal part of dance but its physicality often also produces
joy for the dancers themselves (99).

Animals have been used for the purposes of entertainment for millennia. They
have been hunted for entertainment (as opposed to hunted for food); displayed
while they hunt for prey; watched when they compete with each other; and
watched while they perform a trained routine for human amusement. The Romans,
for example, were entertained both by competitions involving wild animals and
acts performed by trained animals. They watched as "lions and bears danced to
the music of pipes and _c_y_m_b_a_l_s; horses were trained to kneel, bow, dance and
prance ... acrobats turning handsprings over wild lions and vaulting over wild
leopards." There were "violent confrontations with wild beasts" and
"performances over time became more brutal and bloodier"._[_1_0_5_]
Animals that perform trained routines or "acts" for human entertainment include
fleas in _f_l_e_a_ _c_i_r_c_u_s_e_s, dolphins in _d_o_l_p_h_i_n_a_r_i_a, and monkeys doing tricks for
an audience on behalf of the player of a _s_t_r_e_e_t_ _o_r_g_a_n. Animals kept in _z_o_o_s in
ancient times were often kept there for later use in the arena as entertainment
or for their entertainment value as exotica._[_1_0_6_]
Many contests between animals are now regarded as sports ‚Äì for example, _h_o_r_s_e
_r_a_c_i_n_g is regarded as both a sport and an important source of entertainment.
Its economic impact means that it is also considered a global industry, one in
which horses are carefully transported around the world to compete in races. In
Australia, the horse race run on _M_e_l_b_o_u_r_n_e_ _C_u_p Day is a public holiday and the
public regards the race as an important annual event. Like horse racing, _c_a_m_e_l
_r_a_c_i_n_g requires human riders, while _g_r_e_y_h_o_u_n_d_ _r_a_c_i_n_g does not. People find it
entertaining to watch animals race competitively, whether they are trained,
like horses, camels or dogs, or untrained, like _c_o_c_k_r_o_a_c_h_e_s.
The use of animals for entertainment is often controversial, especially the
hunting of wild animals. Some contests between animals, once popular
entertainment for the public, have become illegal because of the cruelty
involved. Among these are _b_l_o_o_d_ _s_p_o_r_t_s such as _b_e_a_r_-_b_a_i_t_i_n_g, _d_o_g_ _f_i_g_h_t_i_n_g and
_c_o_c_k_f_i_g_h_t_i_n_g. Other contests involving animals remain controversial and have
both supporters and detractors. For example, the conflict between opponents of
pigeon shooting who view it as "a cruel and moronic exercise in marksmanship,
and proponents, who view it as entertainment" has been tested in a court of
law._[_1_0_7_] _F_o_x_ _h_u_n_t_i_n_g, which involves the use of horses as well as hounds, and
_b_u_l_l_f_i_g_h_t_i_n_g, which has a strong theatrical component, are two entertainments
that have a long and significant cultural history. They both involve animals
and are variously regarded as sport, entertainment or cultural tradition. Among
the organisations set up to advocate for the rights of animals are some whose
concerns include the use of animals for entertainment._[_1_0_8_] However, "in many
cases of animal advocacy groups versus organisations accused of animal abuse,
both sides have cultural claims."_[_1_0_9_]

A _c_i_r_c_u_s, described as "one of the most brazen of entertainment forms",_[_1_1_0_] is
a special type of theatrical performance, involving _a_c_r_o_b_a_t_i_c_s and often
performing animals, usually thought of as a travelling show, although permanent
venues have also been used. _P_h_i_l_i_p_ _A_s_t_l_e_y is regarded as the founder of the

generally familiar in traditional British fairs "at least since the beginning

on"._[_1_1_0_] It has been claimed that "there is no direct link between the Roman
circus and the circus of modern times. ... Between the demise of the Roman
'circus' and the foundation of Astley's Amphitheatre in London some 1300 years
later, the nearest thing to a circus ring was the rough circle formed by the
curious onlookers who gathered around the itinerant tumbler or juggler on a

The form of entertainment known as _s_t_a_g_e_ _m_a_g_i_c or conjuring and recognisable as
performance, is based on traditions and texts of magical rites and dogmas that
have been a part of most cultural traditions since ancient times. (References
to magic, for example, can be found in the _B_i_b_l_e, in _H_e_r_m_e_t_i_c_i_s_m, in
_Z_o_r_o_a_s_t_r_i_a_n_i_s_m, in the _K_a_b_b_a_l_i_s_t_i_c tradition, in _m_y_s_t_i_c_i_s_m and in the sources
of _F_r_e_e_m_a_s_o_n_r_y.)_[_1_1_3_] Performance magic relies on deception, psychological
manipulation, sleight of hand and other forms of trickery to give an audience
the illusion that a performer can achieve the impossible.
Stage magic is performed for an audience in a variety of media and locations:
on stage, on television, in the street, and live at parties or events. It is
often combined with other forms of entertainment, such as comedy or music and
_s_h_o_w_m_a_n_s_h_i_p is often an essential part of magic performances. Audiences amazed

_F_a_n_t_a_s_y_ _m_a_g_i_c_i_a_n_s have held an important place in literature for centuries,

It was "an integral aspect of London's life", for example, when the city in the
early 19th century was "filled with spectacle and diversion"._[_1_1_7_] _M_i_n_s_t_r_e_l_s or
_t_r_o_u_b_a_d_o_u_r_s are part of the tradition. The art and practice of busking is still
celebrated at annual busking festivals._[_1_1_8_]
There are three basic forms of contemporary street performance. The first form
is the "circle show". It tends to gather a crowd, usually has a distinct
beginning and end, and is done in conjunction with _s_t_r_e_e_t_ _t_h_e_a_t_r_e,
_p_u_p_p_e_t_e_e_r_i_n_g, _m_a_g_i_c_i_a_n_s, _c_o_m_e_d_i_a_n_s, acrobats, _j_u_g_g_l_e_r_s and sometimes _m_u_s_i_c_i_a_n_s.
This type has the potential to be the most lucrative for the performer because
there are likely to be more donations from larger audiences if they are
entertained by the act. Good buskers control the crowd so patrons do not
obstruct foot traffic. The second form, the "walk-by act", has no distinct
beginning or end. Typically, the busker provides an entertaining ambience,
often with an unusual instrument, and the audience may not stop to watch or
form a crowd. Sometimes a walk-by act will spontaneously turn into a circle
show. The third form, "caf√© busking", is performed mostly in restaurants,
pubs, bars and caf√©s. This type of act occasionally uses _p_u_b_l_i_c_ _t_r_a_n_s_p_o_r_t as a
venue.

_P_a_r_a_d_e_s are held for a range of purposes, often more than one. Whether their
mood is sombre or festive, being public events that are designed to attract
attention and activities that necessarily divert normal traffic, parades have a
clear entertainment value to their audiences. _C_a_v_a_l_c_a_d_e_s and the modern
variant, the _m_o_t_o_r_c_a_d_e, are examples of public processions. Some people
watching the parade or procession may have made a special effort to attend,
while others become part of the audience by happenstance. Whatever their mood
or primary purpose, parades attract and entertain people who watch them pass
by. Occasionally, a parade takes place in an improvised theatre space (such as
the _T_r_o_o_p_i_n_g_ _t_h_e_ _C_o_l_o_u_r in 55) and tickets are sold to the physical audience
while the global audience participates via broadcast.
One of the earliest forms of parade were "_t_r_i_u_m_p_h_s" ‚Äì grand and sensational
displays of foreign treasures and spoils, given by triumphant Roman generals to
celebrate their victories. They presented conquered peoples and nations that
exalted the prestige of the victor. "In the summer of 46 B.C.E. _J_u_l_i_u_s_ _C_a_e_s_a_r
chose to celebrate four triumphs held on different days extending for about one
month."_[_1_1_9_] In Europe from the Middle Ages to the _B_a_r_o_q_u_e the _R_o_y_a_l_ _E_n_t_r_y
celebrated the formal visit of the monarch to the city with a parade through
elaborately decorated streets, passing various shows and displays. The annual
_L_o_r_d_ _M_a_y_o_r_'_s_ _S_h_o_w in London is an example of a civic parade that has survived
since medieval times.
Many religious festivals (especially those which incorporate _p_r_o_c_e_s_s_i_o_n_s, such
as _H_o_l_y_ _W_e_e_k_ _p_r_o_c_e_s_s_i_o_n_s or the Indian festival of _H_o_l_i) have some
entertainment appeal in addition to their serious purpose. Sometimes, religious
rituals have been adapted or evolved into secular entertainments, or like the
_F_e_s_t_a_ _d_e_l_ _R_e_d_e_n_t_o_r_e in Venice, have managed to grow in popularity while holding
both secular and sacred purposes in balance. However, _p_i_l_g_r_i_m_a_g_e_s, such as the
Christian pilgrimage of the _W_a_y_ _o_f_ _S_t_._ _J_a_m_e_s, the Muslim _H_a_j_j and the Hindu
_K_u_m_b_h_ _M_e_l_a, which may appear to the outsider as an entertaining parade or
procession, are not intended as entertainment: they are instead about an
individual's spiritual journey. Hence, the relationship between spectator and
participant, unlike entertainments proper, is different. The manner in which
the Kumbh Mela, for example, "is divorced from its cultural context and
repackaged for Western consumption ‚Äì renders the presence of _v_o_y_e_u_r_s deeply
problematic."_[_1_2_0_]
Parades generally impress and delight (55, 66, 77, 88), often by including unusual,
colourful costumes (66, 77). Sometimes they also commemorate (55, 88) or celebrate
(11, 44, 88, 99, 1100). Sometimes they have a serious purpose, such as when the
context is military (11, 22, 55), when the intention is sometimes to intimidate;
or religious, when the audience might participate or have a role to play (66, 77,
99). Even if a parade uses new technology and is some distance away (1100), it is
likely to have a strong appeal, draw the attention of onlookers and entertain
them.

_F_i_r_e_w_o_r_k_s are a part of many public entertainments and have retained an
enduring popularity since they became a "crowning feature of elaborate
celebrations" in the 17th century. First used in China, classical antiquity and
Europe for military purposes, fireworks were most popular in the 18th century
and high prices were paid for _p_y_r_o_t_e_c_h_n_i_s_t_s, especially the skilled Italian
ones, who were summoned to other countries to organise displays._[_1_2_1_]_[_1_2_2_] Fire
and water were important aspects of court spectacles because the displays
"inspired by means of fire, sudden noise, smoke and general magnificence the
sentiments thought fitting for the subject to entertain of his sovereign: awe
fear and a vicarious sense of glory in his might. Birthdays, name-days,
weddings and anniversaries provided the occasion for celebration."_[_1_2_3_] One of
the most famous courtly uses of fireworks was one used to celebrate the end of
the _W_a_r_ _o_f_ _t_h_e_ _A_u_s_t_r_i_a_n_ _S_u_c_c_e_s_s_i_o_n and while the fireworks themselves caused a
fire,_[_1_2_4_] the accompanying _M_u_s_i_c_ _f_o_r_ _t_h_e_ _R_o_y_a_l_ _F_i_r_e_w_o_r_k_s written by _H_a_n_d_e_l has
been popular ever since. Aside from their contribution to entertainments
related to military successes, courtly displays and personal celebrations,
fireworks are also used as part of religious ceremony. For example, during the
Indian _D_a_s_h_a_v_a_t_a_r_a Kala of Gomantaka "the temple deity is taken around in a
procession with a lot of singing, dancing and display of fireworks"._[_1_2_5_]
The "fire, sudden noise and smoke" of fireworks is still a significant part of
public celebration and entertainment. For example, fireworks were one of the
primary forms of display chosen to celebrate the turn of the _m_i_l_l_e_n_n_i_u_m around
the world. As the clock struck midnight and 1999 became 2000, firework displays
and open-air parties greeted the _N_e_w_ _Y_e_a_r as the _t_i_m_e_ _z_o_n_e_s changed over to the
next century. Fireworks, carefully planned and choreographed, were let off
against the backdrop of many of the world's most famous buildings, including
the _S_y_d_n_e_y_ _H_a_r_b_o_u_r_ _B_r_i_d_g_e, the _P_y_r_a_m_i_d_s_ _o_f_ _G_i_z_a in Egypt, the _A_c_r_o_p_o_l_i_s in

_S_p_o_r_t_i_n_g competitions have always provided entertainment for crowds. To
distinguish the players from the audience, the latter are often known as
spectators. Developments in _s_t_a_d_i_u_m and _a_u_d_i_t_o_r_i_u_m design, as well as in
recording and broadcast technology, have allowed off-site spectators to watch
sport, with the result that the size of the audience has grown ever larger and
_s_p_e_c_t_a_t_o_r_ _s_p_o_r_t has become increasingly popular. Two of the most popular sports
with global appeal are _a_s_s_o_c_i_a_t_i_o_n_ _f_o_o_t_b_a_l_l and _c_r_i_c_k_e_t. Their ultimate
international competitions, the _W_o_r_l_d_ _C_u_p and _t_e_s_t_ _c_r_i_c_k_e_t, are broadcast
around the world. Beyond the very large numbers involved in playing these
sports, they are notable for being a major source of entertainment for many
millions of non-players worldwide._[_1_2_6_] A comparable multi-stage, long-form
sport with global appeal is the _T_o_u_r_ _d_e_ _F_r_a_n_c_e, unusual in that it takes place
outside of special stadia, being run instead in the countryside._[_1_2_7_]
Aside from sports that have world-wide appeal and competitions, such as the
_O_l_y_m_p_i_c_ _G_a_m_e_s, the entertainment value of a sport depends on the culture and
country in which it is played. For example, in the United States, _b_a_s_e_b_a_l_l and
_b_a_s_k_e_t_b_a_l_l games are popular forms of entertainment; in Bhutan, the national
sport is archery; in New Zealand, it is _r_u_g_b_y_ _u_n_i_o_n; in Iran, it is _f_r_e_e_s_t_y_l_e
_w_r_e_s_t_l_i_n_g. Japan's unique _s_u_m_o wrestling contains ritual elements that derive
from its long history._[_1_2_8_] In some cases, such as the international running
group _H_a_s_h_ _H_o_u_s_e_ _H_a_r_r_i_e_r_s, participants create a blend of sport and
entertainment for themselves, largely independent of spectator involvement,
where the social component is more important than the competitive.
The evolution of an activity into a sport and then an entertainment is also
affected by the local climate and conditions. For example, the modern sport of
_s_u_r_f_i_n_g is associated with Hawaii and that of _s_n_o_w_ _s_k_i_i_n_g probably evolved in
Scandinavia. While these sports and the entertainment they offer to spectators
have spread around the world, people in the two originating countries remain
well known for their prowess. Sometimes the climate offers a chance to adapt
another sport such as in the case of _i_c_e_ _h_o_c_k_e_y which is an important
entertainment in Canada.

_F_a_i_r_s and exhibitions have existed since ancient and medieval times, displaying
wealth, innovations and objects for trade and offering specific entertainments
as well as being places of entertainment in themselves._[_1_2_9_] Whether in a
medieval market or a small shop, "shopping always offered forms of exhilaration
that took one away from the everyday"._[_1_3_0_] However, in the modern world,
"merchandising has become entertainment: spinning signs, flashing signs,
thumping music ... video screens, interactive computer kiosks, day care ..
caf√©s"._[_1_3_0_]
By the 19th century, "expos" which encourage arts, manufactures and commerce
had become truly international and were not only hugely popular but were having
an enormous impact on international ideas. For example, the _1_8_7_8_ _P_a_r_i_s
_E_x_p_o_s_i_t_i_o_n facilitated international cooperation about ideas, innovations and
standards. From London 1851 to Paris 1900, "in excess of 200 million visitors
had entered the turnstiles in London, Paris, Vienna, Philadelphia, Chicago and
a myriad of smaller shows around the world."_[_1_2_9_]_[_1_3_1_] Since _W_o_r_l_d_ _W_a_r_ _I_I "well
over 500 million visits have been recorded through world expo turnstiles"._[_1_3_2_]
As a form of spectacle and entertainment, expositions influenced "everything
from architecture, to patterns of globalisation, to fundamental matters of
human identity"_[_1_3_2_] and in the process established the close relationship
between "fairs, the rise of department stores and art museums",_[_1_3_3_] the modern
world of mass consumption and the entertainment industry.

Some entertainments, such as at large festivals (whether religious or secular),
concerts, clubs, parties and celebrations, involve big crowds. From earliest
times, crowds at an entertainment have associated hazards and dangers,
