AAggrriiccuullttuurree, also called ffaarrmmiinngg or hhuussbbaannddrryy, is the cultivation of _a_n_i_m_a_l_s,
_p_l_a_n_t_s, _f_u_n_g_i, and other life forms for _f_o_o_d, _f_i_b_e_r, _b_i_o_f_u_e_l, _d_r_u_g_s and other
products used to sustain and enhance human life._[_1_] Agriculture was the key
development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of
_d_o_m_e_s_t_i_c_a_t_e_d species created food _s_u_r_p_l_u_s_e_s that nurtured the development of
_c_i_v_i_l_i_z_a_t_i_o_n. The study of agriculture is known as _a_g_r_i_c_u_l_t_u_r_a_l_ _s_c_i_e_n_c_e. The
_h_i_s_t_o_r_y_ _o_f_ _a_g_r_i_c_u_l_t_u_r_e dates back thousands of years, and its development has
been driven and defined by greatly different _c_l_i_m_a_t_e_s, cultures, and
technologies. However, all farming generally relies on techniques to expand and
maintain the lands that are suitable for raising domesticated species. For
plants, this usually requires some form of _i_r_r_i_g_a_t_i_o_n, although there are
methods of _d_r_y_l_a_n_d_ _f_a_r_m_i_n_g; _p_a_s_t_o_r_a_l herding on _r_a_n_g_e_l_a_n_d is still the most
common means of raising livestock. In the developed world, _i_n_d_u_s_t_r_i_a_l
_a_g_r_i_c_u_l_t_u_r_e based on large-scale _m_o_n_o_c_u_l_t_u_r_e has become the dominant system of
modern farming, although there is growing support for _s_u_s_t_a_i_n_a_b_l_e_ _a_g_r_i_c_u_l_t_u_r_e
(e.g. _p_e_r_m_a_c_u_l_t_u_r_e or _o_r_g_a_n_i_c_ _a_g_r_i_c_u_l_t_u_r_e).
Until the _I_n_d_u_s_t_r_i_a_l_ _R_e_v_o_l_u_t_i_o_n, the vast majority of the human population
labored in agriculture. Pre-industrial agriculture was typically _s_u_b_s_i_s_t_e_n_c_e
_a_g_r_i_c_u_l_t_u_r_e in which farmers raised most of their crops for their own
consumption instead of for trade. A remarkable shift in agricultural practices
has occurred over the past century in response to new technologies, and the
development of world markets. This also led to technological improvements in
agricultural techniques, such as the _H_a_b_e_r_-_B_o_s_c_h method for synthesizing
_a_m_m_o_n_i_u_m_ _n_i_t_r_a_t_e which made the traditional practice of recycling _n_u_t_r_i_e_n_t_s
with _c_r_o_p_ _r_o_t_a_t_i_o_n and animal _m_a_n_u_r_e less necessary.
Modern _a_g_r_o_n_o_m_y, _p_l_a_n_t_ _b_r_e_e_d_i_n_g, _a_g_r_o_c_h_e_m_i_c_a_l_s such as _p_e_s_t_i_c_i_d_e_s and
_f_e_r_t_i_l_i_z_e_r_s, and technological improvements have sharply increased yields from
cultivation, but at the same time have caused widespread ecological damage and
negative human health effects. _S_e_l_e_c_t_i_v_e_ _b_r_e_e_d_i_n_g and modern practices in
animal husbandry have similarly increased the output of meat, but have raised
concerns about _a_n_i_m_a_l_ _w_e_l_f_a_r_e and the health effects of the _a_n_t_i_b_i_o_t_i_c_s, _g_r_o_w_t_h
_h_o_r_m_o_n_e_s, and other chemicals commonly used in industrial meat production.
_G_e_n_e_t_i_c_a_l_l_y_ _M_o_d_i_f_i_e_d_ _O_r_g_a_n_i_s_m_s are an increasing component of agriculture
today, although they are banned in several countries. Agricultural food
production and water management is targeted as an increasingly global issue
that is fostering debate on a number of issues. Significant degradation of land
and water resources, including the depletion of _a_q_u_i_f_e_r_s, has been seen in
recent decades, and the effects of global warming on agriculture and of
agriculture on global warming are still not fully known.
The major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods, fibers,
_f_u_e_l_s, and _r_a_w_ _m_a_t_e_r_i_a_l_s. Specific foods include _c_e_r_e_a_l_s (grains), _v_e_g_e_t_a_b_l_e_s,
_f_r_u_i_t_s, _o_i_l_s, _m_e_a_t and _s_p_i_c_e_s. Fibers include _c_o_t_t_o_n, _w_o_o_l, _h_e_m_p, _s_i_l_k and
_f_l_a_x. Raw materials include _l_u_m_b_e_r and _b_a_m_b_o_o. Other useful materials are
produced by plants, such as _r_e_s_i_n_s, _d_y_e_s, _d_r_u_g_s, _p_e_r_f_u_m_e, _b_i_o_f_u_e_l_s and
ornamental products such as _c_u_t_ _f_l_o_w_e_r_s and _n_u_r_s_e_r_y_ _p_l_a_n_t_s. Over one third of
the world's workers are employed in agriculture, second only to the services
sector, although the percentages of agricultural workers in developed countries
has decreased significantly over the past several centuries.

The word agriculture is a late _M_i_d_d_l_e_ _E_n_g_l_i_s_h adaptation of Latin agricultÅ«ra,
from ager, "field", and cultÅ«ra, "_c_u_l_t_i_v_a_t_i_o_n" or "growing"._[_2_] Agriculture
usually refers to human activities, although it is also observed in certain
species of _a_n_t, _t_e_r_m_i_t_e and _a_m_b_r_o_s_i_a_ _b_e_e_t_l_e._[_3_] To practice agriculture means

food, fiber, forest products, horticultural crops, and their related services."

distinction is sometimes made between forestry and agriculture, based on the
former's longer management rotations, extensive versus intensive management
practices and development mainly by nature, rather than by man. Even then, it
is acknowledged that there is a large amount of knowledge transfer and overlap
between _s_i_l_v_i_c_u_l_t_u_r_e (the management of forests) and agriculture._[_5_] In

cultures, which allowed the growth of towns and cities, and the complex
societies we call _c_i_v_i_l_i_z_a_t_i_o_n_s. When farmers became capable of producing food
beyond the needs of their own families, others in their society were freed to
devote themselves to projects other than food acquisition. Historians and
anthropologists have long argued that the development of agriculture made
civilization possible. The total _w_o_r_l_d_ _p_o_p_u_l_a_t_i_o_n probably never exceeded 15
million inhabitants before the development of agriculture._[_7_] According to
_J_a_r_e_d_ _D_i_a_m_o_n_d, the costs of agriculture were: "the average daily number of work
hours increased, nutrition deteriorated, infectious disease and body wear
increased, and lifespan shortened."_[_8_]

starting the Neolithic Revolution. Between 10,000 and 13,000 years ago, the
ancestors of modern cattle, sheep, goats and pigs were domesticated in this
area. The gradual transition from wild harvesting to deliberate cultivation
happened independently in several areas around the globe._[_1_1_] Agriculture
allowed for the support of an increased population, leading to larger societies
and eventually the development of cities. It also created the need for greater
organization of political power (and the creation of _s_o_c_i_a_l_ _s_t_r_a_t_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n), as
decisions had to be made regarding labor and harvest allocation and access
rights to water and land. Agriculture bred immobility, as populations settled
down for long periods of time, which led to the accumulation of material goods.
_[_1_2_]
Early _N_e_o_l_i_t_h_i_c villages show evidence of the ability to process grain, and the
Near East is the ancient home of the ancestors of _w_h_e_a_t, _b_a_r_l_e_y and _p_e_a_s. There
is evidence of the cultivation of _f_i_g_s in the _J_o_r_d_a_n_ _V_a_l_l_e_y as long as 11,300
years ago, and _c_e_r_e_a_l (grain) production in Syria approximately 9,000 years
ago. During the same period, farmers in China began to farm _r_i_c_e and _m_i_l_l_e_t,
using man-made floods and fires as part of their cultivation regimen._[_1_1_] Fiber
crops were domesticated as early as food crops, with China domesticating _h_e_m_p,
_c_o_t_t_o_n being developed independently in Africa and South America and the Near
East domesticating _f_l_a_x._[_1_3_] The use of soil amendments, including manure,
fish, compost and ashes, appears to have begun early, and developed
independently in several areas of the world, including _M_e_s_o_p_o_t_a_m_i_a, the _N_i_l_e
_V_a_l_l_e_y and eastern Asia._[_1_4_]
Roman harvesting machine
_S_q_u_a_s_h was grown in Mexico nearly 10,000 years ago, while maize-like plants,
derived from the wild _t_e_o_s_i_n_t_e, began to be seen at around 9,000 years ago. The
derivation of teosinte into modern corn was slow, however, and it took until
5,500_[_1_1_] to 6,000 years ago to turn into what we know today as maize. It then
gradually spread across North America and was the major crop of Native
Americans at the time of European exploration._[_1_5_] _B_e_a_n_s were domesticated
around the same time, and together these three plants formed the _T_h_r_e_e_ _S_i_s_t_e_r_s
nutritional foundation of many native populations in North and Central America.
Combined with peppers, these crops provided a balanced diet for much of the
continent._[_1_6_] _G_r_a_p_e_s were first grown for _w_i_n_e approximately 8,000 years ago,
in the _S_o_u_t_h_e_r_n_ _C_a_u_c_a_s_u_s, and by 3000 BC had spread to the Fertile Crescent,
the Jordan Valley and Egypt._[_1_7_]
Agriculture advanced to Europe slightly later, reaching the northeast of the
continent from the east around 4000 BC. The idea that agriculture spread to
Europe, rather than independently developing there, has led to two main
hypotheses. The first is a "wave of advance", which holds that agriculture
traveled slowly and steadily across the continent, while the second,
"population pulse" theory, holds that it moved in jumps._[_1_8_] Also around 6000
years ago, horses first began to be domesticated in the Eurasian _s_t_e_p_p_e_s.
Initially used for food, it was quickly discovered that they were useful for
field work and carrying goods and people._[_1_9_] Around 5,000 years ago,

Between 2500 and 2000 BC, the simplest form of the _p_l_o_u_g_h, called the _a_r_d,
spread throughout Europe, replacing the _h_o_e. This change in equipment
significantly increased cultivation ability, and affected the demand for land,
as well as ideas about property, inheritance and family rights._[_2_1_] Before this
period, simple _d_i_g_g_i_n_g_ _s_t_i_c_k_s or hoes were used. These tools would have also
been easier to transport, which was a benefit as people only stayed until the
soil's nutrients were depleted. However, as the continuous cultivating of
smaller pieces of land became a sustaining practice throughout the world, ards
were much more efficient than digging sticks._[_2_2_] As humanity became more
stationary, empires, such as the _N_e_w_ _K_i_n_g_d_o_m_ _o_f_ _E_g_y_p_t and the _A_n_c_i_e_n_t_ _R_o_m_a_n_s,
arose, dependent upon agriculture to feed their growing populations, and
slavery, which was used to provide the labor needed for continually
intensifying agricultural processes. Agricultural technology continued to
improve, allowing the expansion of available crop varieties, including a wide
range of fruits, vegetables, oil crops, spices and other products._[_2_3_]_[_2_4_]
China was also an important center for agricultural technology development
during this period. During the _Z_h_o_u_ _d_y_n_a_s_t_y (1666-221 BC), the first canals
were built, and irrigation was used extensively. The later _T_h_r_e_e_ _K_i_n_g_d_o_m_s and
_N_o_r_t_h_e_r_n and _S_o_u_t_h_e_r_n_ _d_y_n_a_s_t_i_e_s (221-581 AD) brought the first biological pest
control, extensive writings on agricultural topics and technological
innovations such as steel and the _w_h_e_e_l_b_a_r_r_o_w._[_2_5_]
In the ancient world, fresh products, such as meats, dairy products and fresh
fruits and vegetables, were likely consumed relatively close to where they were
produced. Less perishable products, such as grains, preserved foods, olive oil
and wine, were often traded over an extensive network of land and sea routes.
The ancient trade in agricultural goods was well established, with wine traded
in the Mediterranean region in the 6th century BC and Rome receiving extensive
shipments of grain as tax payments by the 2nd century BC. Huge amounts of grain
were transported, mainly by sea, and it was during this period that the
subsidization of grain farming began, for the prevention of famine. Ancient
Rome was a major center for agricultural trade. Trade routes stretched from
Britain and Scandinavia in the west to India and China in the east, and
included major crops, such as grain, wine and olive oil, as well as additional
products, including spices, fabrics and drugs._[_2_6_]
During the time of the _G_r_e_c_o_-_R_o_m_a_n_s, scholars, including _P_l_a_t_o (428-348 BC) and
_A_r_i_s_t_o_t_l_e (384-322 BC), documented farming techniques, including the use of
fertilizers. Much of what scholars believed about farming and plant nutrition
at this time was later found to be incorrect, but their theories provided the
scientific foundation for the development of agricultural theories through the
_M_i_d_d_l_e_ _A_g_e_s. Ideas about soil fertility and fertilization remained much the
same from the time of Greco-Roman scholars until the 19th century, with
correspondingly low crop yields._[_1_4_] By the time of _A_l_e_x_a_n_d_e_r_ _t_h_e_ _G_r_e_a_t's
conquests (330-323 BC), the role of horses had developed, and they played a
huge role in warfare and agriculture. Innovations continued to be developed
which allowed them to work longer, harder and more efficiently. By medieval
times they became the primary source of power for agriculture, transport and
warfare, a position they held until the development of the _s_t_e_a_m and _i_n_t_e_r_n_a_l
_c_o_m_b_u_s_t_i_o_n engines._[_1_9_] The _M_a_y_a_n culture developed several innovations in
agriculture during its peak, which ranged from 400 BC to 900 AD and was heavily
dependent upon agriculture to support its population. The Mayans used extensive
canal and raised field systems to farm the large portions of swampland on the

The Middle Ages saw significant improvements in the agricultural techniques and
technology. During this time period, monasteries spread throughout Europe and
became important centers for the collection of knowledge related to agriculture
and forestry. The _m_a_n_o_r_i_a_l_ _s_y_s_t_e_m, which existed under different names
throughout Europe and Asia, allowed large landowners significant control over
both their land and its laborers, in the form of peasants or _s_e_r_f_s._[_2_9_] During
the medieval period, the _A_r_a_b_ _w_o_r_l_d was critical in the exchange of crops and
technology between the European, Asia and African continents. Besides
transporting numerous crops, they introduced the concept of summer irrigation
to Europe and developed the beginnings of the _p_l_a_n_t_a_t_i_o_n system through the use
of slaves for intensive cultivation._[_3_0_]
By 900 AD in Europe, developments in _i_r_o_n_ _s_m_e_l_t_i_n_g allowed for increased
production, leading to developments in the production of agricultural
implements such as ploughs, hand tools and _h_o_r_s_e_ _s_h_o_e_s. The plough was
significantly improved, developing into the _m_o_u_l_d_b_o_a_r_d_ _p_l_o_u_g_h, capable of
turning over the heavy, wet soils of northern Europe. This led to the clearing
of forests in that area and a significant increase in agricultural production,
which in turn led to an increase in population._[_3_1_] A similar plough, which may
have developed independently, was also found in China as early as the 9th
century._[_3_2_] At the same time, farmers in Europe moved from a two field _c_r_o_p
_r_o_t_a_t_i_o_n to a three field crop rotation in which one field of three was left
fallow every year. This resulted in increased productivity and nutrition, as
the change in rotations led to different crops being planted, including _l_e_g_u_m_e_s
such as peas, lentils and beans. Inventions such as improved _h_o_r_s_e_ _h_a_r_n_e_s_s_e_s
and the _w_h_i_p_p_l_e_t_r_e_e also changed methods of cultivation._[_3_1_] _W_a_t_e_r_m_i_l_l_s were
initially developed by the Romans, but were improved throughout the Middle
Ages, along with _w_i_n_d_m_i_l_l_s, and used to grind grains into flour, cut wood and
process flax and wool, among other uses._[_3_3_]
Crops included wheat, _r_y_e, barley and _o_a_t_s. Peas, beans, and _v_e_t_c_h_e_s became
common from the 13th century onward as a _f_o_d_d_e_r_ _c_r_o_p for animals and also for
their _n_i_t_r_o_g_e_n_-_f_i_x_a_t_i_o_n fertilizing properties. Crop yields peaked in the 13th
century, and stayed more or less steady until the 18th century._[_3_4_] Though the
limitations of medieval farming were once thought to have provided a ceiling
for the population growth in the Middle Ages, recent studies_[_3_5_]_[_3_6_] have shown
that the technology of medieval agriculture was always sufficient for the needs
of the people under normal circumstances, and that it was only during
exceptionally harsh times, such as the _t_e_r_r_i_b_l_e_ _w_e_a_t_h_e_r_ _o_f_ _1_3_1_5_â___1_7, that the
needs of the population could not be met._[_3_7_] The _M_e_d_i_e_v_a_l_ _W_a_r_m_ _P_e_r_i_o_d, between
900-1300 AD, brought generally warmer global temperatures, leading to increased
harvests throughout Europe and a greater northern range for subtropical crops
such as _f_i_g_s and olives. _G_r_e_e_n_l_a_n_d and _I_c_e_l_a_n_d were settled by Europeans during
this period, and supported agricultural activities. The long-term warming
period is generally thought to have occurred mainly in Europe, but other areas
of the world experienced shorter warming periods at different times during this
period, including China in the 11th and 12th centuries, with similar effects on
agriculture. The climate variations found in Europe during the Medieval Warm
Period returned to more moderate levels in the 15th century, and terminated in
the _L_i_t_t_l_e_ _I_c_e_ _A_g_e of the 16th-mid 19th centuries._[_3_8_]

After 1492, a _g_l_o_b_a_l_ _e_x_c_h_a_n_g_e of previously local crops and livestock breeds
occurred. Key crops involved in this exchange included _m_a_i_z_e, potatoes, _s_w_e_e_t
_p_o_t_a_t_o_e_s and _m_a_n_i_o_c traveling from the New World to the Old, and several
varieties of wheat, barley, rice and _t_u_r_n_i_p_s going from the Old World to the
New. There were very few livestock species in the New World, with horses,
cattle, sheep and goats being completely unknown before their arrival with Old
World settlers. Crops moving in both directions across the _A_t_l_a_n_t_i_c_ _O_c_e_a_n
caused population growth around the world, and had a lasting effect on many
cultures._[_3_9_] Since being introduced by Portuguese in the 16th century,_[_4_0_]
maize and manioc have replaced traditional African crops as the continent's
most important staple food crops._[_4_1_]
After its introduction from South America to Spain in the late 1500s, the
potato became an important staple crop throughout Europe by the late 1700s. The
potato allowed farmers to produce more food, and initially added variety to the
European diet. The nutrition boost caused by increased potato consumption
resulted in lower disease rates, higher birth rates and lower mortality rates,
causing a population boom throughout the _B_r_i_t_i_s_h_ _E_m_p_i_r_e, the US and Europe._[_4_2_]
The introduction of the potato also brought about the first intensive use of

dependence on grain caused repetitive regional and national famines when the
crops failed: 17 major famines in England alone between 1523 and 1623. Although
initially almost eliminating the danger of famine, the resulting dependence on
the potato eventually caused the _E_u_r_o_p_e_a_n_ _P_o_t_a_t_o_ _F_a_i_l_u_r_e, a disastrous crop

By the early 19th century, agricultural techniques, implements, seed stocks and
_c_u_l_t_i_v_a_r_s had so improved that yield per land unit was many times that seen in
the Middle Ages. The work of _C_h_a_r_l_e_s_ _D_a_r_w_i_n and _G_r_e_g_o_r_ _M_e_n_d_e_l created the
scientific foundation for plant breeding that led to its explosive impact over
the past 150 years._[_4_4_] The development of agriculture into its modern form has
been possible through a continuing process of _m_e_c_h_a_n_i_z_a_t_i_o_n, with huge advances
made starting in the early 19th century. Horse drawn machinery, such as the
_M_c_C_o_r_m_i_c_k_ _r_e_a_p_e_r, revolutionized harvesting, while inventions such as the
_c_o_t_t_o_n_ _g_i_n made possible the processing of large amounts of crops. During this
same period, farmers experimented with steam-powered machinery, which was found
to be expensive, dangerous and a fire hazard. In 1892, the first gasoline-
powered tractor was successfully developed, and in 1923, the _I_n_t_e_r_n_a_t_i_o_n_a_l
_H_a_r_v_e_s_t_e_r _F_a_r_m_a_l_l tractor became the first all-purpose tractor, and marked a
major point in the replacement of draft animals (particularly horses) with
machines. Since that time, self-propelled mechanical harvesters (_c_o_m_b_i_n_e_s),
planters, transplanters and other equipment have been developed, further
revolutionizing agriculture._[_4_5_] These inventions allowed farming tasks to be
done with a speed and on a scale previously impossible, leading modern farms to
output much greater volumes of high-quality produce per land unit._[_4_6_]
In 1909 the _H_a_b_e_r_-_B_o_s_c_h method to synthesize _a_m_m_o_n_i_u_m_ _n_i_t_r_a_t_e was first
demonstrated; it represented a major breakthrough and allowed _c_r_o_p_ _y_i_e_l_d_s to
overcome previous constraints. In the years after _W_o_r_l_d_ _W_a_r_ _I_I, the use of
synthetic fertilizer increased rapidly, in sync with the increasing world
population._[_4_7_] In the past century agriculture has been characterized by
increased productivity, the substitution of synthetic fertilizers and
pesticides for labor, _w_a_t_e_r_ _p_o_l_l_u_t_i_o_n, and _f_a_r_m_ _s_u_b_s_i_d_i_e_s. In recent years
there has been a backlash against the _e_x_t_e_r_n_a_l environmental effects of
conventional agriculture, resulting in the _o_r_g_a_n_i_c_ _m_o_v_e_m_e_n_t._[_4_8_] Famines
continued to sweep the globe through the 20th century. Through the effects of
climactic events, government policy, war and crop failure, millions of people
died in each of at least ten famines between the 1920s and the 1990s._[_4_9_]
The cereals rice, corn, and wheat provide 60% of human food supply._[_5_0_] Between
1700 and 1980, "the total area of cultivated land worldwide increased 466%" and
yields increased dramatically, particularly because of _s_e_l_e_c_t_i_v_e_l_y_ _b_r_e_d high-
yielding varieties, fertilizers, pesticides, irrigation, and machinery._[_5_0_]
However, concerns have been raised over the _s_u_s_t_a_i_n_a_b_i_l_i_t_y of intensive
agriculture. Intensive agriculture has become associated with decreased soil
quality in India and Asia, and there has been increased concern over the
effects of fertilizers and pesticides on the environment, particularly as
population increases and food demand expands. The monocultures typically used
in intensive agriculture increase the number of pests, which are controlled
through pesticides. _I_n_t_e_g_r_a_t_e_d_ _p_e_s_t_ _m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t (IPM), which "has been promoted
for decades and has had some notable successes" has not significantly affected
the use of pesticides because policies encourage the use of pesticides and IPM
is knowledge-intensive._[_5_0_]
Since the late 19th century, agricultural exploration expeditions have been
mounted to find new species and new agricultural practices in different areas
of the world. Two early American examples of expeditions include Frank N.
Meyer's fruit- and nut-collecting trip to China and Japan from 1916 to 1918_[_5_1_]
and the Dorsett-Morse Oriental Agricultural Exploration Expedition to China,
Japan, and Korea from 1929 to 1931 to collect soybean germplasm to support the

_N_o_r_m_a_n_ _B_o_r_l_a_u_g, father of the Green Revolution, is often credited with saving
over a billion people worldwide from starvation.
The Green Revolution refers to a series of research, development, and
_t_e_c_h_n_o_l_o_g_y_ _t_r_a_n_s_f_e_r initiatives, occurring between the 1940s and the late
1970s, that increased agriculture production around the world, beginning most
markedly in the late 1960s._[_5_5_] The initiatives, led by _N_o_r_m_a_n_ _B_o_r_l_a_u_g, the
"Father of the Green Revolution" credited with saving over a billion people
from starvation, involved the development of high-yielding varieties of cereal
grains, expansion of irrigation infrastructure, modernization of management
techniques, distribution of hybridized seeds, synthetic fertilizers, and
_p_e_s_t_i_c_i_d_e_s to farmers.
Synthetic nitrogen, along with mined _r_o_c_k_ _p_h_o_s_p_h_a_t_e, pesticides and
mechanization, have greatly increased crop yields in the early 20th century.
Increased supply of _g_r_a_i_n_s has led to cheaper livestock as well. Further,
global yield increases were experienced later in the 20th century when high-
yield varieties of common staple grains such as rice, wheat, and corn were
introduced as a part of the Green Revolution. The Green Revolution exported the
technologies (including pesticides and synthetic nitrogen) of the developed
world to the developing world. _T_h_o_m_a_s_ _M_a_l_t_h_u_s famously predicted that the Earth
would not be able to support its growing population, but technologies such as
the Green Revolution have allowed the world to produce a surplus of food._[_5_6_]
Although the Green Revolution significantly increased rice yields in Asia,
yield increases have not occurred in the past 15â20 years._[_5_7_] The genetic
"yield potential" has increased for wheat, but the yield potential for rice has
not increased since 1966, and the yield potential for maize has "barely
increased in 35 years"._[_5_7_] It takes a decade or two for herbicide-resistant
weeds to emerge, and insects become resistant to insecticides within about a
decade._[_5_7_] Crop rotation helps to prevent resistances._[_5_7_]

In the past century agriculture has been characterized by enhanced
_p_r_o_d_u_c_t_i_v_i_t_y, the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, _s_e_l_e_c_t_i_v_e

_o_r_g_a_n_i_c_ _f_a_r_m_i_n_g such as _S_i_r_ _A_l_b_e_r_t_ _H_o_w_a_r_d argued in the early 20th century that
the overuse of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers damages the long-term
fertility of the soil. While this feeling lay dormant for decades, as
_e_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t_a_l_ _a_w_a_r_e_n_e_s_s has increased in the 21st century there has been a
movement towards _s_u_s_t_a_i_n_a_b_l_e_ _a_g_r_i_c_u_l_t_u_r_e by some farmers, consumers, and
policymakers.
Since the 1990s, there has been a backlash against perceived _e_x_t_e_r_n_a_l
environmental effects of mainstream agriculture, particularly regarding water
pollution,_[_5_8_] resulting in the organic movement. One of the major forces
behind this movement has been the _E_u_r_o_p_e_a_n_ _U_n_i_o_n, which first certified _o_r_g_a_n_i_c
_f_o_o_d in 1991 and began reform of its _C_o_m_m_o_n_ _A_g_r_i_c_u_l_t_u_r_a_l_ _P_o_l_i_c_y (CAP) in 2005
to phase out commodity-linked farm subsidies,_[_5_9_] also known as _d_e_c_o_u_p_l_i_n_g. The
growth of organic farming has renewed research in alternative technologies such

In late 2007, several factors pushed up the price of grains consumed by humans
as well as used to feed poultry and dairy cows and other cattle, causing higher
prices of wheat (up 58%), soybean (up 32%), and maize (up 11%) over the year.
Contributing factors included increased demand for grain-fed animal products
from the growing middle classes of countries such as China and India and the
diversion of food grain to biofuel production._[_6_0_]_[_6_1_] Food _r_i_o_t_s took place in

requiring the input of nutrients (fertilizer or _m_a_n_u_r_e) and some manual _p_e_s_t
_c_o_n_t_r_o_l. Annual cultivation is the next phase of intensity in which there is no
fallow period. This requires even greater nutrient and pest control inputs.
Further industrialization lead to the use of _m_o_n_o_c_u_l_t_u_r_e_s, when one _c_u_l_t_i_v_a_r is
planted on a large acreage. Because of the low _b_i_o_d_i_v_e_r_s_i_t_y, nutrient use is
uniform and pests tend to build up, necessitating the greater use of _p_e_s_t_i_c_i_d_e_s
and fertilizers._[_8_5_] Multiple cropping, in which several crops are grown
sequentially in one year, and _i_n_t_e_r_c_r_o_p_p_i_n_g, when several crops are grown at
the same time are other kinds of annual cropping systems known as _p_o_l_y_c_u_l_t_u_r_e_s.
_[_8_6_]
In _s_u_b_t_r_o_p_i_c_a_l and _a_r_i_d environments, the timing and extent of agriculture may
be limited by rainfall, either not allowing multiple annual crops in a year, or
requiring _i_r_r_i_g_a_t_i_o_n. In all of these environments perennial crops are grown
(coffee, chocolate) and systems are practiced such as _a_g_r_o_f_o_r_e_s_t_r_y. In
_t_e_m_p_e_r_a_t_e environments, where ecosystems were predominantly _g_r_a_s_s_l_a_n_d or
_p_r_a_i_r_i_e, highly productive annual cropping is the dominant farming system._[_8_6_]
The last century has seen the _i_n_t_e_n_s_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n, _c_o_n_c_e_n_t_r_a_t_i_o_n and _s_p_e_c_i_a_l_i_z_a_t_i_o_n
of agriculture, relying upon new technologies of agricultural chemicals

_G_M_O_'_s). In the past few decades, a move towards _s_u_s_t_a_i_n_a_b_i_l_i_t_y_ _i_n_ _a_g_r_i_c_u_l_t_u_r_e
has also developed, integrating ideas of socio-economic justice and
conservation of resources and the environment within a farming system._[_8_7_]_[_8_8_]
This has led to the development of many responses to the conventional

animal products (like milk, _e_g_g_s, or _w_o_o_l) on a continual basis, but also to
the breeding and care of species for work and companionship. Livestock
production systems can be defined based on feed source, as _g_r_a_s_s_l_a_n_d â based,
mixed, and landless._[_9_0_]
Grassland based livestock production relies upon plant material such as
_s_h_r_u_b_l_a_n_d, _r_a_n_g_e_l_a_n_d, and _p_a_s_t_u_r_e_s for feeding _r_u_m_i_n_a_n_t animals. Outside
nutrient inputs may be used, however manure is returned directly to the
grassland as a major nutrient source. This system is particularly important in
areas where crop production is not feasible because of climate or soil,
representing 30â40 million pastoralists._[_8_6_] Mixed production systems use
grassland, _f_o_d_d_e_r crops and grain feed crops as feed for ruminant and
monogastic (one stomach; mainly chickens and pigs) livestock. Manure is
typically recycled in mixed systems as a fertilizer for crops. Approximately
68% of all agricultural land is permanent pastures used in the production of
livestock._[_9_1_]
Landless systems rely upon feed from outside the farm, representing the de-
linking of crop and livestock production found more prevalently in _O_E_C_D member
countries. In the U.S., 70% of the grain grown is fed to animals on feedlots.
_[_8_6_] Some of the practices used in commercial livestock production, including
the usage of _g_r_o_w_t_h_ _h_o_r_m_o_n_e_s, are controversial._[_9_2_] Synthetic fertilizers are
more heavily relied upon for crop production and manure utilization becomes a

_T_i_l_l_a_g_e is the practice of plowing soil to prepare for planting or for nutrient
incorporation or for pest control. Tillage varies in intensity from
conventional to _n_o_-_t_i_l_l. It may improve productivity by warming the soil,
incorporating fertilizer and controlling weeds, but also renders soil more
prone to erosion, triggers the decomposition of organic matter releasing CO2,
and reduces the abundance and diversity of soil organisms._[_9_3_]_[_9_4_]

Crop alteration has been practiced by humankind for thousands of years, since
the beginning of civilization. Altering crops through breeding practices
changes the genetic make-up of a plant to develop crops with more beneficial
characteristics for humans, for example, larger fruits or seeds, drought-
tolerance, or resistance to pests. Significant advances in plant breeding
ensued after the work of geneticist Gregor Mendel. His work on dominant and
recessive alleles, although initially largely ignored for almost 50 years, gave
plant breeders a better understanding of genetics and breeding techniques. Crop
breeding includes techniques such as plant selection with desirable traits,
self-pollination and cross-pollination, and molecular techniques that
genetically modify the organism._[_1_0_1_]
Domestication of plants has, over the centuries increased yield, improved
_d_i_s_e_a_s_e_ _r_e_s_i_s_t_a_n_c_e and _d_r_o_u_g_h_t_ _t_o_l_e_r_a_n_c_e, eased harvest and improved the taste
and nutritional value of crop plants. Careful selection and breeding have had
enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants. Plant selection and
breeding in the 1920s and 1930s improved pasture (grasses and clover) in New
Zealand. Extensive X-ray and ultraviolet induced mutagenesis efforts (i.e.
primitive genetic engineering) during the 1950s produced the modern commercial
varieties of grains such as wheat, corn (maize) and barley._[_1_0_2_]_[_1_0_3_]
The _G_r_e_e_n_ _R_e_v_o_l_u_t_i_o_n popularized the use of conventional _h_y_b_r_i_d_i_z_a_t_i_o_n to
increase yield many folds by creating "high-yielding varieties". For example,
average yields of corn (maize) in the USA have increased from around 2.5 tons
per hectare (t/ha) (40 bushels per acre) in 1900 to about 9.4 t/ha (150 bushels
per acre) in 2001. Similarly, worldwide average wheat yields have increased
from less than 1 t/ha in 1900 to more than 2.5 t/ha in 1990. South American
average wheat yields are around 2 t/ha, African under 1 t/ha, Egypt and Arabia
up to 3.5 to 4 t/ha with irrigation. In contrast, the average wheat yield in
countries such as France is over 8 t/ha. Variations in yields are due mainly to
variation in climate, genetics, and the level of intensive farming techniques
(use of fertilizers, chemical _p_e_s_t_ _c_o_n_t_r_o_l, growth control to avoid lodging).

concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import

over potential health issues, declining agricultural diversity and
contamination of non-GMO crops._[_1_0_8_] Currently a global treaty, the _B_i_o_s_a_f_e_t_y
_P_r_o_t_o_c_o_l, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding

Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the
plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including _g_l_y_p_h_o_s_a_t_e_s. These seeds
allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control
weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by
farmers worldwide._[_1_1_0_] With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops,
comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some
areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to
other herbicides._[_1_1_1_]_[_1_1_2_] Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage
to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a
nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.
_[_1_1_3_]
Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a
gene from the soil bacterium _B_a_c_i_l_l_u_s_ _t_h_u_r_i_n_g_i_e_n_s_i_s (Bt), which produces a
toxin specific to insects. These crops protect plants from damage by insects.
_[_1_1_4_] Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be
acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various
pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination with wild
species. In some cases, wild species are the primary source of resistance

Agriculture imposes _e_x_t_e_r_n_a_l_ _c_o_s_t_s upon society through pesticides, nutrient
runoff, excessive water usage, and assorted other problems. A 2000 assessment
of agriculture in the UK determined total _e_x_t_e_r_n_a_l_ _c_o_s_t_s for 1996 of Â£2,343
million, or Â£208 per hectare._[_1_1_6_] A 2005 analysis of these costs in the USA
concluded that cropland imposes approximately $5 to 16 billion ($30 to $96 per
hectare), while livestock production imposes $714 million._[_1_1_7_] Both studies,
which focused solely on the fiscal impacts, concluded that more should be done
to internalize external costs. Neither included subsidies in their analysis,
but they noted that subsidies also influence the cost of agriculture to
society._[_1_1_6_]_[_1_1_7_] In 2010, the _I_n_t_e_r_n_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _R_e_s_o_u_r_c_e_ _P_a_n_e_l of the _U_n_i_t_e_d

A senior UN official and co-author of a UN report detailing this problem,
Henning Steinfeld, said "Livestock are one of the most significant contributors
to today's most serious environmental problems"._[_1_1_9_] Livestock production
occupies 70% of all land used for agriculture, or 30% of the land surface of
the planet. It is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases, responsible
for 18% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions as measured in CO2 equivalents.
By comparison, all transportation emits 13.5% of the CO2. It produces 65% of
human-related nitrous oxide (which has 296 times the global warming potential
of CO2,) and 37% of all human-induced methane (which is 23 times as warming as
CO2.) It also generates 64% of the ammonia emission. Livestock expansion is
cited as a key factor driving deforestation, in the Amazon basin 70% of
previously forested area is now occupied by pastures and the remainder used for
feedcrops._[_1_2_0_] Through deforestation and land degradation, livestock is also
driving reductions in biodiversity.

Land transformation, the use of land to yield goods and services, is the most
substantial way humans alter the Earth's ecosystems, and is considered the

24% of land worldwide, with cropland overrepresented._[_1_2_2_] The UN-FAO report
cites land management as the driving factor behind degradation and reports that
1.5 billion people rely upon the degrading land. Degradation can be

Agriculture accounts for 70 per cent of withdrawals of freshwater resources.
_[_1_2_4_] Agriculture is a major draw on water from _a_q_u_i_f_e_r_s, and currently draws
from these underground water sources at an unsustainable rate. It is long known
that aquifers in areas as diverse as northern China, the _U_p_p_e_r_ _G_a_n_g_e_s and the
western US are being depleted, and new research extends these problems to
aquifers in Iran, Mexico and Saudi Arabian._[_1_2_5_] Increasing pressure is being
placed on water resources by industry and urban areas, meaning that _w_a_t_e_r
_s_c_a_r_c_i_t_y is increasing and agriculture is facing the challenge of producing
more food for the world's growing population with fewer water resources._[_1_2_6_]
Agricultural water usage can also cause major environmental problems, including
the destruction of natural wetlands, the spread of water-borne diseases, and
land degradation through salinization and waterlogging, when irrigation is
performed incorrectly._[_1_2_7_]

Pesticide use has increased since 1950 to 2.5 million tons annually worldwide,
yet crop loss from pests has remained relatively constant._[_1_2_8_] The World
Health Organization estimated in 1992 that 3 million pesticide poisonings occur
annually, causing 220,000 deaths._[_1_2_9_] Pesticides select for _p_e_s_t_i_c_i_d_e
_r_e_s_i_s_t_a_n_c_e in the pest population, leading to a condition termed the 'pesticide
treadmill' in which pest resistance warrants the development of a new
pesticide._[_1_3_0_]
An alternative argument is that the way to 'save the environment' and prevent
famine is by using pesticides and intensive high yield farming, a view
exemplified by a quote heading the Center for Global Food Issues website:
'Growing more per acre leaves more land for nature'._[_1_3_1_]_[_1_3_2_] However, critics
argue that a trade-off between the environment and a need for food is not

interaction of these elements._[_8_6_] Extreme events, such as droughts and floods,
are forecast to increase as climate change takes hold._[_1_3_4_] Agriculture is
among sectors most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change; water supply
for example, will be critical to sustain agricultural production and provide
the increase in food output required to sustain the world's growing population.
Fluctuations in the flow of rivers are likely to increase in the twenty first
century. Based on the experience of countries in the Nile river basin
(Ethiopia, Kenya and Sudan) and other developing countries, depletion of water
resources during seasons crucial for agriculture can lead to a decline in yield
by up to 50 percent._[_1_3_5_] Transformational approaches will be needed to manage
natural resources in the future. For example, policies, practices and tools
promoting climate-smart agriculture will be important, as will better use of
scientific information on climate for assessing risks and vulnerability.
Planners and policy-makers will need to help create suitable policies that
encourage funding for such agricultural transformation._[_1_3_6_]
Agriculture can both mitigate or worsen _g_l_o_b_a_l_ _w_a_r_m_i_n_g. Some of the increase in
CO2 in the _a_t_m_o_s_p_h_e_r_e comes from the _d_e_c_o_m_p_o_s_i_t_i_o_n of _o_r_g_a_n_i_c_ _m_a_t_t_e_r in the
soil, and much of the _m_e_t_h_a_n_e emitted into the atmosphere is caused by the
decomposition of organic matter in wet soils such as _r_i_c_e_ _p_a_d_d_i_e_s,_[_1_3_7_] as well
as the normal digestive activities of farm animals. Further, wet or _a_n_a_e_r_o_b_i_c
soils also lose nitrogen through _d_e_n_i_t_r_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n, releasing the _g_r_e_e_n_h_o_u_s_e

Some major organisations are hailing farming within _a_g_r_o_e_c_o_s_y_s_t_e_m_s as the way
forward for mainstream agriculture. Current farming methods have resulted in
over-stretched water resources, high levels of erosion and reduced soil
fertility. According to a report by the _I_n_t_e_r_n_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _W_a_t_e_r_ _M_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t
_I_n_s_t_i_t_u_t_e and _U_N_E_P,_[_1_3_9_] there is not enough water to continue farming using
current practices; therefore how critical water, land, and _e_c_o_s_y_s_t_e_m resources
are used to boost crop yields must be reconsidered. The report suggested
assigning value to ecosystems, recognizing environmental and livelihood
tradeoffs, and balancing the rights of a variety of users and interests.
Inequities that result when such measures are adopted would need to be
addressed, such as the reallocation of water from poor to rich, the clearing of
land to make way for more productive farmland, or the preservation of a wetland
system that limits fishing rights._[_1_4_0_]
Technological advancements help provide farmers with tools and resources to
make farming more sustainable._[_1_4_1_] New technologies have given rise to
innovations like conservation tillage, a farming process which helps prevent

Agricultural economics relates to the "production, distribution and consumption
of [agricultural] goods and services"._[_1_4_3_] National government policies can
significantly change the economic marketplace for agricultural products, in the
form of taxation, _s_u_b_s_i_d_i_e_s, _t_a_r_i_f_f_s and other measures._[_1_4_4_] Since at least
the 1960s, a combination of import/export restrictions, _e_x_c_h_a_n_g_e_ _r_a_t_e_ _p_o_l_i_c_i_e_s
and subsidies have affected farmers in both the developing and developed world.
In the 1980s, it was clear that non-subsidized farmers in developing countries
were experiencing adverse affects from national policies that created
artificially low global prices for farm products. Between the mid-1980s and the
early 2000s, several international agreements were put into place that limited
agricultural tariffs, subsidies and other trade restrictions._[_1_4_5_]
However, as of 2009, there was still a significant amount of policy-driven
distortion in global agricultural product prices. The three agricultural
products with the greatest amount of trade distortion were sugar, milk and
rice, mainly due to taxation. Among the _o_i_l_s_e_e_d_s, sesame had the greatest
amount of taxation, but overall, feed grains and oilseeds had much lower levels
of taxation than livestock products. Since the 1980s, policy-driven distortions
have seen a greater decrease among livestock products than crops during the
worldwide reforms in agricultural policy._[_1_4_6_] Despite this progress, certain
crops, such as cotton, still see subsidies in developed countries artificially
deflating global prices, causing hardship in developing countries with non-
subsidized farmers._[_1_4_7_]
In the United States, food costs attributed to _f_o_o_d_ _p_r_o_c_e_s_s_i_n_g, distribution,
and _a_g_r_i_c_u_l_t_u_r_a_l_ _m_a_r_k_e_t_i_n_g have risen while the costs attributed to farming
have declined. This is related to the greater efficiency of farming, combined
with the increased level of value addition (e.g. more highly processed
products) provided by the supply chain. From 1960 to 1980 the farm share was
around 40%, but by 1990 it had declined to 30% and by 1998, 22.2%. _M_a_r_k_e_t
_c_o_n_c_e_n_t_r_a_t_i_o_n has increased in the sector as well, with the top 20 food
manufacturers accounting for half the food-processing value in 1995, over
double that produced in 1954. As of 2000 the top six US supermarket groups had
50% of sales compared to 32% in 1992. Although the total effect of the
increased market concentration is likely increased efficiency, the changes
redistribute _e_c_o_n_o_m_i_c_ _s_u_r_p_l_u_s from producers (farmers) and consumers, and may
have negative implications for rural communities._[_1_4_8_]
In the United States, unprocessed commodities (i.e. corn, soybeans, cows) are
graded to indicate quality. The quality affects the price the producer
receives. Commodities are generally reported by production quantities,
including bushels, heads, pounds, and board feet._[_1_4_9_]

Since the 1940s, agricultural productivity has increased dramatically, due
largely to the increased use of energy-intensive mechanization, fertilizers and
pesticides. The vast majority of this energy input comes from _f_o_s_s_i_l_ _f_u_e_l
sources._[_1_5_0_] Between the 1960â65 measuring cycle and the cycle from 1986 to

reduce agricultural output, causing food shortages._[_1_5_2_]

Modern or industrialized agriculture is dependent on fossil fuels in two
fundamental ways: 1) direct consumption on the farm and 2) indirect consumption
to manufacture inputs used on the farm. Direct consumption includes the use of
lubricants and fuels to operate farm vehicles and machinery; and use of gas,
liquid propane, and electricity to power dryers, pumps, lights, heaters, and
coolers. American farms directly consumed about 1.2 exajoules (1.1 quadrillion
BTU) in 2002, or just over 1 percent of the nation's total energy._[_1_5_2_]
Indirect consumption is mainly oil and natural gas used to manufacture
