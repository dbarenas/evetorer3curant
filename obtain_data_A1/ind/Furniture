FFuurrnniittuurree is the _m_a_s_s_ _n_o_u_n for the movable objects intended to support various
human activities such as seating and sleeping. Furniture is also used to hold
objects at a convenient height for work (as horizontal surfaces above the
ground), or to store things.
Furniture can be a product of design and is considered a form of _d_e_c_o_r_a_t_i_v_e
_a_r_t. In addition to furniture's functional role, it can serve a symbolic or
religious purpose. It can be made from many materials, including metal,
plastic, and wood. Furniture can be made using a variety of _w_o_o_d_w_o_r_k_i_n_g_ _j_o_i_n_t_s
which often reflect the local culture.

Furniture has been a part of the human experience since the development of non-
nomadic cultures. Evidence of furniture survives from the _N_e_o_l_i_t_h_i_c Period and
later in _a_n_t_i_q_u_i_t_y in the form of _p_a_i_n_t_i_n_g_s, such as the wall _M_u_r_a_l_s discovered

village located in _O_r_k_n_e_y. The site dates from 3100‚Äì2500 BC and due to a
shortage of wood in Orkney, the people of Skara Brae were forced to build with
stone, a readily available material that could be worked easily and turned into
items for use within the household. Each _h_o_u_s_e shows a high degree of
sophistication and was equipped with an extensive assortment of stone
furniture, ranging from cupboards, dressers and beds to shelves, stone seats,
and _l_i_m_p_e_t tanks. The stone dresser was regarded as the most important as it
symbolically faces the entrance in each house and is therefore the first item
seen when entering, perhaps displaying symbolic objects, including decorative
artwork such as several Neolithic _C_a_r_v_e_d_ _S_t_o_n_e_ _B_a_l_l_s also found at the site.

The furniture of the _M_i_d_d_l_e_ _A_g_e_s was usually heavy, _o_a_k, and ornamented with
carved designs. Along with the other arts, the Italian _R_e_n_a_i_s_s_a_n_c_e of the
fourteenth and fifteenth century marked a rebirth in design, often inspired by
the _G_r_e_c_o_-_R_o_m_a_n tradition. A similar explosion of design, and renaissance of
culture in general, occurred in Northern Europe, starting in the fifteenth
century. The seventeenth century, in both Southern and Northern Europe, was
characterized by opulent, often gilded _B_a_r_o_q_u_e designs that frequently
incorporated a profusion of vegetal and scrolling ornament. Starting in the
eighteenth century, furniture designs began to develop more rapidly. Although
there were some styles that belonged primarily to one nation, such as
_P_a_l_l_a_d_i_a_n_i_s_m in _G_r_e_a_t_ _B_r_i_t_a_i_n or _L_o_u_i_s_ _Q_u_i_n_z_e in _F_r_e_n_c_h_ _f_u_r_n_i_t_u_r_e, others, such
as the _R_o_c_o_c_o and _N_e_o_c_l_a_s_s_i_c_i_s_m were perpetuated throughout Western Europe.

The furniture maker by Ludwig Deutsch
The nineteenth century is usually defined by concurrent _r_e_v_i_v_a_l_ _s_t_y_l_e_s,
including _G_o_t_h_i_c, Neoclassicism, Rococo, and the _E_a_s_t_H_a_v_e_n_ _M_o_v_e_m_e_n_t. The design
_r_e_f_o_r_m_s of the late century introduced the _A_e_s_t_h_e_t_i_c_ _m_o_v_e_m_e_n_t and the _A_r_t_s_ _a_n_d

This design was in many ways rooted in necessity and emphasizes both form and
materials. Early American chairs and tables are often constructed with turned
spindles and chair backs often constructed with steaming to bend the wood. Wood
choices tend to be deciduous hardwoods with a particular emphasis on the wood
of edible or fruit bearing trees such as Cherry or Walnut.

The first three-quarters of the twentieth century are often seen as the march
towards _M_o_d_e_r_n_i_s_m. _A_r_t_ _D_e_c_o, _D_e_ _S_t_i_j_l, _B_a_u_h_a_u_s, _W_i_e_n_e_r_ _W_e_r_k_s_t_√_§_t_t_e, and _V_i_e_n_n_a
_S_e_c_e_s_s_i_o_n designers all worked to some degree within the Modernist idiom. Born

_M_o_d_e_r_n" style using materials developed during the war including lamenated

Traditional Japanese furniture is well known for its _m_i_n_i_m_a_l_i_s_t style,
extensive use of wood, high-quality craftsmanship and reliance on wood grain
instead of painting or thick lacquer. Japanese chests are known as _T_a_n_s_u, known
