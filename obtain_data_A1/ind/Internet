The IInntteerrnneett is a global system of interconnected _c_o_m_p_u_t_e_r_ _n_e_t_w_o_r_k_s that use
the standard _I_n_t_e_r_n_e_t_ _p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l_ _s_u_i_t_e (TCP/IP) to serve several billion users
worldwide. It is a network of networks that consists of millions of private,
public, academic, business, and government networks, of local to global scope,
that are linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless and optical networking
technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources
and services, such as the inter-linked _h_y_p_e_r_t_e_x_t documents of the _W_o_r_l_d_ _W_i_d_e
_W_e_b (WWW), the _i_n_f_r_a_s_t_r_u_c_t_u_r_e to support email, and _p_e_e_r_-_t_o_-_p_e_e_r networks.
Most traditional communications media including telephone, music, film, and
television are being reshaped or redefined by the Internet, giving birth to new
services such as _v_o_i_c_e_ _o_v_e_r_ _I_n_t_e_r_n_e_t_ _P_r_o_t_o_c_o_l (VoIP) and _I_n_t_e_r_n_e_t_ _P_r_o_t_o_c_o_l
_t_e_l_e_v_i_s_i_o_n (IPTV). Newspaper, book and other print publishing are adapting to
_w_e_b_s_i_t_e technology, or are reshaped into _b_l_o_g_g_i_n_g and _w_e_b_ _f_e_e_d_s. The Internet
has enabled and accelerated new forms of human interactions through _i_n_s_t_a_n_t
_m_e_s_s_a_g_i_n_g, Internet forums, and _s_o_c_i_a_l_ _n_e_t_w_o_r_k_i_n_g. _O_n_l_i_n_e_ _s_h_o_p_p_i_n_g has boomed
both for major retail outlets and small _a_r_t_i_s_a_n_s and traders. _B_u_s_i_n_e_s_s_-_t_o_-
_b_u_s_i_n_e_s_s and _f_i_n_a_n_c_i_a_l_ _s_e_r_v_i_c_e_s on the Internet affect _s_u_p_p_l_y_ _c_h_a_i_n_s across
entire industries.
The origins of the Internet reach back to research commissioned by the _U_n_i_t_e_d
_S_t_a_t_e_s_ _g_o_v_e_r_n_m_e_n_t in the 1960s to build robust, fault-tolerant communication
via computer networks. While this work together with work in the United Kingdom
and France lead to important precursor networks, they were not the Internet.
There is no consensus on the exact date when the modern Internet came into
being, but sometime in the early to mid-1980s is considered reasonable.
The funding of a new U.S. _b_a_c_k_b_o_n_e by the _N_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _S_c_i_e_n_c_e_ _F_o_u_n_d_a_t_i_o_n in the
1980s, as well as private funding for other commercial backbones, led to
worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies, and
the merger of many networks. Though the Internet has been widely used by
_a_c_a_d_e_m_i_a since the _1_9_8_0_s, the _c_o_m_m_e_r_c_i_a_l_i_z_a_t_i_o_n of what was by the 1990s an
international network resulted in its popularization and incorporation into
virtually every aspect of modern human life. As of June 2012_[_u_p_d_a_t_e_], more than
2.4 billion people—over a third of the _w_o_r_l_d_'_s_ _h_u_m_a_n_ _p_o_p_u_l_a_t_i_o_n—have used
the services of the Internet; approximately 100 times more people than were
using it in 1995._[_1_]_[_2_]
The Internet has no centralized governance in either technological
implementation or policies for access and usage; each constituent network sets
its own policies. Only the overreaching definitions of the two principal _n_a_m_e
_s_p_a_c_e_s in the Internet, the _I_n_t_e_r_n_e_t_ _P_r_o_t_o_c_o_l_ _a_d_d_r_e_s_s space and the _D_o_m_a_i_n_ _N_a_m_e
_S_y_s_t_e_m, are directed by a maintainer organization, the _I_n_t_e_r_n_e_t_ _C_o_r_p_o_r_a_t_i_o_n_ _f_o_r

standardization of the core protocols (_I_P_v_4 and _I_P_v_6) is an activity of the

affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by
contributing technical expertise.

The Internet, referring to the specific global system of interconnected _I_P
networks, is a _p_r_o_p_e_r_ _n_o_u_n and written with an initial _c_a_p_i_t_a_l_ _l_e_t_t_e_r. In the
media and common use it is often not capitalized, viz. the internet. Some
guides specify that the word should be capitalized when used as a noun, but not
capitalized when used as a verb or an adjective._[_3_] The Internet is also often
referred to as the Net.
Historically the word internet was used, uncapitalized, as early as 1883 as a
verb and adjective to refer to interconnected motions. Starting in the early
1970s the term internet was used as a shorthand form of the technical term
_i_n_t_e_r_n_e_t_w_o_r_k, the result of interconnecting computer networks with special
gateways or routers. It was also used as a verb meaning to connect together,
especially for networks._[_4_]_[_5_]
The terms Internet and World Wide Web are often used interchangeably in
everyday speech; it is common to speak of "going on the Internet" when invoking
a _w_e_b_ _b_r_o_w_s_e_r to view _w_e_b_ _p_a_g_e_s. However, the Internet is a particular global

is just one of many _s_e_r_v_i_c_e_s running on the Internet. The Web is a collection
of interconnected documents (web pages) and other _w_e_b_ _r_e_s_o_u_r_c_e_s, linked by

implemented on any _i_n_t_r_a_n_e_t, accessible to network users.
_I_n_t_e_r_w_e_b is a mixture of Internet and World Wide Web typically used
sarcastically to parody a technically unsavvy user._[_7_]

1970s using a variety of _p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l_s. The ARPANET in particular led to the
development of protocols for _i_n_t_e_r_n_e_t_w_o_r_k_i_n_g, where multiple separate networks
could be joined together into a network of networks.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]
The first two nodes of what would become the _A_R_P_A_N_E_T were interconnected

In December 1974, _R_F_C_ _6_7_5 – Specification of Internet Transmission Control

TCP/IP network access expanded again in 1986 when the National Science

(ISPs) began to emerge in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The ARPANET was
decommissioned in 1990. The Internet was commercialized in 1995 when NSFNET was
decommissioned, removing the last restrictions on the use of the Internet to
carry commercial traffic._[_1_9_] The Internet started a rapid expansion to Europe

During the late 1990s, it was estimated that traffic on the public Internet
grew by 100 percent per year, while the mean annual growth in the number of
Internet users was thought to be between 20% and 50%._[_2_7_] This growth is often
attributed to the lack of central administration, which allows organic growth
of the network, as well as the non-proprietary open nature of the Internet
protocols, which encourages vendor interoperability and prevents any one
company from exerting too much control over the network._[_2_8_] As of 31 March
2011, the estimated total number of _I_n_t_e_r_n_e_t_ _u_s_e_r_s was 2.095 billion (30.2% of

1% of the information flowing through two-way telecommunication, by 2000 this
figure had grown to 51%, and by 2007 more than 97% of all telecommunicated
information was carried over the Internet._[_3_0_]

As the user data is processed down through the protocol stack, each layer adds
an encapsulation at the sending host. Data is transmitted "over the wire" at
the link level, left to right. The encapsulation stack procedure is reversed by
the receiving host. Intermediate relays remove and add a new link encapsulation
for retransmission, and inspect the IP layer for routing purposes.

The communications infrastructure of the Internet consists of its hardware
components and a system of software layers that control various aspects of the
architecture. While the hardware can often be used to support other software
systems, it is the design and the rigorous standardization process of the
software architecture that characterizes the Internet and provides the
foundation for its scalability and success. The responsibility for the
architectural design of the Internet software systems has been delegated to the
_I_n_t_e_r_n_e_t_ _E_n_g_i_n_e_e_r_i_n_g_ _T_a_s_k_ _F_o_r_c_e (IETF)._[_3_1_] The IETF conducts standard-setting
work groups, open to any individual, about the various aspects of Internet
architecture. Resulting discussions and final standards are published in a
series of publications, each called a _R_e_q_u_e_s_t_ _f_o_r_ _C_o_m_m_e_n_t_s (RFC), freely
available on the IETF web site.
The principal methods of networking that enable the Internet are contained in
specially designated RFCs that constitute the _I_n_t_e_r_n_e_t_ _S_t_a_n_d_a_r_d_s. Other less
rigorous documents are simply informative, experimental, or historical, or
document the best current practices (BCP) when implementing Internet
technologies.
The Internet standards describe a framework known as the _I_n_t_e_r_n_e_t_ _p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l
_s_u_i_t_e. This is a model architecture that divides methods into a layered system
of protocols (_R_F_C_ _1_1_2_2, _R_F_C_ _1_1_2_3). The layers correspond to the environment or
scope in which their services operate. At the top is the _a_p_p_l_i_c_a_t_i_o_n_ _l_a_y_e_r, the
space for the application-specific networking methods used in software
applications, e.g., a web browser program uses the _c_l_i_e_n_t_-_s_e_r_v_e_r application
model and many file-sharing systems use a _p_e_e_r_-_t_o_-_p_e_e_r paradigm. Below this top
layer, the _t_r_a_n_s_p_o_r_t_ _l_a_y_e_r connects applications on different hosts via the
network with appropriate data exchange methods. Underlying these layers are the
core networking technologies, consisting of two layers.
The _i_n_t_e_r_n_e_t_ _l_a_y_e_r enables computers to identify and locate each other via
_I_n_t_e_r_n_e_t_ _P_r_o_t_o_c_o_l_ _(_I_P_)_ _a_d_d_r_e_s_s_e_s, and allows them to connect to one another via
intermediate (transit) networks. Last, at the bottom of the architecture, is a
software layer, the _l_i_n_k_ _l_a_y_e_r, that provides connectivity between hosts on the
same local network link, such as a local area network (_L_A_N) or a _d_i_a_l_-_u_p
_c_o_n_n_e_c_t_i_o_n. The model, also known as _T_C_P_/_I_P, is designed to be independent of
the underlying hardware, which the model therefore does not concern itself with
in any detail. Other models have been developed, such as the _O_p_e_n_ _S_y_s_t_e_m_s
_I_n_t_e_r_c_o_n_n_e_c_t_i_o_n (OSI) model, but they are not compatible in the details of
description or implementation; many similarities exist and the TCP/IP protocols
are usually included in the discussion of OSI networking.
The most prominent component of the Internet model is the Internet Protocol
(IP), which provides addressing systems (_I_P_ _a_d_d_r_e_s_s_e_s) for computers on the
Internet. IP enables internetworking and in essence establishes the Internet
itself. IP Version 4 (_I_P_v_4) is the initial version used on the first generation
of today's Internet and is still in dominant use. It was designed to address up
to ~4.3 billion (109) Internet hosts. However, the explosive growth of the
Internet has led to _I_P_v_4_ _a_d_d_r_e_s_s_ _e_x_h_a_u_s_t_i_o_n, which entered its final stage in
2011,_[_3_2_] when the global address allocation pool was exhausted. A new protocol
version, IPv6, was developed in the mid-1990s, which provides vastly larger
addressing capabilities and more efficient routing of Internet traffic. _I_P_v_6 is
currently in growing _d_e_p_l_o_y_m_e_n_t around the world, since Internet address
registries (_R_I_R_s) began to urge all resource managers to plan rapid adoption
and conversion._[_3_3_]
IPv6 is not interoperable with IPv4. In essence, it establishes a parallel
version of the Internet not directly accessible with IPv4 software. This means
software upgrades or translator facilities are necessary for networking devices
that need to communicate on both networks. Most modern computer operating
systems already support both versions of the Internet Protocol. Network
infrastructures, however, are still lagging in this development. Aside from the
complex array of physical connections that make up its infrastructure, the
Internet is facilitated by bi- or multi-lateral commercial contracts (e.g.,
_p_e_e_r_i_n_g_ _a_g_r_e_e_m_e_n_t_s), and by technical specifications or protocols that describe
how to exchange data over the network. Indeed, the Internet is defined by its
interconnections and routing policies.

Internet packet routing is accomplished among various tiers of Internet service
providers.
_I_n_t_e_r_n_e_t_ _s_e_r_v_i_c_e_ _p_r_o_v_i_d_e_r_s connect customers, which represent the bottom of the
routing hierarchy, to customers of other ISPs via other higher or same-tier
networks. At the top of the routing hierarchy are the _T_i_e_r_ _1_ _n_e_t_w_o_r_k_s, large
telecommunication companies which exchange traffic directly with all other Tier
1 networks via _p_e_e_r_i_n_g agreements. _T_i_e_r_ _2_ _n_e_t_w_o_r_k_s buy _I_n_t_e_r_n_e_t_ _t_r_a_n_s_i_t from
other providers to reach at least some parties on the global Internet, though
they may also engage in peering. An ISP may use a single upstream provider for
connectivity, or implement _m_u_l_t_i_h_o_m_i_n_g to achieve redundancy. _I_n_t_e_r_n_e_t_ _e_x_c_h_a_n_g_e
_p_o_i_n_t_s are major traffic exchanges with physical connections to multiple ISPs.
Computers and routers use _r_o_u_t_i_n_g_ _t_a_b_l_e_s to direct IP packets to the next-hop
router or destination. Routing tables are maintained by manual configuration or
by _r_o_u_t_i_n_g_ _p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l_s. End-nodes typically use a _d_e_f_a_u_l_t_ _r_o_u_t_e that points
toward an ISP providing transit, while ISP routers use the _B_o_r_d_e_r_ _G_a_t_e_w_a_y
_P_r_o_t_o_c_o_l to establish the most efficient routing across the complex connections
of the global Internet.
Large organizations, such as academic institutions, large enterprises, and
governments, may perform the same function as ISPs, engaging in peering and
purchasing transit on behalf of their internal networks. Research networks tend
to interconnect into large subnetworks such as _G_E_A_N_T, _G_L_O_R_I_A_D, _I_n_t_e_r_n_e_t_2, and
the UK's _n_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _r_e_s_e_a_r_c_h_ _a_n_d_ _e_d_u_c_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_t_w_o_r_k, _J_A_N_E_T.

The Internet structure and its usage characteristics have been studied
extensively. It has been determined that both the Internet IP routing structure
and hypertext links of the World Wide Web are examples of _s_c_a_l_e_-_f_r_e_e_ _n_e_t_w_o_r_k_s.
_[_3_4_]
Many computer scientists describe the Internet as a "prime example of a large-
scale, highly engineered, yet highly complex system"._[_3_5_] The Internet is
heterogeneous; for instance, _d_a_t_a_ _t_r_a_n_s_f_e_r_ _r_a_t_e_s and physical characteristics
of connections vary widely. The Internet exhibits "_e_m_e_r_g_e_n_t_ _p_h_e_n_o_m_e_n_a" that
depend on its large-scale organization. For example, data transfer rates
exhibit temporal _s_e_l_f_-_s_i_m_i_l_a_r_i_t_y. The principles of the routing and addressing
methods for traffic in the Internet reach back to their origins in the 1960s
when the eventual scale and popularity of the network could not be anticipated.
_[_3_6_] Thus, the possibility of developing alternative structures is
investigated._[_3_7_] The Internet structure was found to be highly robust_[_3_8_] to
random failures and very vulnerable to high degree attacks._[_3_9_]

body. However, to maintain interoperability, the principal _n_a_m_e_ _s_p_a_c_e_s of the

authority that coordinates the assignment of unique identifiers for use on the
Internet, including _d_o_m_a_i_n_ _n_a_m_e_s, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, application
port numbers in the transport protocols, and many other parameters. Globally
unified name spaces, in which names and numbers are uniquely assigned, are
essential for maintaining the global reach of the Internet. ICANN is governed
by an international board of directors drawn from across the Internet
technical, business, academic, and other non-commercial communities.
ICANN's role in coordinating the assignment of unique identifiers distinguishes
it as perhaps the only central coordinating body for the global Internet. The
government of the United States continues to have a primary role in approving
changes to the _D_N_S_ _r_o_o_t_ _z_o_n_e that lies at the heart of the domain name system.

The Internet allows greater flexibility in working hours and location,
especially with the spread of unmetered high-speed connections. The Internet
can be accessed almost anywhere by numerous means, including through _m_o_b_i_l_e
_I_n_t_e_r_n_e_t_ _d_e_v_i_c_e_s. Mobile phones, _d_a_t_a_c_a_r_d_s, _h_a_n_d_h_e_l_d_ _g_a_m_e_ _c_o_n_s_o_l_e_s and _c_e_l_l_u_l_a_r
_r_o_u_t_e_r_s allow users to connect to the Internet _w_i_r_e_l_e_s_s_l_y. Within the
limitations imposed by small screens and other limited facilities of such
pocket-sized devices, the services of the Internet, including email and the
web, may be available. Service providers may restrict the services offered and
mobile data charges may be significantly higher than other access methods.
Educational material at all levels from pre-school to post-doctoral is
available from websites. Examples range from _C_B_e_e_b_i_e_s, through school and high-
school revision guides and _v_i_r_t_u_a_l_ _u_n_i_v_e_r_s_i_t_i_e_s, to access to top-end scholarly
literature through the likes of _G_o_o_g_l_e_ _S_c_h_o_l_a_r. For _d_i_s_t_a_n_c_e_ _e_d_u_c_a_t_i_o_n, help
with _h_o_m_e_w_o_r_k and other assignments, self-guided learning, whiling away spare
time, or just looking up more detail on an interesting fact, it has never been
easier for people to access educational information at any level from anywhere.
The Internet in general and the _W_o_r_l_d_ _W_i_d_e_ _W_e_b in particular are important
enablers of both _f_o_r_m_a_l and _i_n_f_o_r_m_a_l_ _e_d_u_c_a_t_i_o_n.
The low cost and nearly instantaneous sharing of ideas, knowledge, and skills
has made _c_o_l_l_a_b_o_r_a_t_i_v_e work dramatically easier, with the help of _c_o_l_l_a_b_o_r_a_t_i_v_e
_s_o_f_t_w_a_r_e. Not only can a group cheaply communicate and share ideas but the wide
reach of the Internet allows such groups more easily to form. An example of
this is the _f_r_e_e_ _s_o_f_t_w_a_r_e_ _m_o_v_e_m_e_n_t, which has produced, among other things,
_L_i_n_u_x, _M_o_z_i_l_l_a_ _F_i_r_e_f_o_x, and _O_p_e_n_O_f_f_i_c_e_._o_r_g. Internet chat, whether using an _I_R_C
chat room, an _i_n_s_t_a_n_t_ _m_e_s_s_a_g_i_n_g system, or a _s_o_c_i_a_l_ _n_e_t_w_o_r_k_i_n_g website, allows
colleagues to stay in touch in a very convenient way while working at their
computers during the day. Messages can be exchanged even more quickly and
conveniently than via email. These systems may allow files to be exchanged,
drawings and images to be shared, or voice and video contact between team
members.
_C_o_n_t_e_n_t_ _m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t systems allow collaborating teams to work on shared sets of
documents simultaneously without accidentally destroying each other's work.
Business and project teams can share calendars as well as documents and other
information. Such collaboration occurs in a wide variety of areas including
scientific research, software development, conference planning, political
activism and creative writing. Social and political collaboration is also
becoming more widespread as both Internet access and _c_o_m_p_u_t_e_r_ _l_i_t_e_r_a_c_y spread.
The Internet allows computer users to remotely access other computers and
information stores easily, wherever they may be. They may do this with or
without _c_o_m_p_u_t_e_r_ _s_e_c_u_r_i_t_y, i.e. authentication and encryption technologies,
depending on the requirements. This is encouraging new ways of working from
home, collaboration and information sharing in many industries. An accountant
sitting at home can _a_u_d_i_t the books of a company based in another country, on a
_s_e_r_v_e_r situated in a third country that is remotely maintained by IT
specialists in a fourth. These accounts could have been created by home-working
bookkeepers, in other remote locations, based on information emailed to them
from offices all over the world. Some of these things were possible before the
widespread use of the Internet, but the cost of private _l_e_a_s_e_d_ _l_i_n_e_s would have
made many of them infeasible in practice. An office worker away from their
desk, perhaps on the other side of the world on a business trip or a holiday,
can access their emails, access their data using _c_l_o_u_d_ _c_o_m_p_u_t_i_n_g, or open a
_r_e_m_o_t_e_ _d_e_s_k_t_o_p session into their office PC using a secure _V_i_r_t_u_a_l_ _P_r_i_v_a_t_e
_N_e_t_w_o_r_k (VPN) connection on the Internet. This can give the worker complete
access to all of their normal files and data, including email and other
applications, while away from the office. It has been referred to among _s_y_s_t_e_m
_a_d_m_i_n_i_s_t_r_a_t_o_r_s as the Virtual Private Nightmare,_[_4_1_] because it extends the
secure perimeter of a corporate network into remote locations and its
employees' homes.

symbolically identify services, _s_e_r_v_e_r_s, and other databases, and the documents
and resources that they can provide. _H_y_p_e_r_t_e_x_t_ _T_r_a_n_s_f_e_r_ _P_r_o_t_o_c_o_l (HTTP) is the
main access protocol of the World Wide Web, but it is only one of the hundreds
of communication protocols used on the Internet. _W_e_b_ _s_e_r_v_i_c_e_s also use HTTP to
allow software systems to communicate in order to share and exchange business
logic and data.
World Wide Web browser software, such as Microsoft's _I_n_t_e_r_n_e_t_ _E_x_p_l_o_r_e_r, _M_o_z_i_l_l_a

have easy, instant access to a vast and diverse amount of online information.
Compared to printed media, books, encyclopedias and traditional libraries, the
World Wide Web has enabled the decentralization of information on a large
scale.
The Web has also enabled individuals and organizations to _p_u_b_l_i_s_h ideas and
information to a potentially large _a_u_d_i_e_n_c_e online at greatly reduced expense
and time delay. Publishing a web page, a blog, or building a website involves
little initial _c_o_s_t and many cost-free services are available. Publishing and
maintaining large, professional web sites with attractive, diverse and up-to-
date information is still a difficult and expensive proposition, however. Many
individuals and some companies and groups use web logs or blogs, which are
largely used as easily updatable online diaries. Some commercial organizations
encourage _s_t_a_f_f to communicate advice in their areas of specialization in the
hope that visitors will be impressed by the expert knowledge and free
information, and be attracted to the corporation as a result.
One example of this practice is _M_i_c_r_o_s_o_f_t, whose _p_r_o_d_u_c_t_ _d_e_v_e_l_o_p_e_r_s publish
their personal blogs in order to pique the public's interest in their work.
Collections of personal web pages published by large service providers remain
popular, and have become increasingly sophisticated. Whereas operations such as
_A_n_g_e_l_f_i_r_e and _G_e_o_C_i_t_i_e_s have existed since the early days of the Web, newer
offerings from, for example, Facebook and Twitter currently have large
followings. These operations often brand themselves as _s_o_c_i_a_l_ _n_e_t_w_o_r_k_ _s_e_r_v_i_c_e_s
rather than simply as web page hosts.
_A_d_v_e_r_t_i_s_i_n_g on popular web pages can be lucrative, and _e_-_c_o_m_m_e_r_c_e or the sale
of products and services directly via the Web continues to grow.
When the Web began in the 1990s, a typical web page was stored in completed
form on a web server, formatted in _H_T_M_L, ready to be sent to a user's browser
in response to a request. Over time, the process of creating and serving web
pages has become more automated and more dynamic. Websites are often created
using _c_o_n_t_e_n_t_ _m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t or _w_i_k_i software with, initially, very little content.
Contributors to these systems, who may be paid staff, members of a club or
other organization or members of the public, fill underlying databases with
content using editing pages designed for that purpose, while casual visitors
view and read this content in its final HTML form. There may or may not be
editorial, approval and security systems built into the process of taking newly
entered content and making it available to the target visitors.

Email is an important communications service available on the Internet. The
concept of sending electronic text messages between parties in a way analogous
to mailing letters or memos predates the creation of the Internet. Pictures,
documents and other files are sent as _e_m_a_i_l_ _a_t_t_a_c_h_m_e_n_t_s. Emails can be _c_c_-_e_d to

_I_n_t_e_r_n_e_t_ _t_e_l_e_p_h_o_n_y is another common communications service made possible by
the creation of the Internet. _V_o_I_P stands for Voice-over-_I_n_t_e_r_n_e_t_ _P_r_o_t_o_c_o_l,
referring to the protocol that underlies all Internet communication. The idea
began in the early 1990s with _w_a_l_k_i_e_-_t_a_l_k_i_e-like voice applications for
personal computers. In recent years many VoIP systems have become as easy to
use and as convenient as a normal telephone. The benefit is that, as the
Internet carries the voice traffic, VoIP can be free or cost much less than a
traditional telephone call, especially over long distances and especially for
those with always-on Internet connections such as _c_a_b_l_e or _A_D_S_L. VoIP is
maturing into a competitive alternative to traditional telephone service.
Interoperability between different providers has improved and the ability to
call or receive a call from a traditional telephone is available. Simple,
inexpensive VoIP network adapters are available that eliminate the need for a
personal computer.
Voice quality can still vary from call to call, but is often equal to and can
even exceed that of traditional calls. Remaining problems for VoIP include
_e_m_e_r_g_e_n_c_y_ _t_e_l_e_p_h_o_n_e_ _n_u_m_b_e_r dialing and reliability. Currently, a few VoIP
providers provide an emergency service, but it is not universally available.
Older traditional phones with no "extra features" may be line-powered only and
operate during a power failure; VoIP can never do so without a _b_a_c_k_u_p_ _p_o_w_e_r
_s_o_u_r_c_e for the phone equipment and the Internet access devices. VoIP has also
become increasingly popular for gaming applications, as a form of communication
between players. Popular VoIP clients for gaming include _V_e_n_t_r_i_l_o and
_T_e_a_m_s_p_e_a_k. Modern video game consoles also offer VoIP chat features.

_F_i_l_e_ _s_h_a_r_i_n_g is an example of transferring large amounts of data across the
Internet. A _c_o_m_p_u_t_e_r_ _f_i_l_e can be emailed to customers, colleagues and friends
as an attachment. It can be uploaded to a website or _F_T_P server for easy
download by others. It can be put into a "shared location" or onto a _f_i_l_e
_s_e_r_v_e_r for instant use by colleagues. The load of bulk downloads to many users
can be eased by the use of "_m_i_r_r_o_r" servers or _p_e_e_r_-_t_o_-_p_e_e_r networks. In any of
these cases, access to the file may be controlled by user _a_u_t_h_e_n_t_i_c_a_t_i_o_n, the
transit of the file over the Internet may be obscured by _e_n_c_r_y_p_t_i_o_n, and money
may change hands for access to the file. The price can be paid by the remote
charging of funds from, for example, a credit card whose details are also
passed – usually fully encrypted – across the Internet. The origin and
authenticity of the file received may be checked by _d_i_g_i_t_a_l_ _s_i_g_n_a_t_u_r_e_s or by
_M_D_5 or other message digests. These simple features of the Internet, over a
worldwide basis, are changing the production, sale, and distribution of
anything that can be reduced to a computer file for transmission. This includes
all manner of print publications, software products, news, music, film, video,
photography, graphics and the other arts. This in turn has caused seismic
shifts in each of the existing industries that previously controlled the
production and distribution of these products.
_S_t_r_e_a_m_i_n_g_ _m_e_d_i_a is the real-time delivery of digital media for the immediate
consumption or enjoyment by end users. Many radio and television broadcasters
provide Internet feeds of their live audio and video productions. They may also
allow time-shift viewing or listening such as Preview, Classic Clips and Listen
Again features. These providers have been joined by a range of pure Internet
"broadcasters" who never had on-air licenses. This means that an Internet-
connected device, such as a computer or something more specific, can be used to
access on-line media in much the same way as was previously possible only with
a television or radio receiver. The range of available types of content is much
wider, from specialized technical _w_e_b_c_a_s_t_s to on-demand popular multimedia
services. _P_o_d_c_a_s_t_i_n_g is a variation on this theme, where – usually audio –
material is downloaded and played back on a computer or shifted to a _p_o_r_t_a_b_l_e
_m_e_d_i_a_ _p_l_a_y_e_r to be listened to on the move. These techniques using simple
equipment allow anybody, with little censorship or licensing control, to
broadcast audio-visual material worldwide.
Digital media streaming increases the demand for network bandwidth. For
example, standard image quality needs 1 Mbit/s link speed for SD 480p, HD 720p
quality requires 2.5 Mbit/s, and the top-of-the-line HDX quality needs 4.5
Mbit/s for 1080p._[_4_2_]
_W_e_b_c_a_m_s are a low-cost extension of this phenomenon. While some webcams can
give full-frame-rate video, the picture either is usually small or updates
slowly. Internet users can watch animals around an African waterhole, ships in
the _P_a_n_a_m_a_ _C_a_n_a_l, traffic at a local roundabout or monitor their own premises,
live and in real time. Video _c_h_a_t_ _r_o_o_m_s and _v_i_d_e_o_ _c_o_n_f_e_r_e_n_c_i_n_g are also popular
with many uses being found for personal webcams, with and without two-way
sound. YouTube was founded on 15 February 2005 and is now the leading website
for free streaming video with a vast number of users. It uses a _f_l_a_s_h-based web
player to stream and show video files. Registered users may upload an unlimited
amount of video and build their own personal profile. YouTube claims that its
users watch hundreds of millions, and upload hundreds of thousands of videos
daily._[_4_3_]

coffee shops, in some cases just for brief use while standing. Various terms
are used, such as "public Internet kiosk", "public access terminal", and "Web
_p_a_y_p_h_o_n_e". Many hotels now also have public terminals, though these are usually
fee-based. These terminals are widely accessed for various usage like ticket
booking, bank deposit, online payment etc. Wi-Fi provides wireless access to
computer networks, and therefore can do so to the Internet itself. _H_o_t_s_p_o_t_s
providing such access include _W_i_-_F_i_ _c_a_f_e_s, where would-be users need to bring
their own wireless-enabled devices such as a laptop or _P_D_A. These services may
be free to all, free to customers only, or fee-based. A hotspot need not be
limited to a confined location. A whole campus or park, or even an entire city
can be enabled.
_G_r_a_s_s_r_o_o_t_s efforts have led to _w_i_r_e_l_e_s_s_ _c_o_m_m_u_n_i_t_y_ _n_e_t_w_o_r_k_s. Commercial Wi-Fi

accessed from such places as a park bench._[_4_4_] Apart from Wi-Fi, there have
been experiments with proprietary mobile wireless networks like _R_i_c_o_c_h_e_t,
various high-speed data services over cellular phone networks, and fixed
wireless services. High-end mobile phones such as _s_m_a_r_t_p_h_o_n_e_s in general come
with Internet access through the phone network. Web browsers such as _O_p_e_r_a are
available on these advanced handsets, which can also run a wide variety of
other Internet software. More mobile phones have Internet access than PCs,
though this is not as widely used._[_4_5_] An Internet access provider and protocol
matrix differentiates the methods used to get online.
An Internet blackout or outage can be caused by local signaling interruptions.
Disruptions of _s_u_b_m_a_r_i_n_e_ _c_o_m_m_u_n_i_c_a_t_i_o_n_s_ _c_a_b_l_e_s may cause blackouts or slowdowns

countries are more vulnerable due to a small number of high-capacity links.
Land cables are also vulnerable, as in 2011 when a woman digging for scrap
metal severed most connectivity for the nation of Armenia._[_4_6_] Internet

Overall Internet usage has seen tremendous growth. From 2000 to 2009, the
number of Internet users globally rose from 394 million to 1.858 billion._[_5_3_]
By 2010, 22 percent of the world's population had access to computers with 1
billion _G_o_o_g_l_e searches every day, 300 million Internet users reading blogs,
and 2 billion videos viewed daily on YouTube._[_5_4_]
The prevalent language for communication on the Internet has been English. This
may be a result of the origin of the Internet, as well as the language's role
as a _l_i_n_g_u_a_ _f_r_a_n_c_a. Early computer systems were limited to the characters in
the _A_m_e_r_i_c_a_n_ _S_t_a_n_d_a_r_d_ _C_o_d_e_ _f_o_r_ _I_n_f_o_r_m_a_t_i_o_n_ _I_n_t_e_r_c_h_a_n_g_e (ASCII), a subset of the
_L_a_t_i_n_ _a_l_p_h_a_b_e_t.
After English (27%), the most requested languages on the _W_o_r_l_d_ _W_i_d_e_ _W_e_b are
Chinese (23%), Spanish (8%), Japanese (5%), Portuguese and German (4% each),
Arabic, French and Russian (3% each), and Korean (2%)._[_5_5_] By region, 42% of
the world's _I_n_t_e_r_n_e_t_ _u_s_e_r_s are based in Asia, 24% in Europe, 14% in North
America, 10% in Latin America and the _C_a_r_i_b_b_e_a_n taken together, 6% in Africa,
3% in the Middle East and 1% in Australia/Oceania._[_5_6_] The Internet's
technologies have developed enough in recent years, especially in the use of
_U_n_i_c_o_d_e, that good facilities are available for development and communication
in the world's widely used languages. However, some glitches such as _m_o_j_i_b_a_k_e
(incorrect display of some languages' characters) still remain.
In an American study in 2005, the percentage of men using the Internet was very
slightly ahead of the percentage of women, although this difference reversed in
those under 30. Men logged on more often, spent more time online, and were more
likely to be broadband users, whereas women tended to make more use of
opportunities to communicate (such as email). Men were more likely to use the
Internet to pay bills, participate in auctions, and for recreation such as
downloading music and videos. Men and women were equally likely to use the
Internet for shopping and banking._[_5_7_] More recent studies indicate that in
2008, women significantly outnumbered men on most social networking sites, such
as Facebook and Myspace, although the ratios varied with age._[_5_8_] In addition,
women watched more streaming content, whereas men downloaded more._[_5_9_] In terms
of blogs, men were more likely to blog in the first place; among those who
blog, men were more likely to have a professional blog, whereas women were more
likely to have a personal blog._[_6_0_]
According to Euromonitor, by 2020 43.7% of the world's population will be users
of the Internet. Splitting by country, in 2011 Iceland, Norway and the
Netherlands had the highest Internet penetration by the number of users, with
more than 90% of the population with access.

The Internet has enabled entirely new forms of social interaction, activities,

Many people use the World Wide Web to access news, weather and sports reports,
to plan and book vacations and to find out more about their interests. People
use _c_h_a_t, messaging and email to make and stay in touch with friends worldwide,
sometimes in the same way as some previously had _p_e_n_ _p_a_l_s. The Internet has
seen a growing number of _W_e_b_ _d_e_s_k_t_o_p_s, where users can access their files and

_S_o_c_i_a_l_ _n_e_t_w_o_r_k_i_n_g websites such as _F_a_c_e_b_o_o_k, _T_w_i_t_t_e_r, and _M_y_S_p_a_c_e have created
new ways to socialize and interact. Users of these sites are able to add a wide
variety of information to pages, to pursue common interests, and to connect
with others. It is also possible to find existing acquaintances, to allow
communication among existing groups of people. Sites like _L_i_n_k_e_d_I_n foster
commercial and business connections. YouTube and _F_l_i_c_k_r specialize in users'
videos and photographs.
The Internet has been a major outlet for leisure activity since its inception,
with entertaining _s_o_c_i_a_l_ _e_x_p_e_r_i_m_e_n_t_s such as _M_U_D_s and _M_O_O_s being conducted on
university servers, and humor-related _U_s_e_n_e_t groups receiving much traffic.
Today, many _I_n_t_e_r_n_e_t_ _f_o_r_u_m_s have sections devoted to games and funny videos;
short cartoons in the form of _F_l_a_s_h_ _m_o_v_i_e_s are also popular. Over 6 million
people use blogs or message boards as a means of communication and for the
sharing of ideas. The _I_n_t_e_r_n_e_t_ _p_o_r_n_o_g_r_a_p_h_y and _o_n_l_i_n_e_ _g_a_m_b_l_i_n_g industries have
taken advantage of the World Wide Web, and often provide a significant source
of advertising revenue for other websites._[_6_1_] Although many governments have
attempted to restrict both industries' use of the Internet, in general this has
failed to stop their widespread popularity._[_6_2_]
Another area of leisure activity on the Internet is _m_u_l_t_i_p_l_a_y_e_r_ _g_a_m_i_n_g._[_6_3_]
This form of recreation creates communities, where people of all ages and
origins enjoy the fast-paced world of multiplayer games. These range from
_M_M_O_R_P_G to _f_i_r_s_t_-_p_e_r_s_o_n_ _s_h_o_o_t_e_r_s, from _r_o_l_e_-_p_l_a_y_i_n_g_ _v_i_d_e_o_ _g_a_m_e_s to _o_n_l_i_n_e
_g_a_m_b_l_i_n_g. While online gaming has been around since the 1970s, modern modes of
online gaming began with subscription services such as _G_a_m_e_S_p_y and _M_P_l_a_y_e_r._[_6_4_]
Non-subscribers were limited to certain types of game play or certain games.
Many people use the Internet to access and download music, movies and other
works for their enjoyment and relaxation. Free and fee-based services exist for
all of these activities, using centralized servers and distributed peer-to-peer
technologies. Some of these sources exercise more care with respect to the
original artists' copyrights than others.
Internet usage has been correlated to users' loneliness._[_6_5_] Lonely people tend
to use the Internet as an outlet for their feelings and to share their stories
with others, such as in the "_I_ _a_m_ _l_o_n_e_l_y_ _w_i_l_l_ _a_n_y_o_n_e_ _s_p_e_a_k_ _t_o_ _m_e" thread.
_C_y_b_e_r_s_e_c_t_a_r_i_a_n_i_s_m is a new organizational form which involves: "highly
dispersed small groups of practitioners that may remain largely anonymous
within the larger social context and operate in relative secrecy, while still
linked remotely to a larger network of believers who share a set of practices
and texts, and often a common devotion to a particular leader. Overseas
supporters provide funding and support; domestic practitioners distribute
tracts, participate in acts of resistance, and share information on the
internal situation with outsiders. Collectively, members and practitioners of
such sects construct viable virtual communities of faith, exchanging personal
testimonies and engaging in collective study via email, on-line chat rooms and

Internet provides a particularly good venue for crowdsourcing (_o_u_t_s_o_u_r_c_i_n_g
tasks to a distributed group of people) since individuals tend to be more open
in web-based projects where they are not being physically judged or scrutinized
and thus can feel more comfortable sharing.
Crowdsourcing systems are used to accomplish a variety of tasks. For example,
the crowd may be invited to develop a new technology, carry out a design task,
refine or carry out the steps of an algorithm (see _h_u_m_a_n_-_b_a_s_e_d_ _c_o_m_p_u_t_a_t_i_o_n), or

_W_i_k_i_s have also been used in the academic community for sharing and

The Internet has achieved new relevance as a political tool. The presidential
campaign of _H_o_w_a_r_d_ _D_e_a_n in 2004 in the United States was notable for its
success in soliciting donation via the Internet. Many political groups use the

The potential of the Internet as a civic tool of communicative power was
thoroughly explored by _S_i_m_o_n_ _R_._ _B_._ _B_e_r_d_a_l in his thesis of 2004:
     As the globally evolving Internet provides ever new access points to
     virtual discourse forums, it also promotes new civic relations and
     associations within which communicative power may flow and
     accumulate. Thus, traditionally ... national-embedded peripheries get
     entangled into greater, international peripheries, with stronger
     combined powers... The Internet, as a consequence, changes the
     topology of the "centre-periphery" model, by stimulating conventional
     peripheries to interlink into "super-periphery" structures, which
     enclose and "besiege" several centres at once._[_8_2_]
Berdal, therefore, extends the _H_a_b_e_r_m_a_s_i_a_n notion of the _P_u_b_l_i_c_ _s_p_h_e_r_e to the
Internet, and underlines the inherent global and civic nature that intervowen
Internet technologies provide. To limit the growing civic potential of the
Internet, Berdal also notes how "self-protective measures" are put in place by
those threatened by it:
     If we consider China’s attempts to filter "unsuitable material"
     from the Internet, most of us would agree that this resembles a self-
     protective measure by the system against the growing civic potentials
     of the Internet. Nevertheless, both types represent limitations to
     "peripheral capacities". Thus, the Chinese government tries to
     prevent communicative power to build up and unleash (as the _1_9_8_9

     to install "upstream measures"). Even though limited, the Internet is
     proving to be an empowering tool also to the Chinese periphery:
     Analysts believe that Internet petitions have influenced policy
     implementation in favour of the public’s online-articulated will

The spread of low-cost Internet access in developing countries has opened up
new possibilities for _p_e_e_r_-_t_o_-_p_e_e_r charities, which allow individuals to
contribute small amounts to charitable projects for other individuals.
Websites, such as _D_o_n_o_r_s_C_h_o_o_s_e and _G_l_o_b_a_l_G_i_v_i_n_g, allow small-scale donors to
direct funds to individual projects of their choice.
A popular twist on Internet-based philanthropy is the use of _p_e_e_r_-_t_o_-_p_e_e_r
_l_e_n_d_i_n_g for charitable purposes. _K_i_v_a pioneered this concept in 2005, offering
the first web-based service to publish individual loan profiles for funding.
Kiva raises funds for local intermediary _m_i_c_r_o_f_i_n_a_n_c_e organizations which post
stories and updates on behalf of the borrowers. Lenders can contribute as
little as $25 to loans of their choice, and receive their money back as
borrowers repay. Kiva falls short of being a pure peer-to-peer charity, in that
loans are disbursed before being funded by lenders and borrowers do not
communicate with lenders themselves._[_8_3_]_[_8_4_]
However, the recent spread of low cost Internet access in _d_e_v_e_l_o_p_i_n_g_ _c_o_u_n_t_r_i_e_s
has made genuine international person-to-person philanthropy increasingly
feasible. In 2009 the US-based nonprofit _Z_i_d_i_s_h_a tapped into this trend to
offer the first person-to-person microfinance platform to link lenders and
borrowers across international borders without intermediaries. Members can fund
loans for as little as a dollar, which the borrowers then use to develop
business activities that improve their families' incomes while repaying loans
to the members with interest. Borrowers access the Internet via public
cybercafes, donated laptops in village schools, and even smart phones, then
create their own profile pages through which they share photos and information
about themselves and their businesses. As they repay their loans, borrowers
continue to share updates and dialogue with lenders via their profile pages.
This direct web-based connection allows members themselves to take on many of
the communication and recording tasks traditionally performed by local
organizations, bypassing geographic barriers and dramatically reducing the cost
of microfinance services to the entrepreneurs._[_8_5_]

content. This is accomplished through software that filters domains and content
so that they may not be easily accessed or obtained without elaborate
circumvention._[_8_9_]
In Norway, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, major Internet service providers have
voluntarily, possibly to avoid such an arrangement being turned into law,
agreed to restrict access to sites listed by authorities. While this list of
forbidden URLs is supposed to contain addresses of only known child pornography
sites, the content of the list is secret._[_9_0_] Many countries, including the
