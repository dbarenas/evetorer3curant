Library at _M_e_l_k_ _A_b_b_e_y in Austria
A lliibbrraarryy (from French "librairie"; Latin "liber" = book) is an organized
collection of information resources made accessible to a defined community for
reference or borrowing. It provides physical or digital access to material, and
may be a physical building or room, or a virtual space, or both._[_1_] A library's
collection can include _b_o_o_k_s, _p_e_r_i_o_d_i_c_a_l_s, _n_e_w_s_p_a_p_e_r_s, _m_a_n_u_s_c_r_i_p_t_s, _f_i_l_m_s,
_m_a_p_s, _p_r_i_n_t_s, _d_o_c_u_m_e_n_t_s, _m_i_c_r_o_f_o_r_m, _C_D_s, _c_a_s_s_e_t_t_e_s, _v_i_d_e_o_t_a_p_e_s, _D_V_D_s, _B_l_u_-_r_a_y

size from a few shelves of books to several million items. In Latin and Greek,
the idea of _b_o_o_k_c_a_s_e is represented by Bibliotheca and BibliothÄ“kÄ“ (Greek:
Î²Î¹Î²Î»Î¹Î¿Î¸Î®ÎºÎ·): derivatives of these mean library in many modern
languages, e.g. French bibliothÃ¨que.
The first libraries consisted of _a_r_c_h_i_v_e_s of the _e_a_r_l_i_e_s_t_ _f_o_r_m_ _o_f_ _w_r_i_t_i_n_g - the
_c_l_a_y_ _t_a_b_l_e_t_s in _c_u_n_e_i_f_o_r_m_ _s_c_r_i_p_t discovered in _S_u_m_e_r, some dating back to 2600
BC. These written archives mark the end of _p_r_e_h_i_s_t_o_r_y and the start of _h_i_s_t_o_r_y.
The earliest discovered private archives were kept at _U_g_a_r_i_t. There is also
evidence of libraries at _N_i_p_p_u_r about 1900 BC and at _N_i_n_e_v_e_h about 700 BC
showing a _l_i_b_r_a_r_y_ _c_l_a_s_s_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n system. Private or personal libraries made up
of written books (as opposed to the state or institutional records kept in
archives) appeared in _c_l_a_s_s_i_c_a_l_ _G_r_e_e_c_e in the 5th century BC. In the 6th
century, at the very close of the _C_l_a_s_s_i_c_a_l_ _p_e_r_i_o_d, the great libraries of the
Mediterranean world remained those of _C_o_n_s_t_a_n_t_i_n_o_p_l_e and _A_l_e_x_a_n_d_r_i_a. From the
15th century in central and northern Italy, libraries of _h_u_m_a_n_i_s_t_s and their
enlightened patrons provided a nucleus around which an "_a_c_a_d_e_m_y" of scholars
congregated in each Italian city of consequence. _T_i_a_n_y_i_ _C_h_a_m_b_e_r, founded in
1561 by Fan Qin during the _M_i_n_g_ _D_y_n_a_s_t_y, is the oldest existing library in
China. In its heyday it boasted a collection of 70,000 volumes of antique
books. The first library classification system was set up during the _H_a_n
_D_y_n_a_s_t_y. In North America, it is believed that personal collections of books
were brought over to the continent by French settlers in the 16th century. The
oldest non-personal library on the North American continent was founded at The
Jesuit College in Quebec City in 1635. The first textbook on _l_i_b_r_a_r_y_ _s_c_i_e_n_c_e
was published 1808 by _M_a_r_t_i_n_ _S_c_h_r_e_t_t_i_n_g_e_r._[_2_]
A library is organized for use and maintained by a public body, an institution,
a corporation, or a private individual. Public and institutional collections
and services may be intended for use by people who choose not to â€” or cannot
afford to â€” purchase an extensive collection themselves, who need material no
individual can reasonably be expected to have, or who require professional
assistance with their research. In addition to providing materials, libraries
also provide the services of _l_i_b_r_a_r_i_a_n_s who are experts at finding and
organizing information and at interpreting information needs. Libraries often
provide quiet areas for studying, and they also often offer common areas to
facilitate group study and collaboration. Libraries often provide public
facilities for access to their electronic resources and the _I_n_t_e_r_n_e_t. Modern
libraries are increasingly being redefined as places to get unrestricted access
to _i_n_f_o_r_m_a_t_i_o_n in many formats and from many sources. They are extending
services beyond the physical walls of a building, by providing material
accessible by electronic means, and by providing the assistance of librarians
in navigating and analyzing very large amounts of information with a variety of
digital tools.

Private or personal libraries made up of written books (as opposed to the state
or institutional records kept in archives) appeared in classical Greece in the
5th century BC. The celebrated book collectors of _H_e_l_l_e_n_i_s_t_i_c _A_n_t_i_q_u_i_t_y were
listed in the late 2nd century in _D_e_i_p_n_o_s_o_p_h_i_s_t_a_e. All these libraries were
Greek; the cultivated Hellenized diners in Deipnosophistae pass over the
libraries of Rome in silence. By the time of Augustus there were public
libraries near the forums of Rome: there were libraries in the _P_o_r_t_i_c_u_s
_O_c_t_a_v_i_a_e near the _T_h_e_a_t_r_e_ _o_f_ _M_a_r_c_e_l_l_u_s, in the temple of Apollo Palatinus, and
in the Bibliotheca Ulpiana in the _F_o_r_u_m_ _o_f_ _T_r_a_j_a_n. The state archives were kept
in a structure on the slope between the _R_o_m_a_n_ _F_o_r_u_m and the _C_a_p_i_t_o_l_i_n_e_ _H_i_l_l.
Private libraries appeared during the late republic: _S_e_n_e_c_a inveighed against
libraries fitted out for show by illiterate owners who scarcely read their
titles in the course of a lifetime, but displayed the scrolls in bookcases
(armaria) of citrus wood inlaid with ivory that ran right to the ceiling: "by
now, like bathrooms and hot water, a library is got up as standard equipment
for a fine house (_d_o_m_u_s)._[_1_8_] Libraries were amenities suited to a villa, such
as Cicero's at Tusculum, _M_a_e_c_e_n_a_s's several villas, or Pliny the Younger's, all
described in surviving letters. At the _V_i_l_l_a_ _o_f_ _t_h_e_ _P_a_p_y_r_i at _H_e_r_c_u_l_a_n_e_u_m,
apparently the villa of Caesar's father-in-law, the Greek library has been
partly preserved in volcanic ash; archaeologists speculate that a Latin
library, kept separate from the Greek one, may await discovery at the site.
In the West, the first public libraries were established under the _R_o_m_a_n_ _E_m_p_i_r_e
as each succeeding emperor strove to open one or many which outshone that of
his predecessor. Romeâ€™s first public library was established by _A_s_i_n_i_u_s
_P_o_l_l_i_o. Pollio was a lieutenant of _J_u_l_i_u_s_ _C_a_e_s_a_r and one of his most ardent
supporters. After his military victory in Illyria, Pollio felt he had enough
fame and fortune to create what Julius Caesar had sought for a long time: a
public library to increase the prestige of Rome and rival the one in
Alexandria._[_1_9_] Polliosâ€™s library, the Anla Libertatis,_[_2_0_] which was housed
in the Atrium Libertatis, was centrally located near the _F_o_r_u_m_ _R_o_m_a_n_u_m. It was
the first to employ an architectural design that separated works into Greek and
Latin. All subsequent Roman public libraries will have this design._[_2_1_] At the
conclusion of Romeâ€™s civil wars following the death of _M_a_r_c_u_s_ _A_n_t_o_n_i_u_s in 30
B.C., the Emperor Augustus sought to reconstruct many of Romeâ€™s damaged
buildings. During this construction, Augustus created two more public
libraries. The first was the library of the Temple of Apollo on the Palatine,
often called the _P_a_l_a_t_i_n_e_ _l_i_b_r_a_r_y, and the second was the library of the
Porticus of Octaviae_[_2_2_]
Two more libraries were added by the _E_m_p_e_r_o_r_ _T_i_b_e_r_i_u_s on Palatine Hill and one
by Vespasian after 70 A.D. Vespasianâ€™s library was constructed in the _F_o_r_u_m
_o_f_ _V_e_s_p_a_s_i_a_n, also known as the Forum of Peace, and became one of Romeâ€™s
principal libraries. The Bibliotheca Pacis was built along the traditional
model and had two large halls with rooms for Greek and Latin libraries
containing the works of Galen and Lucius Aelius._[_2_3_] One of the best preserved
was the ancient Ulpian Library built by the Emperor Trajan. Completed in 112/
113 A.D., the Ulpian Library was part of Trajanâ€™s Forum built on the
Capitoline Hill. Trajanâ€™s Column separated the Greek and Latin rooms which
faced each other._[_2_4_] The structure was approximately fifty feet high with the
peak of the roof reaching almost seventy feet._[_2_5_]
Unlike the Greek libraries, readers had direct access to the scrolls, which
were kept on shelves built into the walls of a large room. Reading or copying
was normally done in the room itself. The surviving records give only a few
instances of lending features. Most of the large _R_o_m_a_n_ _b_a_t_h_s were also cultural
centres, built from the start with a library, a two room arrangement with one
room for Greek and one for Latin texts.
Libraries were filled with _p_a_r_c_h_m_e_n_t_ _s_c_r_o_l_l_s as at _L_i_b_r_a_r_y_ _o_f_ _P_e_r_g_a_m_u_m and on
_p_a_p_y_r_u_s scrolls as at _A_l_e_x_a_n_d_r_i_a: the export of prepared writing materials was
a staple of commerce. There were a few institutional or royal libraries which
were open to an educated public (such as the Serapeum collection of the _L_i_b_r_a_r_y
_o_f_ _A_l_e_x_a_n_d_r_i_a, once the largest _l_i_b_r_a_r_y_ _i_n_ _t_h_e_ _a_n_c_i_e_n_t_ _w_o_r_l_d),_[_1_5_] but on the
whole collections were private. In those rare cases where it was possible for a
scholar to consult library books there seems to have been no direct access to
the stacks. In all recorded cases the books were kept in a relatively small
room where the staff went to get them for the readers, who had to consult them
in an adjoining hall or covered walkway.

system during the _H_a_n_ _D_y_n_a_s_t_y,_[_2_6_] and the first book notation system. At this
time the library catalogue was written on scrolls of fine _s_i_l_k and stored in
silk bags.

During the Late Antiquity and Middle Ages periods, there was no Rome of the
kind that ruled the Mediterranean for centuries and spawned the culture that
produced twenty-eight public libraries in the urbs Roma._[_2_8_] The empire had
been divided then later re-united again under Constantine the Great who moved
the capital of the Roman Empire in 330 A.D. to the city of Byzantium which was
renamed Constantinople._[_2_9_] The Roman intellectual culture that flourished in
ancient times was undergoing a transformation as the academic world moved from
laymen to Christian clergy._[_3_0_] As the West crumbled, books and libraries
flourished and flowed east toward the Byzantine Empire._[_3_1_] There, four
different types of libraries were established: imperial, patriarchal, monastic,
and private._[_3_2_] Each had it own purpose and, as a result, their survival
varied.
Christianity was a new force in Europe and many of the faithful saw Hellenistic
culture as pagan. As such, many classical Greek works, written on scrolls, were
left to decay as only Christian texts were thought fit for preservation in a
codex, the progenitor of the modern book._[_3_3_] In the East, however, this was
not the case as many of these classical Greek and Roman texts were copied._[_3_4_]
In Byzantium, much of this work devoted to preserving Hellenistic thought in
codex form was performed in _s_c_r_i_p_t_o_r_i_u_m_s by monks._[_3_5_] While mmoonnaassttiicc lliibbrraarryy
scriptoriums flourished throughout the East and West, the rules governing them
were generally the same _[_3_6_] Barren and sun-lit rooms (because candles were a
source of fire) were major features of the scriptorium that was both a model of
production and monastic piety._[_3_7_] Monks scribbled away for hours a day,
interrupted only by meals and prayers._[_3_8_] With such production, medieval
monasteries began to accumulate large libraries. These libraries were devoted
solely to the education of the monks and were seen as essential to their
spiritual development._[_3_9_] Although most of these texts that were produced were
Christian in nature, many monastic leaders saw common virtues in the Greek
classics. As a result, many of these Greek works were copied, and thus saved,
in monastic scriptoriums._[_4_0_]
When Europe passed into the Dark Ages, Byzantine scriptoriums laboriously
preserved Greco-Roman classics. As a result, Byzantium revived Classical models
of education and libraries._[_4_1_] The Imperial Library of _C_o_n_s_t_a_n_t_i_n_o_p_l_e was an
important depository of ancient knowledge. Constantine himself wanted such a
library but his short rule denied him the ability to see his vision to
fruition. His son Constantius II made this dream a reality and created an
iimmppeerriiaall lliibbrraarryy in a portico of the royal palace._[_4_2_] He ruled for 24 years
and accelerated the development of the library and the intellectual culture
that came with such a vast accumulation of books._[_4_3_]
Constantius II appointed _T_h_e_m_i_s_t_i_u_s, a pagan philosopher and teacher, as chief
architect of this library building program. Themistius set about a bold program
to create an imperial public library that would be the centerpiece of the new
intellectual capital of Constantinople._[_4_4_] Classical authors such as Plato,
Aristotle, Demosthenes, Isocrates, Thucydides, Homer, and Zeno were sought.
Themeistius hired calligraphers and craftsman to produce the actual codices. He
also appointed educators and created a university-like school centered around
the library._[_4_5_]
After the death of Constantius II, Julian the Apostate, a bibliophile
intellectual, ruled briefly for less than three years. Despite this, he had a
profound impact on the imperial library and sought both Christian and pagan
books for its collections._[_4_2_] Later, the Emperor Valens hired Greek and Latin
scribes full-time with from the royal treasury to copy and repair manuscripts.
_[_4_6_]
At its height in the fifth century, the Imperial Library of _C_o_n_s_t_a_n_t_i_n_o_p_l_e had
120,000 volumes and was the largest library in Europe._[_4_7_] A fire in 477
consumed the entire library but it was rebuilt only to be burned again in 726,
1204, and in 1453 when Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Turks._[_4_8_]
PPaattrriiaarrcchhaall lliibbrraarriieess fared no better, and sometimes worse, than the Imperial
Library. The Library of the Patriarchate of Constantinople was founded most
likely during the reign of Constantine the Great in the fourth century._[_4_9_] As
a theological library, it was known to have employed a library classification
system._[_5_0_] It also served as a repository of several ecumenical councils such
as the Council of Nicea, Council of Ephesus, and the Council of Chalcedon. The
library, which employed a librarian and assistants, may have been originally
located in the Patriarchâ€™s official residence before it was moved to the
Thomaites Triclinus in the seventh century. While much is not known about the
actual library itself, it is known that many of its contents were subject to
destruction as religious in-fighting ultimately resulted in book burnings._[_5_1_]
During this period, small pprriivvaattee lliibbrraarriieess existed. Many of these were owned
by church members and the aristocracy._[_5_2_] Teachers also were known to have
small personal libraries as well as wealthy bibliophiles who could afford the
highly ornate books of the period._[_5_3_]
Thus,in the 6th century, at the very close of the _C_l_a_s_s_i_c_a_l_ _p_e_r_i_o_d, the great
libraries of the Mediterranean world remained those of _C_o_n_s_t_a_n_t_i_n_o_p_l_e and
Alexandria.
_C_a_s_s_i_o_d_o_r_u_s, minister to Theodoric, established a monastery at Vivarium in the
heel of Italy with a library where he attempted to bring Greek learning to
Latin readers and preserve texts both sacred and secular for future
generations. As its unofficial librarian, Cassiodorus not only collected as
many manuscripts as he could, he also wrote treatises aimed at instructing his
monks in the proper uses of reading and methods for copying texts accurately.
In the end, however, the library at Vivarium was dispersed and lost within a
century.
Through _O_r_i_g_e_n and especially the scholarly presbyter _P_a_m_p_h_i_l_u_s_ _o_f_ _C_a_e_s_a_r_e_a, an
avid collector of books of Scripture, the theological school of Caesarea won a
reputation for having the _m_o_s_t_ _e_x_t_e_n_s_i_v_e_ _e_c_c_l_e_s_i_a_s_t_i_c_a_l_ _l_i_b_r_a_r_y_ _o_f_ _t_h_e_ _t_i_m_e,
containing more than 30,000 manuscripts: _G_r_e_g_o_r_y_ _N_a_z_i_a_n_z_u_s, _B_a_s_i_l_ _t_h_e_ _G_r_e_a_t,
_J_e_r_o_m_e and others came and studied there.
Inside a Qur'anic Library in Chinguetti, Mauritania
By the 8th century first _I_r_a_n_i_a_n_s and then _A_r_a_b_s had imported the craft of
_p_a_p_e_r_m_a_k_i_n_g from China, with a _p_a_p_e_r_ _m_i_l_l already at work in _B_a_g_h_d_a_d in 794. By
the 9th century _p_u_b_l_i_c_ _l_i_b_r_a_r_i_e_s started to appear in many Islamic cities. They
were called "halls of Science" or dar al-'ilm. They were each endowed by
_I_s_l_a_m_i_c sects with the purpose of representing their tenets as well as
promoting the dissemination of secular knowledge. The 9th century _A_b_b_a_s_i_d
_C_a_l_i_p_h _a_l_-_M_u_t_a_w_a_k_k_i_l of _I_r_a_q, ordered the construction of a "zawiyat qurra" â€“
an enclosure for readers which was "lavishly furnished and equipped".
In _S_h_i_r_a_z Adhud al-Daula (d. 983) set up a library, described by the medieval
historian, _a_l_-_M_u_q_a_d_d_a_s_i, as "a complex of buildings surrounded by gardens with
lakes and waterways. The buildings were topped with domes, and comprised an
upper and a lower story with a total, according to the chief official, of 360
rooms.... In each _d_e_p_a_r_t_m_e_n_t, _c_a_t_a_l_o_g_u_e_s were placed on a shelf... the rooms
were furnished with carpets"._[_5_4_]
The libraries often employed translators and copyists in large numbers, in
order to render into _A_r_a_b_i_c the bulk of the available _P_e_r_s_i_a_n, _G_r_e_e_k, Roman and
_S_a_n_s_k_r_i_t non-fiction and the classics of literature.
This flowering of Islamic learning ceased centuries later when learning began
declining in the _I_s_l_a_m_i_c_ _w_o_r_l_d, after many of these libraries were destroyed by
_M_o_n_g_o_l_ _i_n_v_a_s_i_o_n_s. Others were victim of wars and religious strife in the
Islamic world. However, a few examples of these medieval libraries, such as the
libraries of _C_h_i_n_g_u_e_t_t_i in _W_e_s_t_ _A_f_r_i_c_a, remain intact and relatively unchanged.
Another ancient library from this period which is still operational and
expanding is the _C_e_n_t_r_a_l_ _L_i_b_r_a_r_y_ _o_f_ _A_s_t_a_n_ _Q_u_d_s_ _R_a_z_a_v_i in the Iranian city of
_M_a_s_h_h_a_d, which has been operating for more than six centuries.
The contents of these Islamic libraries were copied by Christian monks in
Muslim/Christian border areas, particularly Spain and Sicily. From there they
eventually made their way into other parts of Christian _E_u_r_o_p_e. These copies
joined works that had been preserved directly by Christian monks from Greek and
Roman originals, as well as copies Western Christian monks made of _B_y_z_a_n_t_i_n_e
works. The resulting conglomerate libraries are the basis of every modern
library today.
Buddhist scriptures, educational materials, and histories were stored in
libraries in pre-modern _S_o_u_t_h_e_a_s_t_ _A_s_i_a. In _B_u_r_m_a, a royal library called the
_P_i_t_a_k_a_ _T_a_i_k was legendarily founded by King _A_n_a_w_r_a_h_t_a;_[_5_5_] in the 18th century,
British envoy Michael Symes, upon visiting this library, wrote that "it is not
improbable that his Birman majesty may possess a more numerous library than any
potentate, from the banks of the Danube to the borders of China". In Thailand
libraries called _h_o_ _t_r_a_i were built throughout the country, usually on stilts
above a pond to prevent bugs from eating at the books.
In the _E_a_r_l_y_ _M_i_d_d_l_e_ _A_g_e_s, monastery libraries developed, such as the important
one at the _A_b_b_e_y_ _o_f_ _M_o_n_t_e_c_a_s_s_i_n_o in Italy._[_5_6_] Books were usually _c_h_a_i_n_e_d_ _t_o
_t_h_e_ _s_h_e_l_v_e_s, reflecting the fact that _m_a_n_u_s_c_r_i_p_t_s, which were created via the
labour-intensive process of hand copying, were valuable possessions._[_5_7_]
Despite this protectiveness, many libraries loaned books if provided with
security deposits (usually money or a book of equal value). Lending was a means
by which books could be copied and spread. In 1212 the council of Paris
condemned those monasteries that still forbade loaning books, reminding them
that lending is "one of the chief works of mercy."_[_5_8_] The early libraries
located in monastic _c_l_o_i_s_t_e_r_s and associated with _s_c_r_i_p_t_o_r_i_a were collections
of lecterns with books chained to them. Shelves built above and between back-
to-back lecterns were the beginning of _b_o_o_k_p_r_e_s_s_e_s. The chain was attached at
the fore-edge of a book rather than to its spine. Book presses came to be
arranged in _c_a_r_r_e_l_s (perpendicular to the walls and therefore to the windows)
in order to maximize lighting, with low bookcases in front of the windows. This
"stall system" (i.e. fixed bookcases perpendicular to exterior walls pierced by
closely spaced windows) was characteristic of English institutional libraries.
In European libraries, bookcases were arranged parallel to and against the
walls. This "wall system" was first introduced on a large scale in Spain's _E_l
_E_s_c_o_r_i_a_l.
Also, in Eastern Christianity monastery libraries kept important manuscripts.
The most important of them were the ones in the monasteries of _M_o_u_n_t_ _A_t_h_o_s for
Orthodox Christians, and the library of the _S_a_i_n_t_ _C_a_t_h_e_r_i_n_e_'_s_ _M_o_n_a_s_t_e_r_y_,_ _M_o_u_n_t

From the 15th century in central and northern Italy, libraries of _h_u_m_a_n_i_s_t_s and
their enlightened patrons provided a nucleus around which an "_a_c_a_d_e_m_y" of

The 16th and 17th centuries saw other privately endowed libraries assembled in

_[_6_1_] during this some of the more important libraries were founded in Europe,

The 18th century is considered to be an advancement to all cultural
developments in _l_i_b_r_a_r_y_ _h_i_s_t_o_r_y, and it is at this time that we see the
beginning of the functional library. In France, the French Revolution saw the
confiscation in 1789 of church libraries and rich nobles' private libraries,
and their collections became state property. The confiscated stock became part
of a new national library â€“ the _B_i_b_l_i_o_t_h_Ã_¨_q_u_e_ _N_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_e. Two famous

identified over 300,000 books and manuscripts that became the property of the
people in the BibliothÃ¨que Nationale._[_6_3_] During the French Revolution,
librarians were solely responsible for the bibliographic planning of the
nation. Out of this came the implementation of the concept of library service
â€“ the democratic extension of library services to the general public
regardless of wealth or education._[_6_3_]

Many institutions make a distinction between a circulating or _l_e_n_d_i_n_g_ _l_i_b_r_a_r_y,
where materials are expected and intended to be loaned to patrons,
institutions, or other libraries, and a reference library where material is not
lent out. Modern libraries are often a mixture of both, containing a general
collection for circulation, and a reference collection which is restricted to
the library premises. Also, increasingly, digital collections enable broader
access to material that may not circulate in print, and enables libraries to
expand their collections even without building a larger facility.

A research library is collection of materials on one or more subjects._[_6_6_] A
research library supports scholarly or scientific research and will generally

collections and attempt to provide access to all necessary materials. A

_s_p_e_c_i_a_l_ _l_i_b_r_a_r_y may have a research library within its special field and a very
few of the largest public libraries also serve as research libraries. A large
university library may be considered a research library; and in North America
such libraries may belong to the _A_s_s_o_c_i_a_t_i_o_n_ _o_f_ _R_e_s_e_a_r_c_h_ _L_i_b_r_a_r_i_e_s._[_6_7_] In the
United Kingdom they may be members of Research Libraries UK (RLUK)._[_6_8_]
A research library can be either a reference library, which does not lend its
holdings, or a lending library, which does lend all or some of its holdings.
Some extremely large or traditional research libraries are entirely reference
in this sense, lending none of their materials; most academic research
libraries, at least in the U.S. and the U.K., now lend books, but not
periodicals or other materials. Many research libraries are attached to a
parental organization and serve only members of that organization.

_p_o_l_i_c_e._[_7_1_] After understanding the firm determination of the protestors, at
the 6th day of the protests, the police force started to withdraw from Taksim
Square, allowing protestors to re-occupy the square. Protesters "shun
violence". Demonstrators returning to the square organized to clean the square,
which has become littered with debris. All of protestors and newcomers
participated in the cleanup of the square. After the cleanup process,
protesters built a patched up library (called Gezi Park Library) with the
stones and woods they found in the construction yard on the square and asked
all publishing houses to send books and support the movement with some good
literature. More than 15 publishing houses have responded to the call. _[_7_2_] The
campaign got accelerated with the support of Twitter campaign._[_7_3_] Everyday,
during the protests, people coming to the park for support brought books(mostly
about politics, sociology, history and literature) to donate Gezi Park library.
_[_7_4_] Protestors read those books while they were guarding the trees in the
Taksim square with night shifts during the _2_0_1_3_ _p_r_o_t_e_s_t_s_ _i_n_ _T_u_r_k_e_y. After the

from different parts of the country and delivered to Gezi Park Library.

A reference library does not lend books and other items; instead, they must be
read at the library itself. Typically such libraries are used for research
purposes, for example at a university. Some items at reference libraries may be
historical and even unique. Examples of reference libraries include the _B_r_i_t_i_s_h
_L_i_b_r_a_r_y in London and the _B_o_d_l_e_i_a_n_ _L_i_b_r_a_r_y at _O_x_f_o_r_d_ _U_n_i_v_e_r_s_i_t_y. Many lending
libraries contain a "reference section", which holds books, such as
dictionaries, which are common reference books, and are therefore not lent out.
_[_7_6_] Such reference sections may be referred to as "reading rooms", which may
also include newspapers and periodicals._[_7_7_]

The public library of _P_o_l_i_c_e_,_ _P_o_l_a_n_d
A community library in Ethiopia

A public library provides services to the general public and usually makes at
least some of its books available for borrowing. Typically, libraries issue
_l_i_b_r_a_r_y_ _c_a_r_d_s to community members wishing to borrow books. Many public
libraries also serve as community organizations that provide free services and
events to the public, such as reading groups and toddler story time.
The earliest example in England of a library to be endowed for the benefit of
users who were not members of an institution such as a cathedral or college was
the _F_r_a_n_c_i_s_ _T_r_i_g_g_e_ _C_h_a_i_n_e_d_ _L_i_b_r_a_r_y in _G_r_a_n_t_h_a_m, _L_i_n_c_o_l_n_s_h_i_r_e, established in
1598. The library still exists and can justifiably claim to be the forerunner
of later public library systems. The beginning of the modern, free, open access
libraries really got its start in the U.K. in 1847. _P_a_r_l_i_a_m_e_n_t appointed a
committee, led by William Ewart, on Public Libraries to consider the necessity
of establishing libraries through the nation: In 1849 their report noted the
poor condition of library service, it recommended the establishment of free
public libraries all over the country, and it led to the Public Libraries Act
in 1850, which allowed all cities with populations exceeding 10,000 to levy
taxes for the support of public libraries. Another important act was the 1870
Public School Law, which increased literacy, thereby the demand for libraries,
so by 1877, more than 75 cities had established free libraries, and by 1900 the
number had reached 300._[_7_8_] This finally marks the start of the public library
as we know it. And these acts influenced similar laws in other countries, most
notably the U.S. The first tax-supported public library in the United States
was Peterborough, New Hampshire (1833) first supported by state funds then an
"Act Providing for the Establishment of Public Libraries" in 1849._[_7_9_]
The year 1876 is key in the history of librarianship in the United States. The
_A_m_e_r_i_c_a_n_ _L_i_b_r_a_r_y_ _A_s_s_o_c_i_a_t_i_o_n was formed, as well as The American Library
Journal, _M_e_l_v_i_l_ _D_e_w_e_y published his _d_e_c_i_m_a_l_-_b_a_s_e_d_ _s_y_s_t_e_m of classification, and
the United States Bureau of Education published its report, "Public libraries
in the United States of America; their history, condition, and management."
During the post-Civil War years, there was a rise in the establishment of
public libraries, a movement led chiefly by newly formed _w_o_m_e_n_'_s_ _c_l_u_b_s. They
contributed their own collections of books, conducted lengthy fund raising
campaigns for buildings, and lobbied within their communities for financial
support for libraries, as well as with legislatures and the _C_a_r_n_e_g_i_e_ _L_i_b_r_a_r_y
Endowment founded in the 20th century._[_8_0_] They led the establishment of
75â€“80 percent of the libraries in communities across the country._[_8_1_]
In 1979 and 1991 White House Conferences on Library and Information Services
(WHCLIS) were held to demonstrate the key role libraries play in American
democracy._[_8_2_]
The American Library Association (ALA) continues to play a major role in
libraries to this day, with its public library focused division, the Public
Library Association, establishing standards and planning guidelines._[_8_3_]
Dewey's classification system, although under heavy criticism of late,[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n
_n_e_e_d_e_d] still remains the prevailing method of classification used in the
United States.
As the number of books in libraries increased, so did the need for compact
storage and access with adequate lighting, giving birth to the stack system,
which involved keeping a library's collection of books in a space separate from
the reading room. This arrangement arose in the 19th century. Book stacks
quickly evolved into a fairly standard form in which the _c_a_s_t_ _i_r_o_n and _s_t_e_e_l
frameworks supporting the bookshelves also supported the floors, which often
were built of translucent blocks to permit the passage of light (but were not
transparent, for reasons of modesty). The introduction of _e_l_e_c_t_r_i_c_a_l_ _l_i_g_h_t_i_n_g
had a huge impact on how the library _o_p_e_r_a_t_e_d. The use of glass floors was
largely discontinued, though floors were still often composed of metal grating
to allow air to circulate in multi-story stacks. As more space was needed, a
method of moving shelves on tracks (compact shelving) was introduced to cut
down on otherwise wasted aisle space.
In China, there were 2,925 public libraries in 2011._[_8_4_]
_L_i_b_r_a_r_y_ _2_._0, a term coined in 2005, is the library's response to the challenge
of Google and an attempt to meet the changing needs of users by using _w_e_b_ _2_._0
technology. Some of the aspects of Library 2.0 include, commenting, tagging,
bookmarking, discussions, use of online social networks by libraries, plug-ins,
and widgets._[_8_5_] Inspired by web 2.0, it is an attempt to make the library a
more user-driven institution.
Despite the importance of public libraries, they are routinely having their
budgets cut by state legislature. Funding has dwindled so badly that some
smaller public libraries have been forced to cut their hours and release
employees.

An academic library is generally located on the campuses of colleges and
universities and serve primarily the students and faculty of that and other
academic institutions. Some academic libraries, especially those at public
institutions, are accessible to members of the general public in whole or in
part.
Academic libraries are libraries that are hosted in post-secondary educational
institutions, such as colleges and universities. The main functions of an
academic library are to provide resources and research support for students and
faculty of the educational institution. Specific course-related resources are
usually provided by the library, such as copies of textbooks and article
readings held on 'reserve' (meaning that they are loaned out only on a short-
term basis, usually a matter of hours).
Academic libraries offer workshops and courses outside of formal, graded
coursework, which are meant to provide students with the tools necessary to
succeed in their programs._[_8_6_] These workshops may include help with citations,
effective search techniques, journal databases, and electronic citation
software. These workshops provide students with skills that can help them
achieve success in their academic careers (and often, in their future
occupations), which they may not learn inside the classroom.
The academic library provides a quiet study space for students on campus; it
may also provide group study space, such as meeting rooms. In North America,
Europe, and other parts of the world, academic libraries are becoming
increasingly digitally oriented. The library provides a "gateway" for students
and researchers to access various resources, both print/physical and digital.
_[_8_7_] Academic institutions are subscribing to electronic journals databases,
providing research and scholarly writing software, and usually provide computer
workstations or computer labs for students to access journals, library search
databases and portals, institutional electronic resources, internet access, and
course- or task-related software (i.e. word processing and spreadsheet
software). They are increasingly acting as an electronic repository for
institutional scholarly research and academic knowledge, such as the collection
and curation of digital copies of students' theses and dissertations._[_8_8_]_[_8_9_]

Children's libraries are special collections of books intended for juvenile
readers and usually kept in separate rooms of general public libraries. Some
children's libraries have entire floors or wings dedicated to them in bigger
libraries while smaller ones may have a separate room or area for children.
They are an educational agency seeking to acquaint the young with the world's
literature and to cultivate a love for reading. Their work supplements that of
the public schools._[_9_0_]
Services commonly provided by public libraries may include storytelling
sessions for infants, toddlers, preschool children, or after-school programs,
all with an intention of developing early literacy skills and a love of books.
One of the most popular programs offered in public libraries are summer reading
programs for children, families, and adults.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]
Another popular reading program for children is PAWS TO READ or similar
programs where children can read to certified therapy dogs. Since animals are a
calming influence and there is no judgment children learn confidence and a love
of reading. Many states have these types of programs parents just have to ask
their librarian to see if it is available at their local library._[_9_1_]

All other libraries fall into the "_s_p_e_c_i_a_l_ _l_i_b_r_a_r_y" category. Many private
businesses and public organizations, including hospitals, museums, research
laboratories, law firms, and many government departments and agencies, maintain
their own libraries for the use of their employees in doing specialized
research related to their work. Depending on the particular institution,
special libraries may or may not be accessible to the general public or
elements thereof. In more specialized institutions such as law firms and
research laboratories, librarians employed in special libraries are commonly
specialists in the institution's field rather than generally trained
librarians, and often are not required to have advanced degrees in specifically
library-related field due to the specialized content and clientele of the
library.
Some special libraries, such as governmental law libraries, hospital libraries,
and military base libraries commonly are open to public visitors to the
institution in question. Depending on the particular library and the clientele
it serves, special libraries may offer services similar to research, reference,
public, academic, or children's libraries, often with restrictions such as only
lending books to patients at a hospital or restricting the public from parts of
a military collection. Given the highly individual nature of special libraries,
visitors to a special library are often advised to check what services and
restrictions apply at that particular library.
Special libraries are distinguished from _s_p_e_c_i_a_l_ _c_o_l_l_e_c_t_i_o_n_s, which are
branches or parts of a library intended for rare books, manuscripts, and other
special materials, though some special libraries have special collections of
their own, typically related to the library's specialized subject area.

Librarians have sometimes complained that some of the library buildings which
have been used to accommodate libraries have been inadequate for the demands
made upon them. In general this condition may have resulted from one or more of
the following causes:
   1. an effort to erect a _m_o_n_u_m_e_n_t_a_l building[_v_a_g_u_e]; most of those who
      commission library buildings are not librarians and their priorities may
      be different
   2. to conform it to a type of _a_r_c_h_i_t_e_c_t_u_r_e unsuited to library purposes
   3. the appointment, often by competition, of an architect unschooled in the
      requirements of a library
   4. failure to consult with the librarian or with library experts
Much advancement has undoubtedly been made toward cooperation between architect
and librarian,[_w_h_e_n_?] and many good designers have made library buildings their
specialty, nevertheless it seems that the ideal type of library is not yet
realized â€” the type so adapted to its purpose that it would be immediately
recognized as such, as is the case with school buildings at the present time.
[_w_h_e_n_?] This does not mean that library constructions should conform rigidly to
a fixed standard of appearance and arrangement, but it does mean that the
exterior should express as nearly as possible the purpose and functions of the
interior._[_9_5_]

Until the advent of digital catalogues, _c_a_r_d_ _c_a_t_a_l_o_g_u_e_s were the traditional
method of organizing the list of resources and their location within a large
library
_D_y_n_i_x was an early, but long-lasting and popular, digital catalogue.
Patrons may not know how to fully use the library's resources. This can be due
to some individuals' unease in approaching a staff member. Ways in which a
library's content is displayed or accessed may have the most impact on use. An
antiquated or clumsy search system, or staff unwilling or untrained to engage
their patrons, will limit a library's usefulness. In the _p_u_b_l_i_c_ _l_i_b_r_a_r_i_e_s of
the United States, beginning in the 19th century, these problems drove the
emergence of the _l_i_b_r_a_r_y_ _i_n_s_t_r_u_c_t_i_o_n movement, which advocated library user
education. One of the early leaders was _J_o_h_n_ _C_o_t_t_o_n_ _D_a_n_a. The basic form of
library instruction is sometimes known as _i_n_f_o_r_m_a_t_i_o_n_ _l_i_t_e_r_a_c_y.
Libraries should inform their users of what materials are available in their
collections and how to access that information. Before the computer age, this
was accomplished by the card _c_a_t_a_l_o_g_u_e â€” a cabinet (or multiple cabinets)
containing many drawers filled with _i_n_d_e_x_ _c_a_r_d_s that identified books and other
materials. In a large library, the card catalogue often filled a large room.
The emergence of the _I_n_t_e_r_n_e_t, however, has led to the adoption of electronic
catalogue databases (often referred to as "webcats" or as _o_n_l_i_n_e_ _p_u_b_l_i_c_ _a_c_c_e_s_s
_c_a_t_a_l_o_g_u_e_s, OPACs), which allow users to search the library's holdings from any
location with Internet access. This style of catalogue maintenance is
compatible with new types of libraries, such as _d_i_g_i_t_a_l_ _l_i_b_r_a_r_i_e_s and
_d_i_s_t_r_i_b_u_t_e_d_ _l_i_b_r_a_r_i_e_s, as well as older libraries that have been _r_e_t_r_o_f_i_t_t_e_d.
Electronic catalogue databases are criticized by some who believe that the old
card catalogue system was both easier to navigate and allowed retention of
information, by writing directly on the cards, that is lost in the electronic
systems._[_9_6_] This argument is analogous to the debate over paper books and _e_-
_b_o_o_k_s. While libraries have been accused of precipitously throwing out valuable
information in card catalogues, most modern ones have nonetheless made the move
to electronic catalogue databases. Large libraries may be scattered within
multiple buildings across a town, each having multiple floors, with multiple
rooms housing the resources across a series of shelves. Once a user has located
a resource within the catalogue, they must then use navigational guidance to
retrieve the resource physically; a process that may be assisted through
signage, maps, GPS systems or RFID tagging.
_F_i_n_l_a_n_d has the highest number of registered book borrowers per capita in the
world. Over half of Finland's population are registered borrowers._[_9_7_] In the
U.S., public library users have borrowed on average roughly 15 books per user
per year from 1856 to 1978. From 1978 to 2004, book circulation per user
declined approximately 50%. The growth of audiovisuals circulation, estimated
at 25% of total circulation in 2004, accounts for about half of this decline.

In the 21st century there has been increasing use of the Internet to gather and
retrieve data. The shift to digital libraries has greatly impacted the way
people use physical libraries. Between 2002 and 2004, the average American
academic library saw the overall number of transactions decline approximately
2.2%._[_9_9_] Libraries are trying to keep up with the digital world and the new
generation of students that are used to having information just one click away.
For example, the University of California Library System saw a 54% decline in
circulation between 1991 to 2001 of 8,377,000 books to 3,832,000._[_1_0_0_]
These facts might be a consequence of the increased availability of e-
resources. In 1999â€“2000, 105 ARL university libraries spent almost $100
million on electronic resources, which is an increase of nearly $23 million
from the previous year._[_1_0_1_] A 2003 report by the Open E-book Forum found that
close to a million e-books had been sold in 2002, generating nearly $8 million
in revenue._[_1_0_2_] Another example of the shift to digital libraries can be seen
in _C_u_s_h_i_n_g_ _A_c_a_d_e_m_yâ€™s decision to dispense with its library of printed books
â€” more than 20,000 volumes in all â€” and switch over entirely to digital
media resources._[_1_0_3_]

One claim to why there is a decrease in the usage of libraries stems from the
observation of the research habits of undergraduate students enrolled in
colleges and universities. There have been claims that college undergraduates
have become more used to retrieving information from the Internet than a
traditional library. As each generation becomes more in tune with the Internet,
their desire to retrieve information as quickly and easily as possible has
increased. Finding information by simply searching the Internet could be much
easier and faster than reading an entire book. In a survey conducted by
NetLibrary, 93% of undergraduate students claimed that finding information
online makes more sense to them than going to the library. Also, 75% of
students surveyed claimed that they did not have enough time to go to the
library and that they liked the convenience of the Internet. While the
retrieving information from the Internet may be efficient and time saving than
visiting a traditional library, research has shown that undergraduates are most
likely searching only .03% of the entire web._[_1_0_4_] The information that they
are finding might be easy to retrieve and more readily available, but may not
be as in depth as information from other resources such as the books available
at a physical library.
In the mid-2000s Swedish company _D_i_s_t_e_c invented a library book vending machine
known as the _G_o_L_i_b_r_a_r_y, that offers library books to people where there is no
branch, limited hours, or high traffic locations such as _E_l_ _C_e_r_r_i_t_o_ _d_e_l_ _N_o_r_t_e

A library may make use of the _I_n_t_e_r_n_e_t in a number of ways. A library may make

resources such as journal articles and research papers. The _O_n_l_i_n_e_ _C_o_m_p_u_t_e_r

Library scholars have acknowledged that libraries need to address the ways that
they market their services if they are to compete with the Internet and
mitigate the risk of losing users._[_1_1_6_] This includes promoting the information
literacy skills training considered vital across the library profession._[_1_1_4_]
_[_1_1_7_]_[_1_1_8_] However, marketing of services has to be adequately supported
financially in order to be successful. This can be problematic for library
services that are publicly funded and find it difficult to justify diverting
tight funds to apparently peripheral areas such as branding and marketing._[_1_1_9_]

In the United States, state library agencies have oversight of the public
library situation within their boundaries. State library legislation has
concerned itself mainly with the following topics:
   1. founding of libraries
   2. their administration and supervision by library commissions, etc.
   3. development of school libraries
   4. development of country and rural libraries
   5. development of _t_r_a_v_e_l_i_n_g_ _l_i_b_r_a_r_i_e_s
Legislative reference bureaus and provision for popular lectures and for
educational extension by means of the library are provided for by some states.

The centrality of the _Q_u_r_Ê_¾_Ä__n as the prototype of the written word in _I_s_l_a_m
bears significantly on the role of books within its intellectual tradition and
educational system._[_1_2_9_] An early impulse in Islam was to manage reports of
events, key figures and their sayings and actions. Thus, "the onus of being the
last '_P_e_o_p_l_e_ _o_f_ _t_h_e_ _B_o_o_k' engendered an ethos of [librarianship]"_[_1_3_0_] early on
and the establishment of important book repositories throughout the Muslim
world has occurred ever since.
Upon the spread of Islam, libraries in _n_e_w_l_y_ _I_s_l_a_m_i_c_ _l_a_n_d_s knew a brief period
of expansion in the Middle East, _N_o_r_t_h_ _A_f_r_i_c_a, _S_i_c_i_l_y and _S_p_a_i_n. Like the
Christian libraries, they mostly contained books which were made of _p_a_p_e_r, and
took a _c_o_d_e_x or modern form instead of scrolls; they could be found in mosques,
private homes, and universities, from _T_i_m_b_u_k_t_u to _A_f_g_h_a_n_i_s_t_a_n and modern day
_P_a_k_i_s_t_a_n. In _A_l_e_p_p_o, for example, the largest and probably the oldest mosque
library, the Sufiya, located at the city's Grand Umayyad Mosque, contained a
large book collection of which 10,000 volumes were reportedly bequeathed by the
city's most famous ruler, Prince Sayf al-Dawla._[_1_3_1_] _I_b_n_ _a_l_-_N_a_d_i_m's
bibliography Fihrist demonstrates the devotion of medieval Muslim scholars to
books and reliable sources; it contains a description of thousands of books
circulating in the Islamic world circa 1000, including an entire section for
books about the doctrines of other religions. Modern Islamic libraries for the
most part do not hold these antique books; many were lost, _d_e_s_t_r_o_y_e_d_ _b_y

      the same office went to a Greek, Ti. Julius Celsus Polemaeanus, who
      belonged to a family of priests of Rome hailing from Sardis; entering the
      Senate under Vespasian, he was subsequently to be appointed proconsul of
      Asia under Trajan, possibly in 105/6. Celsusâ€™ son, Aquila, was also to
      be made suffectus in 110, although he is certainly remembered more as the
      builder of the famous library his father envisioned for Ephesus."
