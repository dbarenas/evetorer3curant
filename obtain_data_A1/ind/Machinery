MMaacchhiinneess employ power to achieve desired forces and movement. A _m_a_c_h_i_n_e has a
power source and actuators that generate forces and movement, and a system of
_m_e_c_h_a_n_i_s_m_s that shape the actuator input to achieve a specific application of
output forces and movement. Modern machines often include computers and sensors
that monitor performance and plan movement, and are called _m_e_c_h_a_n_i_c_a_l_ _s_y_s_t_e_m_s.
The meaning of the word "machine" is traced by the Oxford English Dictionary_[_1_]
to an independently functioning structure and by Merriam-Webster Dictionary_[_2_]
to something that has been constructed. This includes human design into the
meaning of machine.
The adjective "mechanical" refers to skill in the practical application of an
art or science, as well as relating to or caused by movement, physical forces,
properties or agents such as is dealt with by _m_e_c_h_a_n_i_c_s._[_1_] Similarly Merriam-
Webster Dictionary_[_3_] defines "mechanical" as relating to machinery or tools.
Power flow through a machine provides a way to understand the performance of
devices ranging from levers and gear trains to automobiles and robotic systems.
The German _m_e_c_h_a_n_i_c_i_a_n _F_r_a_n_z_ _R_e_u_l_e_a_u_x_[_4_] wrote "a machine is a combination of
resistant bodies so arranged that by their means the mechanical forces of
nature can be compelled to do work accompanied by certain determinate motion."
Notice that forces and motion combine to define _p_o_w_e_r.
More recently, Uicker et al._[_5_] state that a machine is "a device for applying
power or changing its direction." And McCarthy and Soh_[_6_] describe a machine as
a system that "generally consists of a power source and a _m_e_c_h_a_n_i_s_m for the
controlled use of this power."

The idea that a machine can be decomposed into simple movable elements led
_A_r_c_h_i_m_e_d_e_s to define the _l_e_v_e_r, _p_u_l_l_e_y and _s_c_r_e_w as _s_i_m_p_l_e_ _m_a_c_h_i_n_e_s. By the
time of the Renaissance this list increased to include the _w_h_e_e_l_ _a_n_d_ _a_x_l_e,
_w_e_d_g_e and _i_n_c_l_i_n_e_d_ _p_l_a_n_e. The modern approach to characterizing machines
focusses on the components that allow movement, known as _j_o_i_n_t_s.
Flint hand axe found in _W_i_n_c_h_e_s_t_e_r
WWeeddggee ((hhaanndd aaxxee)):: Perhaps the first example of a device designed to manage
power is the _h_a_n_d_ _a_x_e, also see _b_i_f_a_c_e and _O_l_o_r_g_e_s_a_i_l_i_e. A hand axe is made by
chipping stone, generally flint, to form a bifacial edge, or _w_e_d_g_e. A wedge is
a simple machine that transforms lateral force and movement of the tool into a
transverse splitting force and movement of the workpiece. The available power
is limited by the effort of the person using the tool, but because power is the
product of force and movement, the wedge amplifies the force by reducing the
movement. This amplification, or _m_e_c_h_a_n_i_c_a_l_ _a_d_v_a_n_t_a_g_e is the ratio of the input
speed to output speed. For a wedge this is given by 1/tanÎ±, where Î± is the
tip angle. The faces of a wedge are modeled as straight lines to form a sliding
or _p_r_i_s_m_a_t_i_c_ _j_o_i_n_t.
LLeevveerr:: The _l_e_v_e_r is another important and simple device for managing power.
This is a body that pivots on a fulcrum. Because the velocity of a point
farther from the pivot is greater than the velocity of a point near the pivot,
forces applied far from the pivot are amplified near the pivot by the
associated decrease in speed. If a is the distance from the pivot to the point
where the input force is applied and b is the distance to the point where the
output force is applied, then a/b is the _m_e_c_h_a_n_i_c_a_l_ _a_d_v_a_n_t_a_g_e of the lever. The
fulcrum of a lever is modeled as a hinged or _r_e_v_o_l_u_t_e_ _j_o_i_n_t.
WWhheeeell:: The _w_h_e_e_l is clearly an important early machine, such as the _c_h_a_r_i_o_t. A
wheel uses the law of the lever to reduce the force needed to overcome _f_r_i_c_t_i_o_n
when pulling a load. To see this notice that the friction associated with
pulling a load on the ground is approximately the same as the friction in a
simple bearing that supports the load on the axle of a wheel. However, the
wheel forms a lever that magnifies the pulling force so that it overcomes the
frictional resistance in the bearing.

Natural forces such as wind and water powered larger mechanical systems.
_W_a_t_e_r_w_h_e_e_l_s appeared around the world around 300 BC to use flowing water to
generate rotary motion, which was applied to _m_i_l_l_i_n_g_ _g_r_a_i_n_,_ _a_n_d_ _p_o_w_e_r_i_n_g

flowing through a _d_a_m to drive an _e_l_e_c_t_r_i_c_ _g_e_n_e_r_a_t_o_r. Early _w_i_n_d_m_i_l_l_s captured
wind power to generate rotary motion for milling operations. Modern _w_i_n_d
_t_u_r_b_i_n_e_s also drives a generator. This electricity in turn is used to drive
_m_o_t_o_r_s forming the actuators of mechanical systems.
The word engine derives from "ingenuity" and originally referred to
contrivances that may or may not be physical devices. See _M_e_r_r_i_a_m_-_W_e_b_s_t_e_r_'_s

pressure vessel; the expanding steam drives a piston or a turbine. This
principle can be seen in the _a_e_o_l_i_p_i_l_e of Hero of Alexandria. This is called an

fuel (an _e_x_o_t_h_e_r_m_i_c chemical reaction) inside a cylinder and uses the expanding
gases to drive a _p_i_s_t_o_n. A _j_e_t_ _e_n_g_i_n_e uses a turbine to compress air which is
burned with fuel so that it expands through a nozzle to provide thrust to an
_a_i_r_c_r_a_f_t, and so is also an "internal combustion engine." _[_7_]
The heat from coal and natural gas combustion in a _b_o_i_l_e_r generates steam that
drives a _s_t_e_a_m_ _t_u_r_b_i_n_e to rotate an _e_l_e_c_t_r_i_c_ _g_e_n_e_r_a_t_o_r. A _n_u_c_l_e_a_r_ _p_o_w_e_r_ _p_l_a_n_t
uses heat from a _n_u_c_l_e_a_r_ _r_e_a_c_t_o_r to generate steam and _e_l_e_c_t_r_i_c_ _p_o_w_e_r. This
power is distributed through a _n_e_t_w_o_r_k_ _o_f_ _t_r_a_n_s_m_i_s_s_i_o_n_ _l_i_n_e_s for industrial and

A _l_i_n_k_a_g_e is a collection of links connected by joints. Generally, the links
are the structural elements and the joints allow movement. Perhaps the single
most useful example is the planar _f_o_u_r_-_b_a_r_ _l_i_n_k_a_g_e. However, there are many
more special linkages:
    * _W_a_t_t_'_s_ _l_i_n_k_a_g_e is a four-bar linkage that generates an approximate
      straight line. It was critical to the operation of his design for the
      steam engine. This linkage also appears in vehicle suspensions to prevent
      side-to-side movement of the body relative to the wheels. Also see the
      article _P_a_r_a_l_l_e_l_ _m_o_t_i_o_n.
    * The success of Watt's linkage lead to the design of similar approximate
      straight-line linkages, such as _H_o_e_k_e_n_'_s_ _l_i_n_k_a_g_e and _C_h_e_b_y_s_h_e_v_'_s_ _l_i_n_k_a_g_e.

A number of machine elements provide important structural functions such as the
frame, bearings, splines, spring and seals.

The _d_y_n_a_m_i_c_ _a_n_a_l_y_s_i_s of machines begins with a rigid-body model to determine
reactions at the bearings, at which point the elasticity effects are included.
The _r_i_g_i_d_-_b_o_d_y_ _d_y_n_a_m_i_c_s studies the movement of systems of interconnected
bodies under the action of external forces. The assumption that the bodies are
rigid, which means that they do not deform under the action of applied forces,
simplifies the analysis by reducing the parameters that describe the
configuration of the system to the translation and rotation of reference frames
attached to each body._[_9_]_[_1_0_]
The dynamics of a rigid body system is defined by its _e_q_u_a_t_i_o_n_s_ _o_f_ _m_o_t_i_o_n,

The solution of these equations of motion defines how the configuration of the
system of rigid bodies changes as a function of time. The formulation and

The dynamic analysis of a machine requires the determination of the movement,
or _k_i_n_e_m_a_t_i_c_s, of its component parts, know as kinematic analysis. The
assumption that the system is an assembly of rigid components allows rotational

_t_r_a_n_s_f_o_r_m_a_t_i_o_n_s. This allows the position, velocity and acceleration of all

point, and the angular position, angular velocity and angular acceleration of
the component.

The classification of _s_i_m_p_l_e_ _m_a_c_h_i_n_e_s to provide a strategy for the design of
new machines was developed by Franz Reuleaux, who collected and studied over
800 elementary machines. He recognized that the classical _s_i_m_p_l_e_ _m_a_c_h_i_n_e_s can
be separated into the lever, pulley and wheel and axle that are formed by a
body rotating about a hinge, and the inclined plane, wedge and screw that are
similarly a block sliding on a flat surface._[_1_1_]
Simple machines are elementary examples of _k_i_n_e_m_a_t_i_c_ _c_h_a_i_n_s or _l_i_n_k_a_g_e_s that
are used to model _m_e_c_h_a_n_i_c_a_l_ _s_y_s_t_e_m_s ranging from the steam engine to robot
manipulators. The bearings that form the fulcrum of a lever and that allow the
wheel and axle and pulleys to rotate are examples of a _k_i_n_e_m_a_t_i_c_ _p_a_i_r called a
hinged joint. Similarly, the flat surface of an inclined plane and wedge are
examples of the _k_i_n_e_m_a_t_i_c_ _p_a_i_r called a sliding joint. The screw is usually
identified as its own kinematic pair called a helical joint.
This realization shows that it is the joints, or the connections that provide
movement, that are the primary elements of a machine. Starting with four types
of joints, the rotary joint, sliding joint, cam joint and gear joint, and
related connections such as cables and belts, it is possible to understand a
machine as an assembly of solid parts that connect these joints called a
_m_e_c_h_a_n_i_s_m ._[_5_]

While all mechanisms in a mechanical system are three dimensional, they can be
analyzed using _p_l_a_n_e_ _g_e_o_m_e_t_r_y, if the movement of the individual components are
constrained so all point trajectories are parallel to a plane. In this case the
system is called a planar mechanism. The kinematic analysis of planar
mechanisms uses the subset of SE(3) consisting of planar rotations and
translations, denote SE(2).
The group SE(2) is three dimensional, which means that every position of a body
in the plane is defined by three parameters. The parameters are often the x and
y coordinates of the origin of a coordinate frame in M measured from the origin
of a coordinate frame in F, and the angle measured from the x-axis in F to the
x-axis in M. This is often described saying a body in the plane has three
_d_e_g_r_e_e_s_-_o_f_-_f_r_e_e_d_o_m.
The pure rotation of a hinge and the linear translation of a slider can be
identified with subgroups of SE(2), and define the two joints one degree-of-
freedom joints of planar mechanisms. The cam joint formed by two surfaces in
sliding and rotating contact is a two degree-of-freedom joint.

It is possible to construct a mechanism such that the point trajectories in all
components lie in concentric spherical shells around a fixed point. An example
is the _g_i_m_b_a_l_e_d _g_y_r_o_s_c_o_p_e. These devices are called spherical mechanisms._[_6_]
Spherical mechanisms are constructed by connecting links with hinged joints
such that the axes of each hinge passes through the same point. This point
becomes center of the concentric spherical shells. The movement of these
mechanisms is characterized by the group SO(3) of rotations in three
dimensional space. Other examples of spherical mechanisms are the _a_u_t_o_m_o_t_i_v_e
_d_i_f_f_e_r_e_n_t_i_a_l and the robotic wrist.

A mechanism in which a body moves through a general spatial movement is called
a spatial mechanism. An example is the RSSR linkage, which can be viewed as a
four-bar linkage in which the hinged joints of the coupler link are replaced by
_r_o_d_ _e_n_d_s, also called spherical joints or _b_a_l_l_ _j_o_i_n_t_s. The rod ends allow the
input and output cranks of the RSSR linkage to be misaligned to the point that
they lie in different planes, which causes the coupler link to move in a
general spatial movement. _R_o_b_o_t_ _a_r_m_s, _S_t_e_w_a_r_t_ _p_l_a_t_f_o_r_m_s, and _h_u_m_a_n_o_i_d_ _r_o_b_o_t_i_c

The group _S_E_(_3_) is six dimensional, which means the position of a body in space
is defined by six parameters. Three of the parameters define the origin of the
moving reference frame relative to the fixed frame. Three other parameters
define the orientation of the moving frame relative to the fixed frame.
