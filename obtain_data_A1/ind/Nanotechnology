NNaannootteecchhnnoollooggyy (sometimes shortened to "nnaannootteecchh") is the manipulation of
matter on an _a_t_o_m_i_c and _m_o_l_e_c_u_l_a_r scale. The earliest, widespread description
of nanotechnology_[_1_]_[_2_] referred to the particular technological goal of
precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale
products, also now referred to as _m_o_l_e_c_u_l_a_r_ _n_a_n_o_t_e_c_h_n_o_l_o_g_y. A more generalized
description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the _N_a_t_i_o_n_a_l
_N_a_n_o_t_e_c_h_n_o_l_o_g_y_ _I_n_i_t_i_a_t_i_v_e, which defines nanotechnology as the manipulation of
matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 _n_a_n_o_m_e_t_e_r_s. This
definition reflects the fact that _q_u_a_n_t_u_m_ _m_e_c_h_a_n_i_c_a_l effects are important at
this _q_u_a_n_t_u_m_-_r_e_a_l_m scale, and so the definition shifted from a particular
technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research
and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter that occur
below the given size threshold. It is therefore common to see the plural form
"nanotechnologies" as well as "nanoscale technologies" to refer to the broad
range of research and applications whose common trait is size. Because of the
variety of potential applications (including industrial and military),
governments have invested billions of dollars in nanotechnology research.
Through its National Nanotechnology Initiative, the USA has invested 3.7
billion dollars. The European Union has invested 1.2 billion and Japan 750
million dollars._[_3_]
Nanotechnology as defined by size is naturally very broad, including fields of
science as diverse as _s_u_r_f_a_c_e_ _s_c_i_e_n_c_e, _o_r_g_a_n_i_c_ _c_h_e_m_i_s_t_r_y, _m_o_l_e_c_u_l_a_r_ _b_i_o_l_o_g_y,
_s_e_m_i_c_o_n_d_u_c_t_o_r_ _p_h_y_s_i_c_s, _m_i_c_r_o_f_a_b_r_i_c_a_t_i_o_n, etc._[_4_] The associated research and
applications are equally diverse, ranging from extensions of conventional
_d_e_v_i_c_e_ _p_h_y_s_i_c_s to completely new approaches based upon _m_o_l_e_c_u_l_a_r_ _s_e_l_f_-_a_s_s_e_m_b_l_y,
from developing _n_e_w_ _m_a_t_e_r_i_a_l_s with dimensions on the nanoscale to _d_i_r_e_c_t
_c_o_n_t_r_o_l_ _o_f_ _m_a_t_t_e_r_ _o_n_ _t_h_e_ _a_t_o_m_i_c_ _s_c_a_l_e.
Scientists currently debate the future _i_m_p_l_i_c_a_t_i_o_n_s_ _o_f_ _n_a_n_o_t_e_c_h_n_o_l_o_g_y.
Nanotechnology may be able to create many new materials and devices with a vast
range of _a_p_p_l_i_c_a_t_i_o_n_s, such as in _m_e_d_i_c_i_n_e, _e_l_e_c_t_r_o_n_i_c_s, _b_i_o_m_a_t_e_r_i_a_l_s and
energy production. On the other hand, nanotechnology raises many of the same
issues as any new technology, including concerns about the _t_o_x_i_c_i_t_y and
environmental impact of nanomaterials,_[_5_] and their potential effects on global
economics, as well as speculation about various _d_o_o_m_s_d_a_y_ _s_c_e_n_a_r_i_o_s. These
concerns have led to a debate among advocacy groups and governments on whether
special _r_e_g_u_l_a_t_i_o_n_ _o_f_ _n_a_n_o_t_e_c_h_n_o_l_o_g_y is warranted.

The concepts that seeded nanotechnology were first discussed in 1959 by
renowned physicist _R_i_c_h_a_r_d_ _F_e_y_n_m_a_n in his talk _T_h_e_r_e_'_s_ _P_l_e_n_t_y_ _o_f_ _R_o_o_m_ _a_t_ _t_h_e
_B_o_t_t_o_m, in which he described the possibility of synthesis via direct
manipulation of atoms. The term "nano-technology" was first used by _N_o_r_i_o
_T_a_n_i_g_u_c_h_i in 1974, though it was not widely known.
Inspired by Feynman's concepts, _K_._ _E_r_i_c_ _D_r_e_x_l_e_r independently used the term
"nanotechnology" in his 1986 book _E_n_g_i_n_e_s_ _o_f_ _C_r_e_a_t_i_o_n_:_ _T_h_e_ _C_o_m_i_n_g_ _E_r_a_ _o_f
_N_a_n_o_t_e_c_h_n_o_l_o_g_y, which proposed the idea of a nanoscale "assembler" which would
be able to build a copy of itself and of other items of arbitrary complexity
with atomic control. Also in 1986, Drexler co-founded _T_h_e_ _F_o_r_e_s_i_g_h_t_ _I_n_s_t_i_t_u_t_e
(with which he is no longer affiliated) to help increase public awareness and
understanding of nanotechnology concepts and implications.
Thus, emergence of nanotechnology as a field in the 1980s occurred through
convergence of Drexler's theoretical and public work, which developed and
popularized a conceptual framework for nanotechnology, and high-visibility
experimental advances that drew additional wide-scale attention to the
prospects of atomic control of matter.
For example, the invention of the _s_c_a_n_n_i_n_g_ _t_u_n_n_e_l_i_n_g_ _m_i_c_r_o_s_c_o_p_e in 1981
provided unprecedented visualization of individual atoms and bonds, and was
successfully used to manipulate individual atoms in 1989. The microscope's
developers _G_e_r_d_ _B_i_n_n_i_g and _H_e_i_n_r_i_c_h_ _R_o_h_r_e_r at _I_B_M_ _Z_u_r_i_c_h_ _R_e_s_e_a_r_c_h_ _L_a_b_o_r_a_t_o_r_y
received a _N_o_b_e_l_ _P_r_i_z_e_ _i_n_ _P_h_y_s_i_c_s in 1986._[_6_]_[_7_] Binnig, _Q_u_a_t_e and Gerber also
invented the analogous _a_t_o_m_i_c_ _f_o_r_c_e_ _m_i_c_r_o_s_c_o_p_e that year.
Buckminsterfullerene C60, also known as the _b_u_c_k_y_b_a_l_l, is a representative
member of the _c_a_r_b_o_n_ _s_t_r_u_c_t_u_r_e_s known as _f_u_l_l_e_r_e_n_e_s. Members of the fullerene
family are a major subject of research falling under the nanotechnology
umbrella.
_F_u_l_l_e_r_e_n_e_s were discovered in 1985 by _H_a_r_r_y_ _K_r_o_t_o, _R_i_c_h_a_r_d_ _S_m_a_l_l_e_y, and _R_o_b_e_r_t
_C_u_r_l, who together won the 1996 _N_o_b_e_l_ _P_r_i_z_e_ _i_n_ _C_h_e_m_i_s_t_r_y._[_8_]_[_9_] C60 was not
initially described as nanotechnology; the term was used regarding subsequent
work with related _g_r_a_p_h_e_n_e tubes (called _c_a_r_b_o_n_ _n_a_n_o_t_u_b_e_s and sometimes called
Bucky tubes) which suggested potential applications for nanoscale electronics
and devices.
In the early 2000s, the field garnered increased scientific, political, and
commercial attention that led to both controversy and progress. Controversies
emerged regarding the definitions and potential implications of
nanotechnologies, exemplified by the _R_o_y_a_l_ _S_o_c_i_e_t_y's report on nanotechnology.
_[_1_0_] Challenges were raised regarding the feasibility of applications
envisioned by advocates of molecular nanotechnology, which culminated in a
public debate between Drexler and Smalley in 2001 and 2003._[_1_1_]
Meanwhile, commercialization of products based on advancements in nanoscale
technologies began emerging. These products are limited to bulk applications of
_n_a_n_o_m_a_t_e_r_i_a_l_s and do not involve atomic control of matter. Some examples
include the _S_i_l_v_e_r_ _N_a_n_o platform for using _s_i_l_v_e_r_ _n_a_n_o_p_a_r_t_i_c_l_e_s as an
antibacterial agent, _n_a_n_o_p_a_r_t_i_c_l_e-based transparent sunscreens, and _c_a_r_b_o_n
_n_a_n_o_t_u_b_e_s for stain-resistant textiles._[_1_2_]_[_1_3_]
Governments moved to promote and _f_u_n_d_ _r_e_s_e_a_r_c_h into nanotechnology, beginning
in the U.S. with the _N_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _N_a_n_o_t_e_c_h_n_o_l_o_g_y_ _I_n_i_t_i_a_t_i_v_e, which formalized a
size-based definition of nanotechnology and established funding for research on
the nanoscale.
By the mid-2000s new and serious scientific attention began to flourish.
Projects emerged to produce nanotechnology roadmaps_[_1_4_]_[_1_5_] which center on
atomically precise manipulation of matter and discuss existing and projected
capabilities, goals, and applications.

Nanotechnology is the engineering of functional systems at the molecular scale.
This covers both current work and concepts that are more advanced. In its
original sense, nanotechnology refers to the projected ability to construct
items from the bottom up, using techniques and tools being developed today to

One _n_a_n_o_m_e_t_e_r (nm) is one billionth, or 10‚àí9, of a meter. By comparison,
typical carbon-carbon _b_o_n_d_ _l_e_n_g_t_h_s, or the spacing between these _a_t_o_m_s in a
_m_o_l_e_c_u_l_e, are in the range 0.12‚Äì0.15 nm, and a _D_N_A double-helix has a
diameter around 2 nm. On the other hand, the smallest _c_e_l_l_u_l_a_r life-forms, the
bacteria of the genus _M_y_c_o_p_l_a_s_m_a, are around 200 nm in length. By convention,
nanotechnology is taken as the scale range 1 to 100 nm following the definition
used by the National Nanotechnology Initiative in the US. The lower limit is
set by the size of atoms (hydrogen has the smallest atoms, which are
approximately a quarter of a nm diameter) since nanotechnology must build its
devices from atoms and molecules. The upper limit is more or less arbitrary but
is around the size that phenomena not observed in larger structures start to
become apparent and can be made use of in the nano device._[_1_6_] These new
phenomena make nanotechnology distinct from devices which are merely
miniaturised versions of an equivalent _m_a_c_r_o_s_c_o_p_i_c device; such devices are on
a larger scale and come under the description of _m_i_c_r_o_t_e_c_h_n_o_l_o_g_y._[_1_7_]
To put that scale in another context, the comparative size of a nanometer to a
meter is the same as that of a marble to the size of the earth._[_1_8_] Or another
way of putting it: a nanometer is the amount an average man's beard grows in
the time it takes him to raise the razor to his face._[_1_8_]
Two main approaches are used in nanotechnology. In the "bottom-up" approach,
materials and devices are built from molecular components which _a_s_s_e_m_b_l_e
_t_h_e_m_s_e_l_v_e_s chemically by principles of _m_o_l_e_c_u_l_a_r_ _r_e_c_o_g_n_i_t_i_o_n. In the "top-down"
approach, nano-objects are constructed from larger entities without atomic-
level control._[_1_9_]

Several phenomena become pronounced as the size of the system decreases. These
include _s_t_a_t_i_s_t_i_c_a_l_ _m_e_c_h_a_n_i_c_a_l effects, as well as _q_u_a_n_t_u_m_ _m_e_c_h_a_n_i_c_a_l effects,
for example the ‚Äú_q_u_a_n_t_u_m size effect‚Äù where the electronic properties of
solids are altered with great reductions in particle size. This effect does not
come into play by going from macro to micro dimensions. However, quantum
effects can become significant when the nanometer size range is reached,
typically at distances of 100 nanometers or less, the so-called _q_u_a_n_t_u_m_ _r_e_a_l_m.
Additionally, a number of physical (mechanical, electrical, optical, etc.)
properties change when compared to macroscopic systems. One example is the
increase in surface area to volume ratio altering mechanical, thermal and
catalytic properties of materials. Diffusion and reactions at nanoscale,
nanostructures materials and nanodevices with fast ion transport are generally
referred to nanoionics. Mechanical properties of nanosystems are of interest in
the nanomechanics research. The catalytic activity of nanomaterials also opens
potential risks in their interaction with _b_i_o_m_a_t_e_r_i_a_l_s.
Materials reduced to the nanoscale can show different properties compared to
what they exhibit on a macroscale, enabling unique applications. For instance,
opaque substances can become transparent (copper); stable materials can turn
combustible (aluminum); insoluble materials may become soluble (gold). A
material such as gold, which is chemically inert at normal scales, can serve as
a potent chemical _c_a_t_a_l_y_s_t at nanoscales. Much of the fascination with
nanotechnology stems from these quantum and surface phenomena that matter
exhibits at the nanoscale._[_2_0_]

Modern _s_y_n_t_h_e_t_i_c_ _c_h_e_m_i_s_t_r_y has reached the point where it is possible to
prepare small molecules to almost any structure. These methods are used today
to manufacture a wide variety of useful chemicals such as _p_h_a_r_m_a_c_e_u_t_i_c_a_l_s or
commercial _p_o_l_y_m_e_r_s. This ability raises the question of extending this kind of
control to the next-larger level, seeking methods to assemble these single
molecules into _s_u_p_r_a_m_o_l_e_c_u_l_a_r_ _a_s_s_e_m_b_l_i_e_s consisting of many molecules arranged
in a well defined manner.
These approaches utilize the concepts of molecular self-assembly and/or
_s_u_p_r_a_m_o_l_e_c_u_l_a_r_ _c_h_e_m_i_s_t_r_y to automatically arrange themselves into some useful
conformation through a _b_o_t_t_o_m_-_u_p approach. The concept of molecular recognition
is especially important: molecules can be designed so that a specific
configuration or arrangement is favored due to _n_o_n_-_c_o_v_a_l_e_n_t _i_n_t_e_r_m_o_l_e_c_u_l_a_r
_f_o_r_c_e_s. The Watson‚ÄìCrick _b_a_s_e_p_a_i_r_i_n_g rules are a direct result of this, as is
the specificity of an _e_n_z_y_m_e being targeted to a single _s_u_b_s_t_r_a_t_e, or the
specific _f_o_l_d_i_n_g_ _o_f_ _t_h_e_ _p_r_o_t_e_i_n itself. Thus, two or more components can be
designed to be complementary and mutually attractive so that they make a more
complex and useful whole.
Such bottom-up approaches should be capable of producing devices in parallel
and be much cheaper than top-down methods, but could potentially be overwhelmed
as the size and complexity of the desired assembly increases. Most useful
structures require complex and thermodynamically unlikely arrangements of
atoms. Nevertheless, there are many examples of self-assembly based on
molecular recognition in _b_i_o_l_o_g_y, most notably Watson‚ÄìCrick basepairing and
enzyme-substrate interactions. The challenge for nanotechnology is whether
these principles can be used to engineer new constructs in addition to natural
ones.

Molecular nanotechnology, sometimes called molecular manufacturing, describes
engineered nanosystems (nanoscale machines) operating on the molecular scale.
Molecular nanotechnology is especially associated with the _m_o_l_e_c_u_l_a_r_ _a_s_s_e_m_b_l_e_r,
a machine that can produce a desired structure or device atom-by-atom using the
principles of _m_e_c_h_a_n_o_s_y_n_t_h_e_s_i_s. Manufacturing in the context of _p_r_o_d_u_c_t_i_v_e
_n_a_n_o_s_y_s_t_e_m_s is not related to, and should be clearly distinguished from, the
conventional technologies used to manufacture nanomaterials such as carbon
nanotubes and nanoparticles.
When the term "nanotechnology" was independently coined and popularized by _E_r_i_c
_D_r_e_x_l_e_r (who at the time was unaware of an _e_a_r_l_i_e_r_ _u_s_a_g_e by Norio Taniguchi) it
referred to a future manufacturing technology based on _m_o_l_e_c_u_l_a_r_ _m_a_c_h_i_n_e
systems. The premise was that molecular scale biological analogies of
traditional machine components demonstrated molecular machines were possible:
by the countless examples found in biology, it is known that sophisticated,
_s_t_o_c_h_a_s_t_i_c_a_l_l_y optimised biological machines can be produced.
It is hoped that developments in nanotechnology will make possible their
construction by some other means, perhaps using _b_i_o_m_i_m_e_t_i_c principles. However,
Drexler and other researchers_[_2_1_] have proposed that advanced nanotechnology,
although perhaps initially implemented by biomimetic means, ultimately could be
based on mechanical engineering principles, namely, a manufacturing technology
based on the mechanical functionality of these components (such as gears,
bearings, motors, and structural members) that would enable programmable,
positional assembly to atomic specification._[_2_2_] The physics and engineering
performance of exemplar designs were analyzed in Drexler's book Nanosystems.
In general it is very difficult to assemble devices on the atomic scale, as one
has to position atoms on other atoms of comparable size and stickiness. Another
view, put forth by Carlo Montemagno,_[_2_3_] is that future nanosystems will be
hybrids of silicon technology and biological molecular machines. Richard
Smalley argued that mechanosynthesis are impossible due to the difficulties in
mechanically manipulating individual molecules.
This led to an exchange of letters in the _A_C_S publication _C_h_e_m_i_c_a_l_ _&
_E_n_g_i_n_e_e_r_i_n_g_ _N_e_w_s in 2003._[_2_4_] Though biology clearly demonstrates that
molecular machine systems are possible, non-biological molecular machines are
today only in their infancy. Leaders in research on non-biological molecular
machines are Dr. _A_l_e_x_ _Z_e_t_t_l and his colleagues at Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratories and UC Berkeley. They have constructed at least three distinct
molecular devices whose motion is controlled from the desktop with changing
voltage: a nanotube _n_a_n_o_m_o_t_o_r, a molecular actuator,_[_2_5_] and a
nanoelectromechanical relaxation oscillator._[_2_6_] See _n_a_n_o_t_u_b_e_ _n_a_n_o_m_o_t_o_r for
more examples.
An experiment indicating that positional molecular assembly is possible was
performed by Ho and Lee at _C_o_r_n_e_l_l_ _U_n_i_v_e_r_s_i_t_y in 1999. They used a scanning
tunneling microscope to move an individual carbon monoxide molecule (CO) to an
individual iron atom (Fe) sitting on a flat silver crystal, and chemically
bound the CO to the Fe by applying a voltage.

      of several drawbacks of such devices._[_3_9_] Nevertheless, progress on
      innovative materials and methodologies has been demonstrated with some
      patents granted about new nanomanufacturing devices for future commercial
      applications, which also progressively helps in the development towards
      nanorobots with the use of embedded nanobioelectronics concepts._[_4_0_]_[_4_1_]
    * Productive nanosystems are "systems of nanosystems" which will be complex
      nanosystems that produce atomically precise parts for other nanosystems,
      not necessarily using novel nanoscale-emergent properties, but well-
      understood fundamentals of manufacturing. Because of the discrete (i.e.
      atomic) nature of matter and the possibility of exponential growth, this
      stage is seen as the basis of another industrial revolution. _M_i_h_a_i_l_ _R_o_c_o,
      one of the architects of the USA's National Nanotechnology Initiative,
      has proposed four states of nanotechnology that seem to parallel the
      technical progress of the Industrial Revolution, progressing from passive
      nanostructures to active nanodevices to complex _n_a_n_o_m_a_c_h_i_n_e_s and
      ultimately to productive nanosystems._[_4_2_]
    * _P_r_o_g_r_a_m_m_a_b_l_e_ _m_a_t_t_e_r seeks to design materials whose properties can be

    * Due to the popularity and media exposure of the term nanotechnology, the

      it, although these are only used rarely and informally.

Typical _A_F_M setup. A microfabricated _c_a_n_t_i_l_e_v_e_r with a sharp tip is deflected
by features on a sample surface, much like in a _p_h_o_n_o_g_r_a_p_h but on a much
smaller scale. A _l_a_s_e_r beam reflects off the backside of the cantilever into a
set of _p_h_o_t_o_d_e_t_e_c_t_o_r_s, allowing the deflection to be measured and assembled
into an image of the surface.
There are several important modern developments. The atomic force microscope
(AFM) and the _S_c_a_n_n_i_n_g_ _T_u_n_n_e_l_i_n_g_ _M_i_c_r_o_s_c_o_p_e (STM) are two early versions of
scanning probes that launched nanotechnology. There are other types of _s_c_a_n_n_i_n_g
_p_r_o_b_e_ _m_i_c_r_o_s_c_o_p_y. Although conceptually similar to the scanning _c_o_n_f_o_c_a_l
_m_i_c_r_o_s_c_o_p_e developed by _M_a_r_v_i_n_ _M_i_n_s_k_y in 1961 and the _s_c_a_n_n_i_n_g_ _a_c_o_u_s_t_i_c
_m_i_c_r_o_s_c_o_p_e (SAM) developed by _C_a_l_v_i_n_ _Q_u_a_t_e and coworkers in the 1970s, newer
scanning probe microscopes have much higher resolution, since they are not
limited by the wavelength of sound or light.
The tip of a scanning probe can also be used to manipulate nanostructures (a
process called positional assembly). _F_e_a_t_u_r_e_-_o_r_i_e_n_t_e_d_ _s_c_a_n_n_i_n_g methodology
suggested by Rostislav Lapshin appears to be a promising way to implement these
nanomanipulations in automatic mode._[_4_3_]_[_4_4_] However, this is still a slow
process because of low scanning velocity of the microscope.
Various techniques of nanolithography such as _o_p_t_i_c_a_l_ _l_i_t_h_o_g_r_a_p_h_y, _X_-_r_a_y

_l_i_t_h_o_g_r_a_p_h_y were also developed. Lithography is a top-down fabrication
technique where a bulk material is reduced in size to nanoscale pattern.
Another group of nanotechnological techniques include those used for
fabrication of _n_a_n_o_t_u_b_e_s and _n_a_n_o_w_i_r_e_s, those used in semiconductor fabrication
such as deep ultraviolet lithography, electron beam lithography, focused ion
beam machining, nanoimprint lithography, atomic layer deposition, and molecular
vapor deposition, and further including molecular self-assembly techniques such
as those employing di-block copolymers. The precursors of these techniques
preceded the nanotech era, and are extensions in the development of scientific
advancements rather than techniques which were devised with the sole purpose of
creating nanotechnology and which were results of nanotechnology research.
The top-down approach anticipates nanodevices that must be built piece by piece
in stages, much as manufactured items are made. Scanning probe microscopy is an
important technique both for characterization and synthesis of nanomaterials.
Atomic force microscopes and scanning tunneling microscopes can be used to look
at surfaces and to move atoms around. By designing different tips for these
microscopes, they can be used for carving out structures on surfaces and to
help guide self-assembling structures. By using, for example, feature-oriented
scanning approach, atoms or molecules can be moved around on a surface with
scanning probe microscopy techniques._[_4_3_]_[_4_4_] At present, it is expensive and
time-consuming for mass production but very suitable for laboratory
experimentation.
In contrast, bottom-up techniques build or grow larger structures atom by atom
or molecule by molecule. These techniques include chemical synthesis, _s_e_l_f_-
_a_s_s_e_m_b_l_y and positional assembly. _D_u_a_l_ _p_o_l_a_r_i_s_a_t_i_o_n_ _i_n_t_e_r_f_e_r_o_m_e_t_r_y is one tool
suitable for characterisation of self assembled thin films. Another variation
of the bottom-up approach is _m_o_l_e_c_u_l_a_r_ _b_e_a_m_ _e_p_i_t_a_x_y or MBE. Researchers at _B_e_l_l
_T_e_l_e_p_h_o_n_e_ _L_a_b_o_r_a_t_o_r_i_e_s like John R. Arthur. Alfred Y. Cho, and Art C. Gossard
developed and implemented MBE as a research tool in the late 1960s and 1970s.
Samples made by MBE were key to the discovery of the fractional quantum Hall
effect for which the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded. MBE allows
scientists to lay down atomically precise layers of atoms and, in the process,
build up complex structures. Important for research on semiconductors, MBE is
also widely used to make samples and devices for the newly emerging field of
_s_p_i_n_t_r_o_n_i_c_s.
However, new therapeutic products, based on responsive nanomaterials, such as
the ultradeformable, stress-sensitive _T_r_a_n_s_f_e_r_s_o_m_e vesicles, are under
development and already approved for human use in some countries.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n

over 800 manufacturer-identified nanotech products are publicly available, with
new ones hitting the market at a pace of 3‚Äì4 per week._[_1_3_] The project lists
all of the products in a publicly accessible online database. Most applications
are limited to the use of "first generation" passive nanomaterials which
includes titanium dioxide in sunscreen, cosmetics, surface coatings,_[_4_5_] and
some food products; Carbon allotropes used to produce _g_e_c_k_o_ _t_a_p_e; silver in
food packaging, clothing, disinfectants and household appliances; zinc oxide in

field of nanotechnology. His findings are published in the monograph Nano-Hype:
The Truth Behind the Nanotechnology Buzz. This study concludes that much of
what is sold as ‚Äúnanotechnology‚Äù is in fact a recasting of straightforward
materials science, which is leading to a ‚Äúnanotech industry built solely on
selling nanotubes, nanowires, and the like‚Äù which will ‚Äúend up with a few
suppliers selling low margin products in huge volumes." Further applications
which require actual manipulation or arrangement of nanoscale components await
further research. Though technologies branded with the term 'nano' are
sometimes little related to and fall far short of the most ambitious and
transformative technological goals of the sort in molecular manufacturing
proposals, the term still connotes such ideas. According to Berube, there may
be a danger that a "nano bubble" will form, or is forming already, from the use
of the term by scientists and entrepreneurs to garner funding, regardless of
interest in the transformative possibilities of more ambitious and far-sighted
work._[_5_0_]

Calls for tighter regulation of nanotechnology have occurred alongside a
growing debate related to the human health and safety risks of nanotechnology.
_[_7_1_] There is significant debate about who is responsible for the regulation of
nanotechnology. Some regulatory agencies currently cover some nanotechnology
products and processes (to varying degrees) ‚Äì by ‚Äúbolting on‚Äù
nanotechnology to existing regulations ‚Äì there are clear gaps in these
regimes._[_7_2_] Davies (2008) has proposed a regulatory road map describing steps
to deal with these shortcomings._[_7_3_]
Stakeholders concerned by the lack of a regulatory framework to assess and
control risks associated with the release of nanoparticles and nanotubes have
drawn parallels with _b_o_v_i_n_e_ _s_p_o_n_g_i_f_o_r_m_ _e_n_c_e_p_h_a_l_o_p_a_t_h_y ("mad cow" disease),

technologies, biotechnology, and _a_s_b_e_s_t_o_s_i_s. Dr. Andrew Maynard, chief science
advisor to the Woodrow Wilson Center‚Äôs Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies,
concludes that there is insufficient funding for human health and safety
research, and as a result there is currently limited understanding of the human
health and safety risks associated with nanotechnology._[_7_5_] As a result, some
academics have called for stricter application of the _p_r_e_c_a_u_t_i_o_n_a_r_y_ _p_r_i_n_c_i_p_l_e,

The Royal Society report_[_1_0_] identified a risk of nanoparticles or nanotubes
being released during disposal, destruction and recycling, and recommended that
‚Äúmanufacturers of products that fall under extended producer responsibility
regimes such as end-of-life regulations publish procedures outlining how these
materials will be managed to minimize possible human and environmental
exposure‚Äù (p. xiii). Reflecting the challenges for ensuring responsible life
