A nneewwssppaappeerr is a periodical publication containing news regarding current
events, informative articles, diverse features, editorials, and advertising. It
usually is printed on relatively inexpensive, low-grade paper such as
_n_e_w_s_p_r_i_n_t. By 2007, there were 6,580 daily newspapers in the world selling 395
million copies a day. The _l_a_t_e_ _2_0_0_0_s_-_e_a_r_l_y_ _2_0_1_0_s_ _g_l_o_b_a_l_ _r_e_c_e_s_s_i_o_n, combined
with the rapid growth of web-based alternatives, caused a serious decline in
advertising and circulation, as many papers closed or sharply retrenched
operations._[_1_]
General-interest newspapers typically publish stories on local and national
political events and personalities, crime, business, entertainment, society and
sports. Most traditional papers also feature an editorial page containing
editorials written by an editor and _c_o_l_u_m_n_s that express the personal opinions
of writers. The newspaper is typically funded by paid _s_u_b_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n_s and
advertising.
A wide variety of material has been published in newspapers, including
editorial opinions, criticism, persuasion and _o_p_-_e_d_s; obituaries; entertainment
features such as _c_r_o_s_s_w_o_r_d_s, _s_u_d_o_k_u and _h_o_r_o_s_c_o_p_e_s; weather news and _f_o_r_e_c_a_s_t_s;
_a_d_v_i_c_e, _f_o_o_d and other columns; reviews of radio, movies, television, plays and
restaurants; _c_l_a_s_s_i_f_i_e_d_ _a_d_s; _d_i_s_p_l_a_y_ _a_d_s, radio and television listings,
inserts from local merchants, _e_d_i_t_o_r_i_a_l_ _c_a_r_t_o_o_n_s, _g_a_g_ _c_a_r_t_o_o_n_s and _c_o_m_i_c
_s_t_r_i_p_s.

A newspaper typically meets four criteria:_[_2_]_[_3_]
    * Publicity: Its contents are reasonably accessible to the public.
    * _P_e_r_i_o_d_i_c_i_t_y: It is published at regular intervals.
    * Currency: Its information is as up to date as its publication schedule
      allows.
    * Universality: It covers a range of topics.

In _A_n_c_i_e_n_t_ _R_o_m_e, _A_c_t_a_ _D_i_u_r_n_a, or government announcement bulletins, were
produced. They were carved in metal or stone and posted in public places.
In China, early government-produced news sheets, called _t_i_p_a_o, circulated among
court officials during the late _H_a_n_ _d_y_n_a_s_t_y (second and third centuries AD).
Between 713 and 734, the _K_a_i_y_u_a_n_ _Z_a_ _B_a_o ("Bulletin of the Court") of the
Chinese _T_a_n_g_ _D_y_n_a_s_t_y published government news; it was handwritten on silk and
read by government officials. In 1582, there was the first reference to
privately published newssheets in Beijing, during the late _M_i_n_g_ _D_y_n_a_s_t_y._[_4_]
In _E_a_r_l_y_ _m_o_d_e_r_n_ _E_u_r_o_p_e the increased cross-border interaction created a rising
need for information which was met by concise handwritten newssheets, called
avvisi. In 1556, the government of _V_e_n_i_c_e first published the monthly _N_o_t_i_z_i_e
_s_c_r_i_t_t_e, which cost one gazetta, a small coin._[_5_] These _a_v_v_i_s_i were handwritten
newsletters and used to convey political, military, and economic news quickly
and efficiently to Italian cities (1500â€“1700) â€” sharing some
characteristics of newspapers though usually not considered true newspapers._[_6_]
However, none of these publications fully met the classical criteria for proper
newspapers, as they were typically not intended for the general public and
restricted to a certain range of topics.

colonies. Soon after, weekly papers began publishing in New York and
Philadelphia. These early newspapers followed the British format and were
usually four pages long. They mostly carried news from Britain and content
depended on the editor's interests. In 1783, the _P_e_n_n_s_y_l_v_a_n_i_a_ _E_v_e_n_i_n_g_ _P_o_s_t

"Canada's first newspaper." However, its official descendant, the Royal

than a proper newspaper;

oldest continuously published newspaper in North America as the Quebec
Chronicle-Telegraph. It is currently published as an English-language weekly
from its offices at 1040 BelvÃ©dÃ¨re, suite 218, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada.
The first newspaper in South America was Diario de Pernambuco, established in
1825.

By the early 19th century, many cities in Europe, as well as North and South
America, published newspaper-type publications though not all of them developed
in the same way; content was vastly shaped by regional and cultural
preferences._[_1_6_] Advances in printing technology related to the _I_n_d_u_s_t_r_i_a_l
_R_e_v_o_l_u_t_i_o_n enabled newspapers to become an even more widely circulated means of
communication. In 1814, _T_h_e_ _T_i_m_e_s (London) acquired a printing press capable of
making 1,100 impressions per minute._[_1_7_]
Soon, it was adapted to print on both sides of a page at once. This innovation
made newspapers cheaper and thus available to a larger part of the population.
In 1830, the first penny press newspaper came to the market: Lynde M. Walter's
Boston _T_r_a_n_s_c_r_i_p_t._[_1_8_] Penny press papers cost about one sixth the price of

While most newspapers are aimed at a broad spectrum of readers, usually
geographically defined, some focus on groups of readers defined more by their
interests than their location: for example, there are daily and weekly business
newspapers and sports newspapers. More specialist still are some weekly
newspapers, usually free and distributed within limited areas; these may serve
communities as specific as certain immigrant populations, or the local gay
community.

Typically, the majority of these newspapersâ€™ staff members work Monday to
Friday, so the Sunday and Monday editions largely depend on content done in
advance or content that is syndicated. Most daily newspapers are published in
the morning. Afternoon or evening papers, once common but now scarce, are aimed
more at commuters and office workers.

In the UK, unlike most other countries, "daily" newspapers do not publish on
Sundays. In the past there were independent Sunday newspapers; nowadays the
same publisher often produces a _S_u_n_d_a_y_ _n_e_w_s_p_a_p_e_r, distinct in many ways from
the daily, usually with a related name; e.g. _T_h_e_ _T_i_m_e_s and _T_h_e_ _S_u_n_d_a_y_ _T_i_m_e_s are
distinct newspapers owned by the same company, and an article published in the
latter would never be credited to The Times. Similarly, the left-wing Guardian
publishes six days a week but also owns the formerly independent Sunday
Observer.

always had that focus, while others are repackaged national newspapers or
"international editions" of national or large metropolitan newspapers. In some
cases articles that might not interest the wider range of readers are omitted
from international editions; in others, of interest to _e_x_p_a_t_r_i_a_t_e_s, significant
national news is retained.
As English became the international language of business and technology, many
newspapers formerly published only in non-English languages have also developed
English-language editions. In places as varied as _J_e_r_u_s_a_l_e_m and _M_u_m_b_a_i,
newspapers are printed for a local and international English-speaking public,
and for tourists. The advent of the Internet has also allowed non-English-
language newspapers to put out a scaled-down English version to give their
newspaper a global outreach.
Similarly, in many countries with a large foreign-language-speaking population
or many tourists, newspapers in languages other than the national language are
both published locally and imported. For example, newspapers and magazines from
many countries, and _l_o_c_a_l_l_y_ _p_u_b_l_i_s_h_e_d_ _n_e_w_s_p_a_p_e_r_s_ _i_n_ _m_a_n_y_ _l_a_n_g_u_a_g_e_s, are readily

General newspapers cover all topics, with different emphasis. While at least
mentioning all topics, some might have good coverage of international events of
importance; others might concentrate more on national or local entertainment or
sports. Specialised newspapers might concentrate more specifically on, for
example, financial matters. There are publications covering exclusively sports,
or certain sports, horse-racing, theatre, and so on, although they may no
longer be called newspapers.

A new trend in newspaper publishing is the introduction of _p_e_r_s_o_n_a_l_i_z_a_t_i_o_n
through _o_n_-_d_e_m_a_n_d_ _p_r_i_n_t_i_n_g technologies. Customized newspapers allow the reader
to create their individual newspaper through the selection of individual pages
from multiple publications. This "Best of" approach allows to revive the print-
based model and opens up a new distribution channel to increase coverage
beneath the usual boundaries of distribution. Customized newspapers online have
been offered by MyYahoo, I-Google, CRAYON, ICurrent.com, Kibboko.com,
Twitter.times and many others.

In the United States, the overall manager or chief executive of the newspaper
is the publisher._[_2_4_] In small newspapers, the owner of the publication (or the
largest shareholder in the corporation that owns the publication) is usually
the publisher. Although he or she rarely or perhaps never writes stories, the
publisher is legally responsible for the contents of the entire newspaper and
also runs the business, including hiring editors, reporters, and other staff
members. This title is less common outside the U.S. The equivalent position in
the film industry and television news shows is the executive producer.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n

Most newspapers have four main departments devoted to publishing the newspaper
itselfâ€”editorial, production/printing, circulation, and advertising, although
they are frequently referred to by a variety of other namesâ€”as well as the
non-newspaper-specific departments also found in other businesses of comparable
size, such as accounting, marketing, human resources, and IT.
Throughout the English-speaking world, the person who selects the content for
the newspaper is usually referred to as the editor. Variations on this title
such as editor-in-chief, executive editor, and so on are common. For small
newspapers, a single editor may be responsible for all content areas. At large
newspapers, the most senior editor is in overall charge of the publication,
while less senior editors may each focus on one subject area, such as local
news or sports. These divisions are called _n_e_w_s_ _b_u_r_e_a_u_s or "desks", and each is
supervised by a designated editor. Most newspaper editors _c_o_p_y_ _e_d_i_t the stories
for their part of the newspaper, but they may share their workload with
_p_r_o_o_f_r_e_a_d_e_r_s and _f_a_c_t_ _c_h_e_c_k_e_r_s.

_R_e_p_o_r_t_e_r_s are journalists who primarily report facts that they have gathered
and those who write longer, less news-oriented articles may be called feature
writers. Photographers and _g_r_a_p_h_i_c_ _a_r_t_i_s_t_s provide images and illustrations to
support articles. Journalists often specialize in a subject area, called a
_b_e_a_t, such as sports, religion, or science. Columnists are journalists who
write regular articles recounting their personal opinions and experiences.
_P_r_i_n_t_e_r_s and press operators physically print the newspaper. Printing is
outsourced by many newspapers, partly because of the cost of an _o_f_f_s_e_t_ _w_e_b
_p_r_e_s_s (the most common kind of press used to print newspapers) and also because
a small newspaper's _p_r_i_n_t_ _r_u_n might require less than an hour of operation,
meaning that if the newspaper had its own press it would sit idle most of the
time. If the newspaper offers information online, _w_e_b_m_a_s_t_e_r_s and _w_e_b_ _d_e_s_i_g_n_e_r_s

Newspapers often refine distribution of ads and news through zoning and
editioning. Zoning occurs when advertising and editorial content change to
reflect the location to which the product is delivered. The editorial content
often may change merely to reflect changes in advertising â€” the quantity and
layout of which affects the space available for editorial â€” or may contain
region-specific news. In rare instances, the advertising may not change from
one zone to another, but there will be different region-specific editorial
content. As the content can vary widely, zoned editions are often produced in
parallel.
Editioning occurs in the main sections as news is updated throughout the night.
The advertising is usually the same in each edition (with the exception of
zoned regionals, in which it is often the â€˜Bâ€™ section of local news that
undergoes advertising changes). As each edition represents the latest news
available for the next press run, these editions are produced linearly, with
one completed edition being copied and updated for the next edition. The
previous edition is always copied to maintain a Newspaper of Record and to fall
back on if a quick correction is needed for the press. For example, both _T_h_e
_N_e_w_ _Y_o_r_k_ _T_i_m_e_s and _T_h_e_ _W_a_l_l_ _S_t_r_e_e_t_ _J_o_u_r_n_a_l offer a regional edition, printed
through a local contractor, and featuring locale specific content. The
Journal's global advertising _r_a_t_e_ _c_a_r_d provides a good example of editioning.

have revolutionized the newspaper production process. These technologies have
enabled newspapers to publish color photographs and graphics, as well as
innovative _l_a_y_o_u_t_s and better design.
To help their titles stand out on newsstands, some newspapers are printed on
coloured newsprint. For example, the _F_i_n_a_n_c_i_a_l_ _T_i_m_e_s is printed on a
distinctive salmon pink paper, and _S_h_e_f_f_i_e_l_d's weekly sports publication
derives its name, the _G_r_e_e_n_ _â_€_™_U_n, from the traditional colour of its paper.
The Italian sports newspaper _L_a_ _G_a_z_z_e_t_t_a_ _d_e_l_l_o_ _S_p_o_r_t is also printed on pink
paper while _L_'_Ã_‰_q_u_i_p_e (formerly Lâ€™Auto) is printed on yellow paper. Both the
latter promoted major cycling races and their newsprint colours were reflected
in the colours of the jerseys used to denote the race leader; for example the
leader in the _G_i_r_o_ _d_'_I_t_a_l_i_a wears a pink jersey.

The number of copies distributed, either on an average day or on particular
days (typically Sunday), is called the newspaper's circulation and is one of
the principal factors used to set advertising rates. Circulation is not
necessarily the same as copies sold, since some copies or newspapers are
distributed without cost. Readership figures may be higher than circulation
figures because many copies are read by more than one person, although this is
offset by the number of copies distributed but not read (especially for those
distributed free). In the United States, the _A_u_d_i_t_ _B_u_r_e_a_u_ _o_f_ _C_i_r_c_u_l_a_t_i_o_n_[_2_6_]

_F_a_k_t_y boasted the circulation of 33,500,000 in 1991.
According to United Nations data from 1995 Japan has three daily papers â€”the
_Y_o_m_i_u_r_i_ _S_h_i_m_b_u_n, _A_s_a_h_i_ _S_h_i_m_b_u_n, and _M_a_i_n_i_c_h_i_ _S_h_i_m_b_u_n â€” with circulations well
above 5.5 million. Germany's _B_i_l_d, with a circulation of 3.8 million, was the
only other paper in that category.
In the United Kingdom, _T_h_e_ _S_u_n is the top seller, with around 3.24 million
copies distributed daily.
In the U.S., The Wall Street Journal has a daily circulation of approximately
2.02 million, making it the most widely distributed paper in the country._[_2_7_]
While paid readership of print newspapers has been steadily declining in the
developed _O_E_C_D nations, it has been rising in the chief developing nations

Buying a newspaper
A common measure of a newspaper's health is market penetration, expressed as a
percentage of households that receive a copy of the newspaper against the total
number of households in the paper's market area. In the 1920s, on a national
basis in the U.S., daily newspapers achieved market penetration of 123 percent
(meaning the average U.S. household received 1.23 newspapers). As other media
began to compete with newspapers, and as printing became easier and less
expensive giving rise to a greater diversity of publications, market
penetration began to decline. It wasnâ€™t until the early 1970s, however, that
market penetration dipped below 100 percent. By 2000, it was 53 percent and
still falling._[_3_1_]
Many paid-for newspapers offer a variety of subscription plans. For example,
someone might want only a Sunday paper, or perhaps only Sunday and Saturday, or
maybe only a _w_o_r_k_w_e_e_k subscription, or perhaps a daily subscription.
Most newspapers provide some or all of their content on the Internet, either at
no cost or for a fee. In some cases, free access is available only for a matter
of days or weeks, or for a certain number of viewed articles, after which
readers must register and provide personal data. In other cases, free archives
are provided.

A newspaper typically generates 70â€“80% of its revenue from advertising, and
the remainder from sales and subscriptions._[_3_2_] The portion of the newspaper
that is not advertising is called editorial content, editorial matter, or
simply editorial, although the last term is also used to refer specifically to
those articles in which the newspaper and its guest writers express their
opinions. (This distinction, however, developed over time â€“ early publishers
like Girardin (France) and Zang (Austria) did not always distinguish paid items
from editorial content.)
The _b_u_s_i_n_e_s_s_ _m_o_d_e_l of having advertising subsidize the cost of printing and
distributing newspapers (and, it is always hoped, the making of a profit)
rather than having subscribers cover the full cost was first done, it seems, in
1833 by _T_h_e_ _S_u_n, a daily paper that was published in New York City. Rather than
charging 6 cents per copy, the price of a typical New York daily at the time,
they charged 1-cent, and depended on advertising to make up the difference._[_3_3_]

Newspapers in countries with easy access to the _w_e_b have been hurt by the
decline of many traditional advertisers. Department stores and supermarkets
could be relied upon in the past to buy pages of newspaper advertisements, but
due to industry consolidation are much less likely to do so now._[_3_5_]
Additionally, newspapers are seeing traditional advertisers shift to new media
platforms. The classified category is shifting to sites including _C_r_a_i_g_s_l_i_s_t,
employment websites, and auto sites. National advertisers are shifting to many
types of digital content including websites, rich media platforms, and mobile.
In recent years, the _a_d_v_e_r_t_o_r_i_a_l emerged. Advertorials are most commonly
recognized as an _o_p_p_o_s_i_t_e_-_e_d_i_t_o_r_i_a_l which third-parties pay a fee to have
included in the paper. _A_d_v_e_r_t_o_r_i_a_l_s commonly advertise new products or
techniques, such as a new design for golf equipment, a new form of laser
surgery, or weight-loss drugs. The tone is usually closer to that of a _p_r_e_s_s
_r_e_l_e_a_s_e than of an objective _n_e_w_s_ _s_t_o_r_y.

The editorial staff of newspaper "Severnyi Kray" in _Y_a_r_o_s_l_a_v_l, Russia in 1900
Since newspapers began as a journal (record of current events), the profession
involved in the making of newspapers began to be called journalism.
In the _y_e_l_l_o_w_ _j_o_u_r_n_a_l_i_s_m era of the 19th century, many newspapers in the United
States relied on sensational stories that were meant to anger or excite the
public, rather than to inform. The restrained style of reporting that relies on
fact checking and accuracy regained popularity around World War II.
Criticism of journalism is varied and sometimes vehement. Credibility is
questioned because of anonymous sources; errors in facts, spelling, and
grammar; real or perceived _b_i_a_s; and scandals involving _p_l_a_g_i_a_r_i_s_m and
fabrication.
In the past, newspapers have often been owned by so-called _p_r_e_s_s_ _b_a_r_o_n_s, and
were used for gaining a political voice. After 1920 most major newspapers
became parts of chains run by large media corporations such as _G_a_n_n_e_t_t, _T_h_e
_M_c_C_l_a_t_c_h_y_ _C_o_m_p_a_n_y, _H_e_a_r_s_t_ _C_o_r_p_o_r_a_t_i_o_n, _C_o_x_ _E_n_t_e_r_p_r_i_s_e_s, _L_a_n_d_m_a_r_k_ _M_e_d_i_a
_E_n_t_e_r_p_r_i_s_e_s_ _L_L_C, _M_o_r_r_i_s_ _C_o_m_m_u_n_i_c_a_t_i_o_n_s, _T_h_e_ _T_r_i_b_u_n_e_ _C_o_m_p_a_n_y, _H_o_l_l_i_n_g_e_r
_I_n_t_e_r_n_a_t_i_o_n_a_l, _N_e_w_s_ _C_o_r_p_o_r_a_t_i_o_n, _S_w_i_f_t_ _C_o_m_m_u_n_i_c_a_t_i_o_n_s, etc.
Newspapers have, in the modern world, played an important role in the exercise
of freedom of expression. Whistle-blowers, and those who "leak" stories of
corruption in political circles often choose to inform newspapers before other
mediums of communication, relying on the perceived willingness of newspaper
editors to expose the secrets and lies of those who would rather cover them.
However, there have been many circumstances of the political autonomy of
newspapers being curtailed. Recent research has examined the effects of a
newspaper's closing on the reelection of incumbents, voter turnout, and
campaign spending._[_3_6_]
Opinions of other writers and readers are expressed in the _o_p_-_e_d ("opposite the
editorial page") and _l_e_t_t_e_r_s_ _t_o_ _t_h_e_ _e_d_i_t_o_r_s sections of the paper.
Some ways newspapers have tried to improve their credibility are: appointing
_o_m_b_u_d_s_m_e_n, developing ethics policies and training, using more stringent
corrections policies, communicating their processes and rationale with readers,
and asking sources to review articles after publication.

Newspaper press in _L_i_m_o_g_e_s, France
By the late 1990s, the availability of news via _2_4_-_h_o_u_r_ _t_e_l_e_v_i_s_i_o_n_ _c_h_a_n_n_e_l_s and
then the _I_n_t_e_r_n_e_t posed an ongoing challenge to the _b_u_s_i_n_e_s_s_ _m_o_d_e_l of most
newspapers in developed countries. Paid _c_i_r_c_u_l_a_t_i_o_n has declined, while
advertising revenue â€” which makes up the bulk of most newspapersâ€™
income â€” has been shifting from print to the new media, resulting in a
general decline in profits. Many newspapers around the world launched online
editions in an attempt to follow or stay ahead of their audience.
However, in the rest of the world, cheaper printing and distribution, increased
literacy, the growing middle class and other factors have more than compensated
for the emergence of electronic media and newspapers continue to grow._[_3_7_]
On 10 April 1995, _T_h_e_ _A_m_e_r_i_c_a_n_ _R_e_p_o_r_t_e_r_[_3_8_] became the first daily newspaper,
with its own paid reporters around the world and all-original content, to start
on the Internet. The editor-in-chief and founder is _J_o_e_ _S_h_e_a. The site is owned
by 400 journalists._[_3_9_]
The future of newspapers in countries with easy internet access has been widely
debated as the industry has faced down soaring newsprint prices, slumping ad
sales, the loss of much classified advertising and precipitous drops in
circulation. In recent years the number of newspapers slated for closure,
bankruptcy or severe cutbacks has risenâ€”especially in the United States,
where the industry has shed a fifth of its journalists since 2001._[_4_0_] Revenue
has plunged while competition from internet media has squeezed older print
publishers._[_4_0_]
The debate has become more urgent lately, as the 2008-2009 recession shaved
profits,_[_4_1_] and as once-explosive growth in newspaper web revenues has leveled
off, forestalling what the industry hoped would become an important source of
revenue._[_4_2_] At issue is whether the newspaper industry faces a _c_y_c_l_i_c_a_l
trough, or whether new technology has rendered obsolete newspapers in their
traditional format.
