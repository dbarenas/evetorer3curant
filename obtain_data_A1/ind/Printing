PPrriinnttiinngg is a process for reproducing text and images, typically with ink on
_p_a_p_e_r using a printing press. It is often carried out as a large-scale
industrial process, and is an essential part of publishing and transaction
printing.
The earliest form of printing was _w_o_o_d_b_l_o_c_k_ _p_r_i_n_t_i_n_g, with existing examples
from China dating to before 220 A.D._[_1_] and _E_g_y_p_t to the fourth century. Later
developments in printing include the _m_o_v_a_b_l_e_ _t_y_p_e, first developed by _B_i_ _S_h_e_n_g
in China,_[_2_] and the _p_r_i_n_t_i_n_g_ _p_r_e_s_s, a more efficient printing process for
western languages with their more limited _a_l_p_h_a_b_e_t_s, developed by _J_o_h_a_n_n_e_s
_G_u_t_e_n_b_e_r_g in the fifteenth century._[_3_]

_W_o_o_d_b_l_o_c_k_ _p_r_i_n_t_i_n_g is a technique for printing text, images or patterns that
was used widely throughout East Asia. It originated in China in antiquity as a
method of printing on _t_e_x_t_i_l_e_s and later on paper. As a method of printing on
cloth, the earliest surviving examples from China date to before 220 A.D. and
examples from _R_o_m_a_n_ _E_g_y_p_t date to the fourth century.

The earliest surviving woodblock printed fragments are from China and are of
silk printed with flowers in three colours from the Han Dynasty (before 220
A.D.), and the earliest example of woodblock printing on paper appeared in the
mid-seventh century in China.
By the ninth century, printing on paper had taken off, and the first extant
complete printed book containing its date is the _D_i_a_m_o_n_d_ _S_u_t_r_a (_B_r_i_t_i_s_h
_L_i_b_r_a_r_y) of 868._[_4_] By the tenth century, 400,000 copies of some sutras and
pictures were printed and the Confucian classics were in print. A skilled
printer could print up to 2,000 double-page sheets per day._[_5_]
Printing spread early to _K_o_r_e_a and Japan, who also used Chinese _l_o_g_o_g_r_a_m_s, but
the techniques also were used in _T_u_r_p_a_n and _V_i_e_t_n_a_m using a number of other
scripts. Unlike the diffusion of paper, however, printing techniques never
spread to the Islamic world._[_6_]

Woodblock printing on cloth appeared in _R_o_m_a_n_ _E_g_y_p_t by the fourth century.
Block printing, called tarsh in _A_r_a_b_i_c was developed in _A_r_a_b_i_c_ _E_g_y_p_t during the
ninth-tenth centuries, mostly for prayers and _a_m_u_l_e_t_s. There is some evidence
to suggest that these print blocks were made from non-wood materials, possibly
_t_i_n, lead, or clay. The techniques employed are uncertain, however, and they
appear to have had very little influence outside of the _M_u_s_l_i_m_ _w_o_r_l_d. Though
Europe adopted woodblock printing from the Muslim world, initially for fabric,
the technique of metal block printing remained unknown in Europe. Block
printing later went out of use in Islamic Central Asia after movable type
printing was introduced from China._[_7_]

Block printing first came to Europe as a method for printing on cloth, where it
was common by 1300. Images printed on cloth for religious purposes could be
quite large and elaborate, and when paper became relatively easily available,
around 1400, the medium transferred very quickly to small _w_o_o_d_c_u_t religious
images and _p_l_a_y_i_n_g_ _c_a_r_d_s printed on paper. These _p_r_i_n_t_s were produced in very
large numbers from about 1425 onward.
Around the mid-fifteenth-century, block-books, woodcut books with both text and
images, usually carved in the same block, emerged as a cheaper alternative to
manuscripts and books printed with _m_o_v_a_b_l_e_ _t_y_p_e. These were all short heavily
illustrated works, the bestsellers of the day, repeated in many different
block-book versions: the _A_r_s_ _m_o_r_i_e_n_d_i and the _B_i_b_l_i_a_ _p_a_u_p_e_r_u_m were the most
common. There is still some controversy among scholars as to whether their
introduction preceded or, the majority view, followed the introduction of
_m_o_v_a_b_l_e_ _t_y_p_e, with the range of estimated dates being between about 1440 and
1460._[_8_]

MMoovvaabbllee ttyyppee is the system of printing and _t_y_p_o_g_r_a_p_h_y using movable pieces of
metal type, made by casting from _m_a_t_r_i_c_e_s struck by _l_e_t_t_e_r_p_u_n_c_h_e_s. _M_o_v_a_b_l_e_ _t_y_p_e
allowed for much more flexible processes than hand copying or block printing.
Around 1040, the first known movable type system was created in China by _B_i
_S_h_e_n_g out of _p_o_r_c_e_l_a_i_n._[_2_] Sheng used clay type, which broke easily, but _W_a_n_g
_Z_h_e_n later carved a more durable type from wood by 1298 C.E., and developed a
complex system of revolving tables and number-association with written Chinese
characters that made typesetting and printing more efficient. Still, the main
method in use there remained woodblock printing (xylography), which "proved to
be cheaper and more efficient for printing Chinese, with its thousands of
characters"._[_9_]
Copper movable type printing originated in China at the beginning of twelfth
century. It was used in large scale printing of paper money issued by the
Northern Song dynasty.
Around 1230, Koreans invented a metal type movable printing using bronze. The
_J_i_k_j_i, published in 1377, is the earliest known metal printed book. Types-
casting was used, adapted from the method of casting coins. The character was
cut in beech wood, which was then pressed into a soft clay to form a mould and
bronze poured into the mould and the type was finally polished._[_1_0_]
Around 1450, _J_o_h_a_n_n_e_s_ _G_u_t_e_n_b_e_r_g introduced what is regarded as the first modern
movable type system in Europe (see _p_r_i_n_t_i_n_g_ _p_r_e_s_s), along with innovations in
casting the type based on a matrix and _h_a_n_d_ _m_o_u_l_d. Gutenberg was the first to
create his type pieces from an alloy of lead, _t_i_n, and _a_n_t_i_m_o_n_y â€“ the same
components still used today._[_1_1_]

Johannes Gutenberg's work on his _p_r_i_n_t_i_n_g_ _p_r_e_s_s began in approximately 1436
when he partnered with Andreas Dritzehen â€“ a man he had previously instructed
in gem-cutting â€“ and Andreas Heilmann, the owner of a paper mill._[_1_2_] It was
not until a 1439 _l_a_w_s_u_i_t against Gutenberg that an official record exists;
witness testimony discussed type, an inventory of metals (including lead) and
his type mold._[_1_2_]
Compared to _w_o_o_d_b_l_o_c_k_ _p_r_i_n_t_i_n_g, movable type page setting and printing using a
press was faster and more durable. The metal type pieces were sturdier and the
lettering more uniform, leading to _t_y_p_o_g_r_a_p_h_y and _f_o_n_t_s. The high quality and
relatively low price of the _G_u_t_e_n_b_e_r_g_ _B_i_b_l_e (1455) established the superiority
of movable type for western languages, and _p_r_i_n_t_i_n_g_ _p_r_e_s_s_e_s rapidly spread
across Europe, leading up to the _R_e_n_a_i_s_s_a_n_c_e, and later _a_l_l_ _a_r_o_u_n_d_ _t_h_e_ _w_o_r_l_d.
Today, practically all movable type printing ultimately derives from
Gutenberg's innovations to movable type printing, which is often regarded as

OOffffsseett pprriinnttiinngg is a widely used printing technique where the inked image is
transferred (or "offset") from a plate to a rubber blanket, then to the
printing surface. When used in combination with the _l_i_t_h_o_g_r_a_p_h_i_c process, which
is based on the repulsion of oil and water, the offset technique employs a flat
(planographic) image carrier on which the image to be printed obtains _i_n_k from
ink rollers, while the non-printing area attracts a film of water, keeping the
non-printing areas ink-free.
Currently, most books and newspapers are printed using the technique of offset
lithography. Other common techniques include:
    * _f_l_e_x_o_g_r_a_p_h_y used for packaging, labels, newspapers
    * hot wax _d_y_e_ _t_r_a_n_s_f_e_r
    * _i_n_k_j_e_t used typically to print a small number of books or packaging and
      also, to print a variety of materials from high quality papers simulating
      offset printing, to floor tiles; Inkjet is also used to apply mailing
      addresses to direct mail pieces
    * _l_a_s_e_r_ _p_r_i_n_t_i_n_g mainly used in offices and for transactional printing
      (bills, bank documents). Laser printing is commonly used by direct mail
      companies to create variable data letters or coupons, for example
    * _p_a_d_ _p_r_i_n_t_i_n_g popular for its unique ability to print on complex three-

    * _r_e_l_i_e_f_ _p_r_i_n_t, (mainly used for _c_a_t_a_l_o_g_u_e_s)
    * _r_o_t_o_g_r_a_v_u_r_e mainly used for magazines and packaging

_G_r_a_v_u_r_e_ _p_r_i_n_t_i_n_g is an _i_n_t_a_g_l_i_o_ _p_r_i_n_t_i_n_g technique, where the image to be
printed is made up of small depressions in the surface of the printing plate.
The cells are filled with ink and the excess is scraped off the surface with a
doctor blade, then a rubber-covered roller presses paper onto the surface of
the plate and into contact with the ink in the cells. The printing plates are
usually made from copper and may be produced by digital engraving or _l_a_s_e_r
etching.
Gravure printing is used for long, high-quality print runs such as magazines,
mail-order catalogues, packaging, and printing onto fabric and wallpaper. It is
also used for printing postage stamps and decorative plastic laminates, such as
kitchen worktops.

_S_a_m_u_e_l_ _H_a_r_t_l_i_b, who was exiled in _B_r_i_t_a_i_n and enthusiastic about social and
cultural reforms, wrote in 1641 that "the art of printing will so spread
knowledge that the common people, knowing their own rights and liberties, will
not be governed by way of oppression"._[_1_6_] Both churchmen and governments were
concerned that print allowed readers, eventually including those from all
classes of society, to study religious texts and politically sensitive issues
by themselves, instead of having their thinking mediated by the religious and
political authorities.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]

In the Muslim world, printing, especially in Arabic or Turkish, was strongly
opposed throughout the _e_a_r_l_y_ _m_o_d_e_r_n_ _p_e_r_i_o_d, though sometimes, printing in
_H_e_b_r_e_w was permitted.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] Muslim countries have been regarded as
forming a consistent barrier to the passage of printing from China to the West.
According to an imperial ambassador to _I_s_t_a_n_b_u_l in the middle of the sixteenth
century, it was a sin for the _T_u_r_k_s to print religious books. In 1515, Sultan
_S_e_l_i_m_ _I issued a decree under which the practice of printing would be
punishable by death.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] At the end of the sixteenth century,
Sultan _M_u_r_a_d_ _I_I_I permitted the sale of non-religious printed books in _A_r_a_b_i_c
characters, yet the majority were imported from _I_t_a_l_y.
Jews were banned from German printing _g_u_i_l_d_s; as a result Hebrew printing
sprang up in _I_t_a_l_y, beginning in 1470 in Rome, then spreading to other cities
including Bari, Pisa, Livorno, and Mantua. Local rulers had the authority to
grant or revoke licenses to publish Hebrew books,_[_1_7_] and many of those printed
during this period carry the words 'con licenza de superiori' (indicating their
printing having been licensed by the censor) on their title pages.
It was thought that the introduction of the printing medium 'would strengthen
religion and enhance the power of monarchs.'_[_1_8_] The majority of books were of
a religious nature, with the church and crown regulating the content. The
consequences of printing 'wrong' material were extreme. Meyrowitz_[_1_8_] used the
example of _W_i_l_l_i_a_m_ _C_a_r_t_e_r who in 1584 printed a pro-Catholic pamphlet in
Protestant-dominated England. The consequence of his action was _h_a_n_g_i_n_g.
The widespread distribution of the Bible 'had a revolutionary impact, because
it decreased the power of the Catholic Church as the prime possessor and
interpretor of God's word.'_[_1_8_]

Print gave a broader range of readers access to knowledge and enabled later
generations to build directly on the intellectual achievements of earlier ones
without the changes arising within verbal traditions. Print, according to _A_c_t_o_n
in his lecture On the Study of History (1895), gave "assurance that the work of
the _R_e_n_a_i_s_s_a_n_c_e would last, that what was written would be accessible to all,
that such an occultation of knowledge and ideas as had depressed the _M_i_d_d_l_e
_A_g_e_s would never recur, that not an idea would be lost"._[_1_6_]
Bookprinting in the 15th century
Print was instrumental in changing the nature of reading within society.
_E_l_i_z_a_b_e_t_h_ _E_i_s_e_n_s_t_e_i_n identifies two long term effects of the invention of
printing. She claims that print created a sustained and uniform reference for
knowledge as well as allowing for comparison between incompatible views.
(Eisenstein in Briggs and Burke, 2002: p21)
_A_s_a_ _B_r_i_g_g_s and _P_e_t_e_r_ _B_u_r_k_e identify five kinds of reading that developed in
relation to the introduction of print:
   1. Critical reading: due to the fact that texts finally became accessible to
      the general population, critical reading emerged because people were
      given the option to form their own opinions on texts
   2. Dangerous Reading: reading was seen as a dangerous pursuit because it was
      considered rebellious and unsociable especially in the case of women,
      because reading could stir up dangerous emotions such as love and that if
      women could read, they could read love notes
   3. Creative reading: printing allowed people to read texts and interpret
      them creatively, often in very different ways than the author intended
   4. Extensive Reading: print allowed for a wide range of texts to become
      available, thus, previous methods of intensive reading of texts from
      start to finish, began to change and with texts being readily available,
      people began reading on particular topics or chapters, allowing for much
      more extensive reading on a wider range of topics
   5. Private reading: became linked to the rise of individualism because
      before print, reading was often a group event, where one person would
      read to a group of people and with print, literacy rose as did
      availability of texts, thus reading became a solitary pursuit
The invention of printing also changed the occupational structure of European
cities. _P_r_i_n_t_e_r_s emerged as a new group of artisans for whom literacy was
essential, although the much more labour-intensive occupation of the _s_c_r_i_b_e
naturally declined. Proof-correcting arose as a new occupation, while a rise in
the amount of _b_o_o_k_s_e_l_l_e_r_s and librarians naturally followed the explosion in
the numbers of books.

By 2005, _D_i_g_i_t_a_l_ _p_r_i_n_t_i_n_g accounts for approximately 9% of the 45 trillion

Printing at home, an office, or an engineering environment is subdivided into:
    * small format (up to ledger size paper sheets), as used in business
      offices and libraries
    * wide format (up to 3' or 914mm wide rolls of paper), as used in drafting
      and design establishments.
Some of the more common printing technologies are:
    * _b_l_u_e_p_r_i_n_t â€“ and related chemical technologies
    * _d_a_i_s_y_ _w_h_e_e_l â€“ where pre-formed characters are applied individually
    * _d_o_t_-_m_a_t_r_i_x â€“ which produces arbitrary patterns of dots with an array of
      printing studs
    * _l_i_n_e_ _p_r_i_n_t_i_n_g â€“ where formed characters are applied to the paper by
      lines
    * _h_e_a_t_ _t_r_a_n_s_f_e_r â€“ such as early fax machines or modern receipt printers
      that apply heat to special paper, which turns black to form the printed
      image
    * _i_n_k_j_e_t â€“ including bubble-jet, where ink is sprayed onto the paper to
      create the desired image
    * _e_l_e_c_t_r_o_p_h_o_t_o_g_r_a_p_h_y â€“ where _t_o_n_e_r is attracted to a charged image and
      then developed
    * _l_a_s_e_r â€“ a type of _x_e_r_o_g_r_a_p_h_y where the charged image is written pixel
      by pixel using a laser
    * _s_o_l_i_d_ _i_n_k printer â€“ where _c_u_b_e_s of ink are melted to make ink or liquid
      toner
Vendors typically stress the total cost to operate the equipment, involving
complex calculations that include all cost factors involved in the operation as
well as the capital equipment costs, amortization, etc. For the most part,
toner systems are more economical than inkjet in the long run, even though
inkjets are less expensive in the initial purchase price.
Professional _d_i_g_i_t_a_l_ _p_r_i_n_t_i_n_g (using _t_o_n_e_r) primarily uses an electrical charge
to transfer toner or liquid ink to the substrate onto which it is printed.
Digital print quality has steadily improved from early color and black and
white copiers to sophisticated colour digital presses such as the Xerox iGen3,
the Kodak Nexpress, the HP _I_n_d_i_g_o_ _D_i_g_i_t_a_l_ _P_r_e_s_s series, and the InfoPrint 5000.
The iGen3 and Nexpress use toner particles and the Indigo uses liquid ink. The
InfoPrint 5000 is a full-color, continuous forms inkjet drop-on-demand printing
system. All handle variable data, and rival offset in quality. Digital offset
presses are also called direct imaging presses, although these presses can
receive computer files and automatically turn them into print-ready plates,
they cannot insert variable data.
Small press and fanzines generally use _d_i_g_i_t_a_l_ _p_r_i_n_t_i_n_g. Prior to the
introduction of cheap photocopying the use of machines such as the _s_p_i_r_i_t
_d_u_p_l_i_c_a_t_o_r, _h_e_c_t_o_g_r_a_p_h, and _m_i_m_e_o_g_r_a_p_h was common.

_3_D_ _p_r_i_n_t_i_n_g is a form of manufacturing technology where objects are created
using three-dimensional files and _3_D_ _p_r_i_n_t_e_r_s. Objects are created by laying
down successive layers of material. As of 2012, some companies such as _S_c_u_l_p_t_e_o
or Shapeways are proposing online solutions for 3D printing.

_G_a_n_g_ _r_u_n_ _p_r_i_n_t_i_n_g is a method in which multiple printing projects are placed on
a common paper sheet in an effort to reduce printing costs and paper waste.
Gang runs are generally used with sheet-fed printing presses and CMYK process
color jobs, which require four separate plates that are loaded into the press.
Printers use the term "gang run" or "gang" to describe the practice of placing
many print projects on the same sheet or piggybacking a project on a vacant,
unused portion of a print sheet
