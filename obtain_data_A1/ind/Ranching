A rraanncchh is an area of _l_a_n_d_s_c_a_p_e, including various structures, given primarily
to the practice of rraanncchhiinngg, the practice of raising _g_r_a_z_i_n_g _l_i_v_e_s_t_o_c_k such as
_c_a_t_t_l_e or _s_h_e_e_p for meat or wool. The word most often applies to livestock-
raising operations in _M_e_x_i_c_o, the western _U_n_i_t_e_d_ _S_t_a_t_e_s and _C_a_n_a_d_a, though
there are ranches in other areas. People who own or operate a ranch are called
rraanncchheerrss, or ssttoocckkggrroowweerrss. Ranching is also a method used to raise less common
_l_i_v_e_s_t_o_c_k such as _e_l_k, _A_m_e_r_i_c_a_n_ _b_i_s_o_n or even _o_s_t_r_i_c_h, _e_m_u, and _a_l_p_a_c_a_s.
Ranches generally consist of large areas, but may be of nearly any size. In the
western United States, many ranches are a combination of privately owned land
supplemented by grazing leases on land under the control of the federal _B_u_r_e_a_u
_o_f_ _L_a_n_d_ _M_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t. If the ranch includes _a_r_a_b_l_e or irrigated land, the ranch
may also engage in a limited amount of _f_a_r_m_i_n_g, raising crops for feeding the
animals, such as _h_a_y and feed grains.
Ranches that cater exclusively to tourists are called _g_u_e_s_t_ _r_a_n_c_h_e_s or,
_c_o_l_l_o_q_u_i_a_l_l_y, "dude ranches." Most working ranches do not cater to guests,
though they may allow private _h_u_n_t_e_r_s or _o_u_t_f_i_t_t_e_r_s onto their property to hunt
native wildlife. However, in recent years, a few struggling smaller operations
have added some dude ranch features, such as horseback rides, cattle drives or
guided hunting, in an attempt to bring in additional income. Ranching is part
of the _i_c_o_n_o_g_r_a_p_h_y of the "Wild West" as seen in _W_e_s_t_e_r_n_ _m_o_v_i_e_s and _r_o_d_e_o_s.

The person who owns and manages the operation of a ranch is usually called a
rancher, but the terms cattleman, stockgrower, or stockman are also sometimes
used. If this individual in charge of overall management is an employee of the
actual owner, the term foreman or ranch foreman is used. A rancher who
primarily raises young stock sometimes is called a cow-calf operator or a cow-
calf man. This person is usually the owner, though in some cases, particularly
where there is absentee ownership, it is the ranch manager or ranch foreman.
The people who are employees of the rancher and involved in handling livestock
are called a number of terms, including cowhand, ranch hand, and _c_o_w_b_o_y. People
exclusively involved with handling horses are sometimes called _w_r_a_n_g_l_e_r_s.

Ranching and the _c_o_w_b_o_y tradition originated in _S_p_a_i_n, out of the necessity to
handle large herds of grazing animals on dry land from horseback. During the
_R_e_c_o_n_q_u_i_s_t_a, members of the _S_p_a_n_i_s_h_ _n_o_b_i_l_i_t_y and various _m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y_ _o_r_d_e_r_s
received large land grants that the _K_i_n_g_d_o_m_ _o_f_ _C_a_s_t_i_l_e had _c_o_n_q_u_e_r_e_d_ _f_r_o_m_ _t_h_e
_M_o_o_r_s. These landowners were to defend the lands put into their control and
could use them for earning revenue. In the process it was found that open-range
breeding of sheep and cattle (under the _M_e_s_t_a system) was the most suitable use
for vast tracts, particularly in the parts of Spain now known as _C_a_s_t_i_l_l_a_-_L_a

When the _C_o_n_q_u_i_s_t_a_d_o_r_s came to the _A_m_e_r_i_c_a_s in the 16th century, followed by
settlers, they brought their _c_a_t_t_l_e and cattle-raising techniques with them.
Huge land grants by the Spanish (and later Mexican) government, part of the
_h_a_c_i_e_n_d_a system, allowed large numbers of animals to roam freely over vast
areas. A number of different traditions developed, often related to the
original location in Spain from which a settlement originated. For example,
many of the traditions of the _J_a_l_i_s_c_o _c_h_a_r_r_o_s in central Mexico come from the
_S_a_l_a_m_a_n_c_a charros of Castile[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]. The _V_a_q_u_e_r_o tradition of
Northern Mexico was more organic, developed to adapt to the characteristics of
the region from Spanish sources by cultural interaction between the Spanish
elites and the native and mestizo peoples._[_1_]

As settlers from the _U_n_i_t_e_d_ _S_t_a_t_e_s moved west, they brought cattle breeds
developed on the east coast and in _E_u_r_o_p_e along with them, and adapted their
management to the drier lands of the west by borrowing key elements of the
Spanish _v_a_q_u_e_r_o culture.
However, there were cattle on the eastern seaboard. _D_e_e_p_ _H_o_l_l_o_w_ _R_a_n_c_h, 110

first ranch in the United States, having continuously operated since 1658._[_2_]
The ranch makes the somewhat debatable claim of having the oldest cattle
operation in what today is the United States, though cattle had been run in the
area since European settlers purchased land from the _I_n_d_i_a_n_ _p_e_o_p_l_e of the area
in 1643._[_3_] Although there were substantial numbers of cattle on Long Island,
as well as the need to herd them to and from common grazing lands on a seasonal
basis, the cattle handlers actually lived in houses built on the pasture
grounds, and cattle were ear-marked for identification, rather than being
branded._[_3_] The only actual "cattle drives" held on Long Island consisted of
one drive in 1776, when the Island's cattle were moved in a failed attempt to
prevent them from being captured by the British during the _A_m_e_r_i_c_a_n_ _R_e_v_o_l_u_t_i_o_n,
and three or four drives in the late 1930s, when area cattle were herded down
Montauk Highway to pasture ground near Deep Hollow Ranch ._[_3_]

The _p_r_a_i_r_i_e and _d_e_s_e_r_t lands of what today is _M_e_x_i_c_o and the western _U_n_i_t_e_d
_S_t_a_t_e_s were well-suited to "_o_p_e_n_ _r_a_n_g_e" grazing. For example, _A_m_e_r_i_c_a_n_ _b_i_s_o_n
had been a mainstay of the diet for the _N_a_t_i_v_e_ _A_m_e_r_i_c_a_n_s in the Great Plains
for centuries. Likewise, cattle and sheep, descended from animals brought over
from Europe, were simply turned loose in the spring after their young were born
and allowed to roam with little supervision and no fences, then rounded up in
the fall, with the mature animals driven to market and the breeding stock
brought close to the ranch headquarters for greater protection in the winter.
The use of _l_i_v_e_s_t_o_c_k_ _b_r_a_n_d_i_n_g allowed the cattle owned by different ranchers to
be identified and sorted. Beginning with the settlement of _T_e_x_a_s in the 1840s,
and expansion both north and west from that time, through the _C_i_v_i_l_ _W_a_r and
into the 1880s, ranching dominated western economic activity.
Along with ranchers came the need for agricultural crops to feed both humans
and livestock, and hence many _f_a_r_m_e_r_s also came west along with ranchers. Many
operations were "diversified," with both ranching and farming activities taking
place. With the _H_o_m_e_s_t_e_a_d_ _A_c_t of 1862, more settlers came west to set up _f_a_r_m_s.
This created some conflict, as increasing numbers of farmers needed to fence
off fields to prevent cattle and sheep from eating their crops. _B_a_r_b_e_d_ _w_i_r_e,
invented in 1874, gradually made inroads in fencing off privately owned land,
especially for homesteads. There was some reduction of land on the _G_r_e_a_t_ _P_l_a_i_n_s
open to grazing.

The severe winter of 1886-1887 brought an end to the open range. Waiting for a
Chinook, by _C_._M_._ _R_u_s_s_e_l_l.
The end of the open range was not brought about by a reduction in land due to
_c_r_o_p_ _f_a_r_m_i_n_g, but by _o_v_e_r_g_r_a_z_i_n_g. Cattle stocked on the open range created a

grazing too many animals on _p_u_b_l_i_c_ _l_a_n_d_s that "nobody" owned. However, being a
non-native species, the grazing patterns of ever-increasing numbers of cattle
slowly reduced the quality of the rangeland, in spite of the simultaneous
massive slaughter of _A_m_e_r_i_c_a_n_ _b_i_s_o_n that occurred. The winter of 1886-1887 was
one of the most severe on record, and livestock that were already stressed by
reduced grazing died by the thousands. Many large cattle operations went
bankrupt, and others suffered severe financial losses. Thus, after this time,
ranchers also began to fence off their land and negotiated individual grazing
leases with the American government so that they could keep better control of
the pasture land available to their own animals.

Ranching in _H_a_w_a_i_i developed independently of that in the continental United
States. In colonial times, Capt. _G_e_o_r_g_e_ _V_a_n_c_o_u_v_e_r gave several head of cattle
to the Hawaiian king, _P_a_i_`_e_a_ _K_a_m_e_h_a_m_e_h_a, monarch of the Hawaiian Kingdom, and
by the early 19th century, they had multiplied considerably, to the point that
they were wreaking havoc throughout the countryside. About 1812, John Parker, a
sailor who had jumped ship and settled in the islands, received permission from
Kamehameha to capture the wild cattle and develop a beef industry.
The Hawaiian style of ranching originally included capturing wild cattle by
driving them into pits dug in the forest floor. Once tamed somewhat by hunger
and thirst, they were hauled out up a steep ramp, and tied by their horns to
the horns of a tame, older steer (or _o_x) and taken to fenced-in areas. The
industry grew slowly under the reign of Kamehameha's son Liholiho (_K_a_m_e_h_a_m_e_h_a
_I_I). When Liholiho's son, Kauikeaouli (_K_a_m_e_h_a_m_e_h_a_ _I_I_I), visited _C_a_l_i_f_o_r_n_i_a,
then still a part of _M_e_x_i_c_o, he was impressed with the skill of the Mexican
_v_a_q_u_e_r_o_s. In 1832, he invited several to Hawaii to teach the Hawaiian people
how to work cattle.
The _H_a_w_a_i_i_a_n cowboy came to be called the paniolo, a _H_a_w_a_i_i_a_n_i_z_e_d pronunciation
of espaÃ±ol. Even today, the traditional Hawaiian saddle and many other tools
of the ranching trade have a distinctly Mexican look, and many Hawaiian
ranching families still carry the surnames of vaqueros who made Hawaii their
home.

In _A_r_g_e_n_t_i_n_a, ranches are known as _e_s_t_a_n_c_i_a_s, and in _B_r_a_z_i_l, they are called
_f_a_z_e_n_d_a_s. In much of _S_o_u_t_h_ _A_m_e_r_i_c_a, including _E_c_u_a_d_o_r and _C_o_l_o_m_b_i_a, the term
_h_a_c_i_e_n_d_a may be used. Ranchero or Rancho are also generic terms used throughout
_L_a_t_i_n_ _A_m_e_r_i_c_a.
In the colonial period, from the _p_a_m_p_a_s regions of _S_o_u_t_h_ _A_m_e_r_i_c_a all the way to
the _M_i_n_a_s_ _G_e_r_a_i_s state in Brazil, including the _s_e_m_i_-_a_r_i_d_ _p_a_m_p_a_s of _A_r_g_e_n_t_i_n_a
and the south of Brazil, were often well-suited to ranching, and a tradition
developed that largely paralleled that of Mexico and the United States. The
_g_a_u_c_h_o culture of _A_r_g_e_n_t_i_n_a, _B_r_a_z_i_l and _U_r_u_g_u_a_y are among the cattle ranching
traditions born during the period. However, in the 20th century, cattle raising
expanded into less-suitable areas of the _P_a_n_t_a_n_a_l. Particularly in _B_r_a_z_i_l, the
20th century marked the rapid growth of _d_e_f_o_r_e_s_t_a_t_i_o_n, as _r_a_i_n_ _f_o_r_e_s_t lands
were cleared by _s_l_a_s_h_ _a_n_d_ _b_u_r_n methods that allowed grass to grow for
livestock, but also led to the depletion of the land within only a few years.
Many of _i_n_d_i_g_e_n_o_u_s_ _p_e_o_p_l_e_s of the rain forest opposed this form of cattle
ranching and protested the forest being burnt down to set up grazing operations
and farms. This conflict is still a concern in the region today.

In Spain, where the origins of ranching can be traced, there are ganaderÃ­as
operating on _d_e_h_e_s_a-type land, where _f_i_g_h_t_i_n_g_ _b_u_l_l_s are raised. However, the
concept of a "ranch" is not seen to any significant degree in the rest of
western _E_u_r_o_p_e, where there is far less land area and sufficient rainfall
allows the raising of _c_a_t_t_l_e on much smaller farms.

In _A_u_s_t_r_a_l_i_a, the equivalent agricultural lands are known as '_s_t_a_t_i_o_n_s' in the
context of what stock they carry â usually referred to as _c_a_t_t_l_e_ _s_t_a_t_i_o_n_s or
_s_h_e_e_p_ _s_t_a_t_i_o_n_s. _N_e_w_ _Z_e_a_l_a_n_d_e_r_s use the term runs and _s_t_a_t_i_o_n_s.
The largest cattle stations in the world are located in Australia's dry
_r_a_n_g_e_l_a_n_d in the _o_u_t_b_a_c_k. Owners of these stations are known as '_g_r_a_z_i_e_r',
especially if they reside on the property. Employees are known as _s_t_o_c_k_m_e_n,
_j_a_c_k_a_r_o_o_s and ringers rather than _c_o_w_b_o_y_s. A number of Australian cattle
stations are larger than 10,000 kmÂ², with the greatest being _A_n_n_a_ _C_r_e_e_k
_s_t_a_t_i_o_n which measures 23,677 kmÂ² in area (approximately eight times the
largest US Ranch). Anna Creek is owned by _S_ _K_i_d_m_a_n_ _&_ _C_o.
