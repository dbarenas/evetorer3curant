RReettaaiill is the sale of goods and services from individuals or businesses to the
_e_n_d_-_u_s_e_r. Retailers are part of an integrated system called the supply chain. A
retailer purchases goods or _p_r_o_d_u_c_t_s in large quantities from _m_a_n_u_f_a_c_t_u_r_e_r_s
directly or through a wholesale, and then sells smaller quantities to the
_c_o_n_s_u_m_e_r for a profit. Retailing can be done in either fixed locations like
stores or markets, _d_o_o_r_-_t_o_-_d_o_o_r or by _d_e_l_i_v_e_r_y. Retailing includes subordinated
services, such as delivery. The term "retailer" is also applied where a service
provider services the needs of a large number of individuals, such as for the
public. Shops may be on residential streets, streets with few or no houses or
in a _s_h_o_p_p_i_n_g_ _m_a_l_l. Shopping streets may be for _p_e_d_e_s_t_r_i_a_n_s only. Sometimes a
shopping street has a partial or full _r_o_o_f to protect customers from
_p_r_e_c_i_p_i_t_a_t_i_o_n. Online retailing, a type of _e_l_e_c_t_r_o_n_i_c_ _c_o_m_m_e_r_c_e used for
business-to-consumer (B2C) transactions and _m_a_i_l_ _o_r_d_e_r, are forms of non-shop
retailing.
_S_h_o_p_p_i_n_g generally refers to the act of _b_u_y_i_n_g products. Sometimes this is done
to obtain necessities such as food and clothing; sometimes it is done as a
_r_e_c_r_e_a_t_i_o_n_a_l activity. Recreational shopping often involves window shopping
(just looking, not buying) and browsing and does not always result in a
purchase.

Retail comes from the Old French word tailler, which means "to cut off, clip,
pare, divide" in terms of tailoring (1365). It was first recorded as a noun
with the meaning of a "sale in small quantities" in 1433 (from the Middle
French retail, "piece cut off, shred, scrap, paring")._[_1_] Like in French, the
word retail in both Dutch and German also refers to the sale of small
quantities of items.

A _m_a_r_k_e_t_p_l_a_c_e is a location where goods and services are exchanged. The
traditional _m_a_r_k_e_t_ _s_q_u_a_r_e is a _c_i_t_y_ _s_q_u_a_r_e where traders set up stalls and
buyers browse the stores. This kind of market is very old, and countless such
markets are still in operation around the whole world.
In some parts of the world, the retail business is still dominated by small
family-run stores, but this market is increasingly being taken over by large
_r_e_t_a_i_l_ _c_h_a_i_n_s.
Retail is usually classified by type of products as follows:
    * Food products
    * Hard goods or durable goods ("hardline retailers") - appliances,
      electronics, furniture, sporting goods, etc. Goods that do not quickly
      wear out and provide utility over time.
    * Soft goods or consumables - clothing, apparel, and other fabrics. Goods
      that are consumed after one use or have a limited period (typically under
      three years) in which you may use them.
There are the following types of retailers by marketing strategy:
    * _D_e_p_a_r_t_m_e_n_t_ _s_t_o_r_e_s - very large stores offering a huge assortment of
      "soft" and "hard goods; often bear a resemblance to a collection of
      specialty stores. A retailer of such store carries variety of categories
      and has broad assortment at average price. They offer considerable
      customer service.
    * _D_i_s_c_o_u_n_t_ _s_t_o_r_e_s - tend to offer a wide array of products and services,
      but they compete mainly on price offers extensive assortment of
      merchandise at affordable and cut-rate prices. Normally retailers sell
      less fashion-oriented brands.
    * _W_a_r_e_h_o_u_s_e_ _s_t_o_r_e_s - warehouses that offer low-cost, often high-quantity
      goods piled on pallets or steel shelves; _w_a_r_e_h_o_u_s_e_ _c_l_u_b_s charge a
      membership fee;
    * _V_a_r_i_e_t_y_ _s_t_o_r_e_s - these offer extremely low-cost goods, with limited
      selection;
    * Demographic - retailers that aim at one particular segment (e.g., high-
      end retailers focusing on wealthy individuals).
    * Mom-And-Pop : is a small retail outlet owned and operated by an
      individual or family. Focuses on a relatively limited and selective set
      of products.
    * _S_p_e_c_i_a_l_t_y_ _s_t_o_r_e_s: A typical speciality store gives attention to a
      particular category and provides high level of service to the customers.
      A pet store that specializes in selling dog food would be regarded as a
      specialty store. However, branded stores also come under this format. For
      example if a customer visits a Reebok or Gap store then they find just
      Reebok and Gap products in the respective stores.
    * _B_o_u_t_i_q_u_e_s or Concept stores are similar to specialty stores. Concept
      stores are very small in size, and only ever stock one brand. They are
      run by the brand that controls them. An example of brand that distributes
      largely through their own widely distributed concept stores is _L_'_O_C_C_I_T_A_N_E
      _e_n_ _P_r_o_v_e_n_c_e. The limited size and offering of L'OCCITANE's stores are too
      small to be considered a specialty store proper.
    * _G_e_n_e_r_a_l_ _s_t_o_r_e - a rural store that supplies the main needs for the local
      community;
    * _C_o_n_v_e_n_i_e_n_c_e_ _s_t_o_r_e_s: is essentially found in residential areas. They
      provide limited amount of merchandise at more than average prices with a
      speedy checkout. This store is ideal for emergency and immediate
      purchases as it often works with extended hours, stocking everyday;
    * _H_y_p_e_r_m_a_r_k_e_t_s: provides variety and huge volumes of exclusive merchandise
      at low margins. The operating cost is comparatively less than other
      retail formats.
    * _S_u_p_e_r_m_a_r_k_e_t_s: is a self-service store consisting mainly of grocery and
      limited products on non food items. They may adopt a Hi-Lo or an EDLP
      strategy for pricing. The supermarkets can be anywhere between 20,000 and
      40,000 square feet (3,700 m2). Example: SPAR supermarket.
    * _M_a_l_l_s: has a range of retail shops at a single outlet. They endow with
      products, food and entertainment under a roof.
    * _C_a_t_e_g_o_r_y_ _k_i_l_l_e_r_s or Category Specialist: By supplying wide assortment in
      a single category for lower prices a retailer can "kill" that category
      for other retailers. For few categories, such as electronics, the
      products are displayed at the centre of the store and sales person will
      be available to address customer queries and give suggestions when
      required. Other retail format stores are forced to reduce the prices if a
      category specialist retail store is present in the vicinity.
    * _E_-_t_a_i_l_e_r_s: The customer can shop and order through internet and the
      merchandise are dropped at the customer's doorstep. Here the retailers
      use drop shipping technique. They accept the payment for the product but
      the customer receives the product directly from the manufacturer or a
      wholesaler. This format is ideal for customers who do not want to travel
      to retail stores and are interested in home shopping. However it is
      important for the customer to be wary about defective products and non
      secure credit card transaction. Example: Amazon, Pennyful and eBay.
    * _V_e_n_d_i_n_g_ _M_a_c_h_i_n_e_s: This is an automated piece of equipment wherein
      customers can drop the money in the machine and acquire the products.
Some stores take a _n_o_ _f_r_i_l_l_s approach, while others are "mid-range" or "high
end", depending on what income level they target.
Other types of retail store include:
    * _A_u_t_o_m_a_t_e_d_ _R_e_t_a_i_l stores are self-service, robotic kiosks located in
      airports, malls and grocery stores. The stores accept credit cards and
      are usually open 24/7. Examples include _Z_o_o_m_S_h_o_p_s and _R_e_d_b_o_x.
    * _B_i_g_-_b_o_x_ _s_t_o_r_e_s encompass larger department, discount, general
      merchandise, and warehouse stores.
Retailers can opt for a format as each provides different retail mix to its
customers based on their customer demographics, lifestyle and purchase
behaviour. A good format will lend a hand to display products well and entice
the target customers to spawn sales.

The _p_r_i_c_i_n_g technique used by most retailers is _c_o_s_t_-_p_l_u_s_ _p_r_i_c_i_n_g. This
involves adding a _m_a_r_k_u_p amount (or percentage) to the retailer's cost. Another
common technique is _s_u_g_g_e_s_t_e_d_ _r_e_t_a_i_l_ _p_r_i_c_i_n_g. This simply involves charging the
amount suggested by the manufacturer and usually printed on the _p_r_o_d_u_c_t by the
manufacturer.
In Western countries, retail _p_r_i_c_e_s are often called _p_s_y_c_h_o_l_o_g_i_c_a_l_ _p_r_i_c_e_s or
odd prices. Often prices are fixed and displayed on signs or labels.
Alternatively, when prices are not clearly displayed, there can be _p_r_i_c_e
_d_i_s_c_r_i_m_i_n_a_t_i_o_n, where the sale price is dependent upon who the customer is. For
example, a customer may have to pay more if the seller determines that he or
she is willing and/or able to. Another example would be the practice of
discounting for youths, students, or senior citizens.

Because patronage at a retail outlet varies flexibility in _s_c_h_e_d_u_l_i_n_g is

workers in the United States were part-time. This may result in financial

to meet their family and other obligations._[_3_]

There are several ways in which consumers can receive goods from a retailer:
    * _C_o_u_n_t_e_r_ _s_e_r_v_i_c_e, where goods are out of reach of buyers and must be
      obtained from the seller. This type of retail is common for small
      expensive items (e.g. jewelry) and controlled items like medicine and
      liquor. It was common before the 1900s in the United States and is more
      common in certain countries like India.[_w_h_i_c_h_?]
    * _D_e_l_i_v_e_r_y, where goods are shipped directly to consumer's homes or
      workplaces. _M_a_i_l_ _o_r_d_e_r from a printed catalog was invented in 1744 and
      was common in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Ordering by

Some shops sell second-hand goods. In the case of a _n_o_n_p_r_o_f_i_t shop, the public
donates goods to the shop to be sold. In _g_i_v_e_-_a_w_a_y_ _s_h_o_p_s goods can be taken for

Another form is the _p_a_w_n_s_h_o_p, in which goods are sold that were used as
collateral for loans. There are also "_c_o_n_s_i_g_n_m_e_n_t" shops, which are where a
person can place an item in a store and if it sells, the person gives the shop
owner a percentage of the sale price. The advantage of selling an item this way
is that the established shop gives the item exposure to more potential buyers.

Behind the scenes at retail, there is another factor at work. Corporations and
independent store owners alike are always trying to get the edge on their
competitors. One way to do this is to hire a _m_e_r_c_h_a_n_d_i_s_i_n_g solutions company to
design custom store displays that will attract more customers in a certain
demographic. The nation's largest retailers spend millions every year on in-
store _m_a_r_k_e_t_i_n_g programs that correspond to seasonal and promotional changes.
As products change, so will a retail landscape. Retailers can also use _f_a_c_i_n_g
techniques to create the look of a perfectly stocked store, even when it is
not.
A destination store is one that customers will initiate a trip specifically to
visit, sometimes over a large area. These stores are often used to "_a_n_c_h_o_r" a
shopping mall or plaza, generating foot traffic, which is capitalized upon by
smaller retailers.

_C_u_s_t_o_m_e_r_ _s_e_r_v_i_c_e is the "sum of acts and elements that allow consumers to
receive what they need or desire from your retail establishment." It is
important for a sales associate to greet the customer and make himself
available to help the customer find whatever he needs. When a customer enters
the store, it is important that the sales associate does everything in his
power to make the customer feel welcomed, important, and make sure he leaves
the store satisfied. Giving the customer full, undivided attention and helping
him find what he is looking for will contribute to the customer's satisfaction.
_[_4_] For retail store owners, it is extremely important to train yourself and
your staff to provide excellent customer service skills. By providing excellent
customer service, you build a good relationship with the customer and
eventually will attract more new customers and turn them into regular
customers. Looking at long term perspectives, excellent customer skills give
your retail business a good ongoing _r_e_p_u_t_a_t_i_o_n and competitive advantage._[_5_]
