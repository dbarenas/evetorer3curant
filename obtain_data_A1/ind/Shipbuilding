Shipbuilding and ship repairs, both commercial and military, are referred to as
"naval engineering". The construction of _b_o_a_t_s is a similar activity called
_b_o_a_t_ _b_u_i_l_d_i_n_g.
The dismantling of ships is called _s_h_i_p_ _b_r_e_a_k_i_n_g.

Archaeological evidence indicates that humans arrived on _B_o_r_n_e_o at least
120,000 years ago, probably by sea from the _A_s_i_a_n mainland during an _i_c_e_ _a_g_e

Evidence from _A_n_c_i_e_n_t_ _E_g_y_p_t shows that the early _E_g_y_p_t_i_a_n_s knew how to assemble
planks of wood into a _s_h_i_p_ _h_u_l_l as early as 3000 BC. The _A_r_c_h_a_e_o_l_o_g_i_c_a_l

known as the _A_b_y_d_o_s_ _b_o_a_t_s. These are a group of 14 discovered ships in _A_b_y_d_o_s
that were constructed of wooden planks which were "sewn" together. Discovered
by Egyptologist David O'Connor of _N_e_w_ _Y_o_r_k_ _U_n_i_v_e_r_s_i_t_y,_[_2_] woven _s_t_r_a_p_s were

originally they were all thought to have belonged to him, but one of the 14
ships dates to 3000 BC,_[_2_] and the associated pottery jars buried with the
vessels also suggest earlier dating._[_2_] The ship dating to 3000 BC was about
25 m, 75 feet long_[_2_] and is now thought to perhaps have belonged to an earlier
pharaoh._[_2_] According to professor O'Connor, the 5,000-year-old ship may have
even belonged to _P_h_a_r_a_o_h_ _A_h_a._[_2_]

Early Egyptians also knew how to assemble planks of wood with _t_r_e_e_n_a_i_l_s to
fasten them together, using _p_i_t_c_h for _c_a_u_l_k_i_n_g the seams. The "_K_h_u_f_u_ _s_h_i_p", a

surviving example which may have fulfilled the symbolic function of a _s_o_l_a_r
_b_a_r_q_u_e. Early Egyptians also knew how to fasten the planks of this ship
together with _m_o_r_t_i_s_e_ _a_n_d_ _t_e_n_o_n joints._[_1_]
The oldest known tidal dock in the world was built around 2500 BC during the

_G_u_j_a_r_a_t coast in _I_n_d_i_a. Other ports were probably at _B_a_l_a_k_o_t and _D_w_a_r_k_a.
However, it is probable that many small-scale ports, and not massive ports,
were used for the Harappan maritime trade._[_3_] Ships from the harbour at these
ancient port cities established trade with _M_e_s_o_p_o_t_a_m_i_a._[_4_] Shipbuilding and
boatmaking may have been prosperous industries in ancient India._[_5_] Native
labourers may have manufactured the flotilla of boats used by _A_l_e_x_a_n_d_e_r_ _t_h_e
_G_r_e_a_t to navigate across the _H_y_d_a_s_p_e_s and even the _I_n_d_u_s, under _N_e_a_r_c_h_o_s._[_5_]
The Indians also exported _t_e_a_k for shipbuilding to ancient _P_e_r_s_i_a._[_6_] Other

The ships of Ancient Egypt's _E_i_g_h_t_e_e_n_t_h_ _D_y_n_a_s_t_y were typically about 25 meters
(80 ft) in length, and had a single _m_a_s_t, sometimes consisting of two poles
lashed together at the top making an "A" shape. They mounted a single square
_s_a_i_l on a _y_a_r_d, with an additional _s_p_a_r along the bottom of the sail. These
ships could also be _o_a_r propelled._[_7_]
The ships of _P_h_o_e_n_i_c_i_a seem to have been of a similar design. The _G_r_e_e_k_s and
probably others introduced the use of multiple banks of oars for additional
speed, and the ships were of a light construction for speed and so they could
be carried ashore.

Viking _l_o_n_g_s_h_i_p_s developed from an alternate tradition of _c_l_i_n_k_e_r-built hulls
fastened with _l_e_a_t_h_e_r thongs[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]. Sometime around the 12th
century, northern European ships began to be built with a straight _s_t_e_r_n_p_o_s_t,
enabling the mounting of a rudder, which was much more durable than a _s_t_e_e_r_i_n_g
_o_a_r held over the side. Development in the _M_i_d_d_l_e_ _A_g_e_s favored "_r_o_u_n_d_ _s_h_i_p_s",
with a broad beam and heavily curved at both ends. Another important ship type
was the galley which was constructed with both sails and oars.
An insight into ship building in the North Sea/Baltic areas of the early
medieval period was found at Sutton Hoo, England, where a ship was buried with
a chieftain. the ship was 26 metres (85 ft) long and, 4.3 metres (14 ft)_[_8_]
wide. Upward from the keel, the hull was made by overlapping nine planks on
either side with rivets fastening the oaken planks together. It could hold
upwards of thirty men.
The first extant treatise on shipbuilding was written ca. 1436 by Michael of
Rhodes,_[_9_] a man who began his career as an oarsman on a Venetian galley in
1401 and worked his way up into officer positions. He wrote and illustrated a
book that contains a treatise on ship building, a treatise on mathematics, much
material on astrology, and other materials. His treatise on shipbuilding treats
three kinds of galleys and two kinds of round ships._[_1_0_]
Outside Medieval Europe, great advances were being made in shipbuilding. The
shipbuilding industry in _I_m_p_e_r_i_a_l_ _C_h_i_n_a reached its height during the _S_u_n_g
_D_y_n_a_s_t_y, _Y_u_a_n_ _D_y_n_a_s_t_y, and early _M_i_n_g_ _D_y_n_a_s_t_y, building commercial vessels that
by the end of this period were to reach a size and sophistication far exceeding
that of contemporary Europe. The mainstay of China's merchant and naval fleets
was the _j_u_n_k, which had existed for centuries, but it was at this time that the
large ships based on this design were built. During the Sung period (960‚Äì1279
AD), the establishment of China's first official standing navy in 1132 AD and
the enormous increase in maritime trade abroad (from _H_e_i_a_n _J_a_p_a_n to _F_a_t_i_m_i_d
_E_g_y_p_t) allowed the shipbuilding industry in provinces like _F_u_j_i_a_n to thrive as
never before. The largest _s_e_a_p_o_r_t_s in the world were in China and included
_G_u_a_n_g_z_h_o_u, _Q_u_a_n_z_h_o_u, and _X_i_a_m_e_n.
In the Islamic world, shipbuilding thrived at _B_a_s_r_a and _A_l_e_x_a_n_d_r_i_a, the _d_h_o_w,
_f_e_l_u_c_c_a, _b_a_g_h_l_a_h and the _s_a_m_b_u_k, became symbols of successful maritime trade
around the _I_n_d_i_a_n_ _O_c_e_a_n; from the ports of _E_a_s_t_ _A_f_r_i_c_a to _S_o_u_t_h_e_a_s_t_ _A_s_i_a and
the ports of _S_i_n_d_h and _H_i_n_d (India) during the _A_b_b_a_s_i_d period.
At this time islands spread over vast distances across the _P_a_c_i_f_i_c_ _O_c_e_a_n were
being colonised by the Melenesians and Polynesians, who built giant canoes and
progressed to great catamarans.

With the development of the _c_a_r_r_a_c_k, the west moved into a new era of ship
construction by building the first regular ocean going vessels. In a relatively
short time, these ships grew to an unprecedented size, complexity and cost.
Shipyards became large industrial complexes and the ships built were financed
by consortia of investors These considerations led to the documentation of
design and construction practices in what had previously been a secretive trade
run by master shipwrights, and ultimately led to the field of _n_a_v_a_l
_a_r_c_h_i_t_e_c_t_u_r_e, where professional designers and draughtsmen played an
increasingly important role._[_1_1_] Even so, construction techniques changed only
very gradually. The ships of the _N_a_p_o_l_e_o_n_i_c_ _W_a_r_s were still built more or less
to the same basic plan as those of the _S_p_a_n_i_s_h_ _A_r_m_a_d_a of two centuries earlier
but there had been numerous subtle improvements in ship design and construction
throughout this period. For instance, the introduction of _t_u_m_b_l_e_h_o_m_e;
adjustments to the shapes of sails and hulls; the introduction of the wheel;
the introduction of hardened copper fastenings below the waterline; the
introduction of copper sheathing as a deterrent to shipworm and fouling; etc.

Babbitt's _r_o_t_a_r_y_ _e_n_g_i_n_e.
The industrial revolution made possible the use of new materials and designs
that radically altered shipbuilding. Other than its widespread use in
fastenings, _I_r_o_n was gradually adopted in ship construction, initially in
discrete areas in a wooden hull needing greater strength, (e.g. as deck knees,
hanging knees, knee riders and the like). Then, in the form of plates rivetted
together and made watertight, it was used to form the hull itself. Initially
copying wooden construction traditions with a frame over which the hull was
fastened, _I_s_a_m_b_a_r_d_ _K_i_n_g_d_o_m_ _B_r_u_n_e_l's _G_r_e_a_t_ _B_r_i_t_a_i_n of 1843 was the first radical
new design, being built entirely of wrought iron. Despite her success, and the
great savings in cost and space provided by the iron hull, compared to a copper
sheathed counterpart, there remained problems with fouling due to the adherence
of weeds and barnacles. As a result _c_o_m_p_o_s_i_t_e_ _c_o_n_s_t_r_u_c_t_i_o_n remained the
dominant approach where fast ships were required, with wooden timbers laid over
an iron frame (the _C_u_t_t_y_ _S_a_r_k is a famous example). Later Great Britain's iron
hull was sheathed in wood to enable it to carry a _c_o_p_p_e_r_-_b_a_s_e_d_ _s_h_e_a_t_h_i_n_g.
Brunel's _G_r_e_a_t_ _E_a_s_t_e_r_n represented the next great development in shipbuilding.
Built in association with _J_o_h_n_ _S_c_o_t_t_ _R_u_s_s_e_l_l, it used longitudinal _s_t_r_i_n_g_e_r_s
for strength, inner and outer hulls, and _b_u_l_k_h_e_a_d_s to form multiple watertight
compartments. _S_t_e_e_l also supplanted _w_r_o_u_g_h_t_ _i_r_o_n when it became readily
available in the latter half of the 19th century, providing great savings when
compared with iron in cost and weight. Wood continued to be favored for the
decks, and is still the rule as deckcovering for modern _c_r_u_i_s_e_ _s_h_i_p_s. Scotts

After the Second World War, shipbuilding (which encompasses the shipyards, the
marine equipment manufacturers, and many related _s_e_r_v_i_c_e and _k_n_o_w_l_e_d_g_e
providers) grew as an important and strategic industry in a number of countries
around the world. This importance stems from:
    * The large number of _s_k_i_l_l_e_d_ _w_o_r_k_e_r_s required directly by the shipyard,
      along with supporting industries such as _s_t_e_e_l_ _m_i_l_l_s, railroads and
      _e_n_g_i_n_e manufacturers; and
    * A nation's need to manufacture and repair its own _n_a_v_y and vessels that
      support its _p_r_i_m_a_r_y_ _i_n_d_u_s_t_r_i_e_s
Historically, the industry has suffered from the absence of _g_l_o_b_a_l_ _r_u_l_e_s and a
tendency towards (_s_t_a_t_e-_s_u_p_p_o_r_t_e_d) over-investment due to the fact that
shipyards offer a wide range of technologies, employ a significant number of
workers, and generate income as the shipbuilding market is _g_l_o_b_a_l.
Shipbuilding is therefore an attractive industry for _d_e_v_e_l_o_p_i_n_g_ _n_a_t_i_o_n_s. _J_a_p_a_n
used shipbuilding in the 1950s and 1960s to rebuild its industrial structure;
_S_o_u_t_h_ _K_o_r_e_a started to make shipbuilding a strategic industry in the 1970s, and
China is now in the process of repeating these models with large state-
supported investments in this industry. Conversely, Croatia is privatising its
shipbuilding industry.
As a result, the world shipbuilding market suffers from over-capacities,
depressed prices (although the industry experienced a price increase in the
period 2003‚Äì2005 due to strong demand for new ships which was in excess of
actual cost increases), low profit margins, trade distortions and widespread
subsidisation. All efforts to address the problems in the OECD have so far
failed, with the 1994 international shipbuilding agreement never entering into
force and the 2003‚Äì2005 round of negotiations being paused in September 2005
after no agreement was possible. After numerous efforts to restart the
negotiations these were formally terminated in December 2010. The OECD's
Council Working Party on Shipbuilding (WP6) will continue its efforts to
identify and progressively reduce factors that distort the shipbuilding market.
Where _s_t_a_t_e _s_u_b_s_i_d_i_e_s have been removed and domestic _i_n_d_u_s_t_r_i_a_l_ _p_o_l_i_c_i_e_s do not
provide support, in high-cost nations shipbuilding has usually gone into
steady, if not rapid, decline. The British shipbuilding industry is a prime
example of this. From a position in the early 1970s where British yards could
still build the largest types of sophisticated merchant ships, British
shipbuilders today have been reduced to a handful specialising in defence
contracts and repair work. In the U.S.A., the _J_o_n_e_s_ _A_c_t (which places
restrictions on the ships that can be used for moving domestic cargoes) has
meant that merchant shipbuilding has continued, but such protection has failed
to penalise shipbuilding inefficiencies. The consequence of this is contract
prices that are far higher than those of any other nation building oceangoing
ships.

_J_a_p_a_n had been the dominant ship building country from the 1960s through to the
end of 1990s but gradually lost its competitive advantage to the emerging
industry in South Korea which had the advantages of much cheaper wages, strong
government backing and a cheaper currency. South Korean production overtook
Japan's in 2003 and Japanese _m_a_r_k_e_t_ _s_h_a_r_e has since fallen sharply. The market
share of _E_u_r_o_p_e_a_n ship builders began to decline in the 1960s as they lost work
to the Japanese in the same way as Japanese builders have lost work to South
Koreans more recently; Europe's production is now a tenth of South Korea's and
is primarily military, although cruise liners and some cargo ships are still
built in Italy, Finland, France, Germany and Denmark. The output of the United
States also underwent a similar change._[_1_6_]_[_1_7_]

the yard, transported to the building dock or slipway, then lifted into place.
This is known as "block construction". The most modern shipyards pre-install
equipment, pipes, electrical cables, and any other components within the
blocks, to minimize the effort needed to assemble or install components deep
within the hull once it is welded together.
Ship design work, also called _n_a_v_a_l_ _a_r_c_h_i_t_e_c_t_u_r_e, may be conducted using a _s_h_i_p
_m_o_d_e_l_ _b_a_s_i_n. Modern ships, since roughly 1940, have been produced almost
exclusively of _w_e_l_d_e_d steel. Early welded steel ships used steels with
inadequate _f_r_a_c_t_u_r_e_ _t_o_u_g_h_n_e_s_s, which resulted in some ships suffering

_s_h_i_p). Since roughly 1950, specialized steels such as _A_B_S_ _S_t_e_e_l_s with good
properties for ship construction have been used. Although it is commonly
accepted that modern steel has eliminated brittle fracture in ships, some
controversy still exists._[_2_0_] Brittle fracture of modern vessels continues to
occur from time to time because grade A and grade B steel of unknown toughness
or fracture appearance transition temperature (FATT) in ships' side shells can
be less than adequate for all ambient conditions._[_2_1_]

All ships need maintenance and repairs. A part of these jobs must be carried
out under the supervision of the Classification Society. A lot of maintenance
is carried out while at sea or in port by ship's staff. However a large number
of repair and maintenance works can only be carried out while the ship is out
of commercial operation, in a Shiprepair Yard. Prior to undergoing repairs,
tankers must dock at a Deballasting Station for completing the tank cleaning
operations and pumping ashore its slops (dirty cleaning water and hydrocarbon
residues).
