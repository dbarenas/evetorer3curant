Sport in _c_h_i_l_d_h_o_o_d. _A_s_s_o_c_i_a_t_i_o_n_ _f_o_o_t_b_a_l_l, shown above, is a _t_e_a_m_ _s_p_o_r_t which

_[_1_] through casual or organised participation, aim to use, maintain or improve
physical ability and skills while providing _e_n_t_e_r_t_a_i_n_m_e_n_t to participants, and
in some cases, spectators._[_2_] Hundreds of sports exist, from those requiring
only two participants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous
participants, either in _t_e_a_m_s or competing as individuals.
Sport is generally recognised as activities which are based in physical
_a_t_h_l_e_t_i_c_i_s_m or physical _d_e_x_t_e_r_i_t_y, with the largest major competitions such as
the _O_l_y_m_p_i_c_ _G_a_m_e_s admitting only sports meeting this definition,_[_3_] and other
organisations such as the _C_o_u_n_c_i_l_ _o_f_ _E_u_r_o_p_e using definitions precluding
activities without a physical element from classification as sports._[_2_]
However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim
recognition as _m_i_n_d_ _s_p_o_r_t_s. The International Olympic Committee (through _A_R_I_S_F)
recognises both _c_h_e_s_s and _b_r_i_d_g_e as bona fide sports, and _S_p_o_r_t_A_c_c_o_r_d, the
international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical
sports,_[_4_]_[_5_] although limits the amount of mind games which can be admitted as
sports._[_1_]
Sports are usually governed by a set of _r_u_l_e_s or _c_u_s_t_o_m_s, which serve to ensure
fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. Winning can
be determined by physical events such as scoring _g_o_a_l_s or crossing a line
first, or by the determination of judges who are scoring elements of the
sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as
technical performance or artistic impression.
In organised sport, records of performance are often kept, and for popular
sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in _s_p_o_r_t_ _n_e_w_s. In
addition, sport is a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with
_s_p_e_c_t_a_t_o_r_ _s_p_o_r_t_s drawing large crowds to venues, and reaching wider audiences
through _s_p_o_r_t_s_ _b_r_o_a_d_c_a_s_t_i_n_g.

"Sport" comes from the _O_l_d_ _F_r_e_n_c_h desport meaning "leisure", with the oldest
definition in English from around 1300 being "anything humans find amusing or
entertaining"._[_6_]
Other meanings include gambling and events staged for the purpose of gambling;
hunting; and games and diversions, including ones that require exercise._[_7_]
Roget's defines the noun sport as an "activity engaged in for relaxation and
amusement" with synonyms including diversion and recreation._[_8_]

The singular term "sport" is used in most English dialects to describe the
overall concept (e.g. "children taking part in sport"), with "sports" used to
describe multiple activities (e.g. "football and rugby are the most popular
sports in England"). American English uses "sports" for both terms.

The precise definition of what separates a sport from other leisure activities
varies between sources, with no universally agreed definition. The closest to
an international agreement on a definition is provided by _S_p_o_r_t_A_c_c_o_r_d, which is
the association for all the largest international sports federations (including
_a_s_s_o_c_i_a_t_i_o_n_ _f_o_o_t_b_a_l_l, _a_t_h_l_e_t_i_c_s, _c_y_c_l_i_n_g, _t_e_n_n_i_s, _e_q_u_e_s_t_r_i_a_n_ _s_p_o_r_t_s and more),
and is therefore the de facto representative of international sport.
SportAccord uses the following criteria, determining that a sport should:_[_1_]
    * have an element of competition
    * be in no way harmful to any living creature
    * not rely on equipment provided by a single supplier (excluding
      proprietary games such as _a_r_e_n_a_ _f_o_o_t_b_a_l_l)
    * not rely on any "luck" element specifically designed into the sport
They also recognise that sport can be primarily physical (such as _r_u_g_b_y or
_a_t_h_l_e_t_i_c_s), primarily mind (such as _c_h_e_s_s or _g_o), predominantly motorised (such
as _F_o_r_m_u_l_a_ _1 or _p_o_w_e_r_b_o_a_t_i_n_g), primarily co-ordination (such as _b_i_l_l_i_a_r_d
_s_p_o_r_t_s), or primarily animal-supported (such as _e_q_u_e_s_t_r_i_a_n_ _s_p_o_r_t)._[_1_]
There has been an increase in the application of the term "sport" to a wider
set of non-physical challenges such as _e_l_e_c_t_r_o_n_i_c_ _s_p_o_r_t_s, especially due to the
large scale of participation and organised competition, but these are not
widely recognised by mainstream sports organisations.
******** CCoommppeettiittiioonn ********
There are opposing views on the necessity of _c_o_m_p_e_t_i_t_i_o_n as a defining element
of a sport, with almost all _p_r_o_f_e_s_s_i_o_n_a_l_ _s_p_o_r_t involving competition, and
governing bodies requiring competition as a prerequisite of recognition by the
International Olympic Committee(IOC) or SportAccord._[_1_]
Other bodies advocate widening the definition of sport to include all physical
activity. For instance, the _C_o_u_n_c_i_l_ _o_f_ _E_u_r_o_p_e include all forms of physical
exercise, including those completed just for fun.
In order to widen participation, and reduce the impact of losing on less able
participants, there has been an introduction of non-competitive physical
activity to traditionally competitive events such as school _s_p_o_r_t_s_ _d_a_y_s,
although moves like this are often controversial._[_9_]_[_1_0_]
In competitive events, participants are graded or classified based on their
"result" and often divided into groups of comparable performance, (e.g. gender,
weight and age). For each group, the first in the list will usually be the
"winner". The measurement of the result may be objective or subjective, and
corrected with "handicaps" or penalties. In a race, for example, the time to
complete the course is an objective measurement. In _g_y_m_n_a_s_t_i_c_s or _d_i_v_i_n_g the
result is decided by a panel of judges, and therefore subjective. There are
many shades in between, like boxing, where victory is assigned by judges if
both competitors are still standing at the end of the match time.

There are artifacts and structures that suggest that the _C_h_i_n_e_s_e engaged in
sporting activities as early as 2000 BC._[_1_1_] Gymnastics appears to have been a
popular sport in China's ancient past. Monuments to the Pharaohs indicate that
a number of sports, including swimming and fishing, were well-developed and
regulated several thousands of years ago in ancient Egypt._[_1_2_] Other Egyptian
sports included javelin throwing, high jump, and wrestling. Ancient Persian
sports such as the traditional _I_r_a_n_i_a_n martial art of _Z_o_u_r_k_h_a_n_e_h had a close
connection to the warfare skills._[_1_3_] Among other sports that originate in
ancient _P_e_r_s_i_a are _p_o_l_o and _j_o_u_s_t_i_n_g.
_M_o_t_o_r_i_z_e_d_ _s_p_o_r_t_s have appeared since the advent of the modern age
A wide range of sports were already established by the time of _A_n_c_i_e_n_t_ _G_r_e_e_c_e
and the military culture and the development of sports in Greece influenced one
another considerably. Sports became such a prominent part of their culture that
the Greeks created the Olympic Games, which in ancient times were held every
four years in a small village in the _P_e_l_o_p_o_n_n_e_s_u_s called _O_l_y_m_p_i_a._[_1_4_]
Sports have been increasingly organised and regulated from the time of the
ancient Olympics up to the present century. Industrialisation has brought
increased leisure time to the citizens of developed and developing countries,
leading to more time for citizens to attend and follow spectator sports,
greater participation in athletic activities, and increased accessibility.
These trends continued with the advent of mass media and global communication.
Professionalism became prevalent, further adding to the increase in sport's
popularity, as sports fans began following the exploits of professional
athletes through radio, television, and the internet ‚Äî all while enjoying the
exercise and competition associated with amateur participation in sports.

Sportsmanship is an attitude that strives for fair play, courtesy toward
teammates and opponents, ethical behaviour and integrity, and grace in victory
or defeat._[_1_5_]_[_1_6_]_[_1_7_]
Sportsmanship expresses an aspiration or ethos that the activity will be
enjoyed for its own sake. The well-known sentiment by sports journalist
_G_r_a_n_t_l_a_n_d_ _R_i_c_e, that it's "not that you won or lost but how you played the
game", and the modern Olympic creed expressed by its founder _P_i_e_r_r_e_ _d_e
_C_o_u_b_e_r_t_i_n: "The most important thing... is not winning but taking part" are
typical expressions of this sentiment.

Key principles of sport include that the result should not be predetermined,
and that both sides should have equal opportunity to win. Rules are in place to
ensure that fair play to occur, but participants can break these rules in order
to gain advantage.
Participants may choose to cheat in order to satisfy their desire to win, or in
order to achieve an ulterior motive. The widespread existence of _g_a_m_b_l_i_n_g on
the results of sports fixtures creates the motivation for _m_a_t_c_h_ _f_i_x_i_n_g, where a
participant or participants deliberately work to ensure a given outcome.

The competitive nature of sport encourages some participants to attempt to
enhance their performance through the use of medicines, or through other means
such as increasing the volume of blood in their bodies through artificial
means.
All sports recognised by the IOC or SportAccord are required to implement a
testing programme, looking for a list of banned drugs, with suspensions or bans
being placed on participants who test positive for banned substances.

The competition element of sport, along with the aesthetic appeal of some
sports, result in the popularity of people attending to watch sport being
played. This has led to the specific phenomenon of _s_p_e_c_t_a_t_o_r_ _s_p_o_r_t.
Both amateur and professional sports attract spectators, both in person at the
sport venue, and through broadcast mediums including _r_a_d_i_o, _t_e_l_e_v_i_s_i_o_n and
_i_n_t_e_r_n_e_t broadcast. Both attendance in person and viewing remotely can incur a
sometimes substantial charge, such as an entrance ticket, or _p_a_y_-_p_e_r_-_v_i_e_w
television broadcast.
It is common for popular sports to attract large broadcast audiences, leading
to rival broadcasters bidding large amounts of money for the rights to show
certain fixtures. The football _W_o_r_l_d_ _C_u_p attracts a global _t_e_l_e_v_i_s_i_o_n audience
of hundreds of millions; the _2_0_0_6 _f_i_n_a_l alone attracted an estimated worldwide
audience of well over 700 million and the _2_0_1_1_ _C_r_i_c_k_e_t_ _W_o_r_l_d_ _C_u_p_ _F_i_n_a_l
attracted an estimated audience of 135 million in India alone ._[_1_9_]

Modern sports have complex _r_u_l_e_s and are highly organized.

Sport can be undertaken on an amateur, professional or semi-professional basis,
depending on whether participants are incentivised for participation (usually
through payment of a _w_a_g_e or _s_a_l_a_r_y).
The popularity of _s_p_e_c_t_a_t_o_r_ _s_p_o_r_t as a recreation for non-participants has led
to sport becoming a major business in its own right, and this has incentivised
a high paying _p_r_o_f_e_s_s_i_o_n_a_l_ _s_p_o_r_t culture, where high performing participants
are rewarded with pay far in excess of average wages, which can run into
millions of dollars._[_2_0_]
Some sports, or individual competitions within a sport, retain a policy of
allowing only _a_m_a_t_e_u_r_ _s_p_o_r_t. The _O_l_y_m_p_i_c_ _G_a_m_e_s started with a principle of
amateur competition with those who practiced a sport professionally considered
to have an unfair advantage over those who practiced it merely as a hobby._[_2_1_]
Following the 1988 games, the IOC decided to make all professional athletes
eligible for the Olympics, with only _b_o_x_i_n_g and _w_r_e_s_t_l_i_n_g still competed on an
"amateur" basis, although this revolves around rules, and not payment.
GGrraassssrroooottss ssppoorrtt is a popular phrase which covers the amateur participation in
sport at lower levels, normally without pretension towards higher achievement,
and is in line with the "sport for all" mentality, where enjoyment is the
primary reason for participation._[_2_]_[_2_2_]

Technology plays an important part in modern sport, with it being a necessary
part of some sports (such as motorsport), and used in others to improve
performance.
_S_p_o_r_t_s_ _s_c_i_e_n_c_e is a widespread academic discipline, and can be applied to areas
including athlete performance, such as the use of video analysis to fine tune
technique, or to equipment, such as improved _r_u_n_n_i_n_g_ _s_h_o_e_s or _c_o_m_p_e_t_i_t_i_v_e
_s_w_i_m_w_e_a_r.
_S_p_o_r_t_s_ _e_n_g_i_n_e_e_r_i_n_g emerged as a discipline in 1998 with an increasing focus not
just on materials design but also the use of technology in sport.
In order to control the impact of technology on fair play, governing bodies
frequently have specific rules that are set to control the impact of technical
advantage between participants.

Sports and politics can influence each other greatly.
When _a_p_a_r_t_h_e_i_d was the official policy in _S_o_u_t_h_ _A_f_r_i_c_a, many sports people,
particularly in _r_u_g_b_y_ _u_n_i_o_n, adopted the conscientious approach that they
should not appear in competitive sports there. Some feel this was an effective
contribution to the eventual demolition of the policy of apartheid, others feel
that it may have prolonged and reinforced its worst effects._[_2_3_]
The _1_9_3_6_ _S_u_m_m_e_r_ _O_l_y_m_p_i_c_s held in _B_e_r_l_i_n was an _i_l_l_u_s_t_r_a_t_i_o_n, perhaps best
recognised in retrospect, where an ideology was developing which used the event
to strengthen its spread through propaganda.
In the history of _I_r_e_l_a_n_d, Gaelic sports were connected with _c_u_l_t_u_r_a_l
_n_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_i_s_m. Until the mid 20th century a person could have been banned from
playing _G_a_e_l_i_c_ _f_o_o_t_b_a_l_l, _h_u_r_l_i_n_g, or other sports administered by the _G_a_e_l_i_c
_A_t_h_l_e_t_i_c_ _A_s_s_o_c_i_a_t_i_o_n (GAA) if she/he played or supported _f_o_o_t_b_a_l_l, or other
games seen to be of _B_r_i_t_i_s_h origin. Until recently the GAA continued to ban the
playing of football and _r_u_g_b_y_ _u_n_i_o_n at Gaelic venues. This ban is still
enforced, but was modified to allow football and rugby to be played in _C_r_o_k_e
_P_a_r_k while _L_a_n_s_d_o_w_n_e_ _R_o_a_d was redeveloped into _A_v_i_v_a_ _S_t_a_d_i_u_m. Until recently,
under Rule 21, the GAA also banned members of the British security forces and
members of the _R_U_C from playing Gaelic games, but the advent of the _G_o_o_d_ _F_r_i_d_a_y
_A_g_r_e_e_m_e_n_t in 1998 led to the eventual removal of the ban.
_N_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_i_s_m is often evident in the pursuit of sports, or in its reporting:
people compete in national teams, or commentators and audiences can adopt a
partisan view. On occasion, such tensions can lead to violent confrontation
among players or spectators within and beyond the sporting venue, as in the
_F_o_o_t_b_a_l_l_ _W_a_r. These trends are seen by many as contrary to the fundamental
ethos of sports being carried on for its own sake and for the enjoyment of its
participants.
A very famous case when sports and politics collided was the 1972 Olympics in
Munich. Masked men entered the hotel of the Israeli olympic team and killed
many of their men. This was known as the _M_u_n_i_c_h_ _m_a_s_s_a_c_r_e.
