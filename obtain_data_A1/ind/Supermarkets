A ssuuppeerrmmaarrkkeett, a large form of the traditional _g_r_o_c_e_r_y_ _s_t_o_r_e, is a _s_e_l_f_-_s_e_r_v_i_c_e
_s_h_o_p offering a wide variety of _f_o_o_d and household products, organized into
aisles. It is larger in size and has a wider selection than a traditional
grocery store, but is smaller and more limited in the range of merchandise than
a _h_y_p_e_r_m_a_r_k_e_t or _b_i_g_-_b_o_x_ _m_a_r_k_e_t.
The supermarket typically comprises _m_e_a_t, fresh _p_r_o_d_u_c_e, _d_a_i_r_y, and baked goods
aisles, along with shelf space reserved for canned and packaged goods as well
as for various non-food items such as kitchenware, household cleaners, pharmacy
products and _p_e_t supplies. Some supermarkets also sell a variety of other
household products that are consumed regularly, such as alcohol (where
permitted), _m_e_d_i_c_i_n_e, and _c_l_o_t_h_e_s, and some stores sell a much wider range of
non-food products: DVDs, sporting equipment, board games, and seasonal items
(e.g., Christmas wrapping paper in December).
The traditional supermarket occupies a large amount of floor space, usually on
a single level. It is usually situated near a residential area in order to be
convenient to consumers. The basic appeal is the availability of a broad
selection of goods under a single roof, at relatively low prices. Other
advantages include ease of parking and frequently the convenience of shopping
hours that extend into the evening or even 24 hours a day. Supermarkets usually
allocate large budgets to advertising, typically through newspapers. They also
present elaborate in-shop displays of products. The shops are usually part of
corporate _c_h_a_i_n_s that own or control (sometimes by _f_r_a_n_c_h_i_s_e) other
supermarkets located nearby‚Äîeven transnationally‚Äîthus increasing
opportunities for _e_c_o_n_o_m_i_e_s_ _o_f_ _s_c_a_l_e.
Supermarkets typically are supplied by the _d_i_s_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_o_n_ _c_e_n_t_r_e_s of their _p_a_r_e_n_t
_c_o_m_p_a_n_i_e_s, usually in the largest city in the area. Supermarkets usually offer
products at relatively low prices by using their buying power to buy goods from
manufacturers at lower prices than smaller stores can. They also minimise
financing costs by paying for goods at least 30 days after receipt and some
extract credit terms of 90 days or more from vendors. Certain products
(typically _s_t_a_p_l_e_ _f_o_o_d_s such as _b_r_e_a_d, _m_i_l_k and _s_u_g_a_r) are very occasionally
sold as _l_o_s_s_ _l_e_a_d_e_r_s, that is, with negative _p_r_o_f_i_t_ _m_a_r_g_i_n_s so as to attract
shoppers to their store. There is some debate as to the effectiveness of this
tactic. To maintain a _p_r_o_f_i_t, supermarkets make up for the lower margins by a
higher overall volume of sales, and with the sale of higher-margin items bought
by the intended higher volume of shoppers. Customers usually shop by placing
their selected merchandise into _s_h_o_p_p_i_n_g_ _c_a_r_t_s (trolleys) or baskets (self-
service) and pay for the merchandise at the _c_h_e_c_k_-_o_u_t. At present, many
supermarket chains are attempting to further reduce _l_a_b_o_r_ _c_o_s_t_s by shifting to
_s_e_l_f_-_s_e_r_v_i_c_e_ _c_h_e_c_k_-_o_u_t machines, where a single employee can oversee a group of
four or five machines at once, assisting multiple customers at a time.
A larger full-service supermarket combined with a _d_e_p_a_r_t_m_e_n_t_ _s_t_o_r_e is sometimes
known as a _h_y_p_e_r_m_a_r_k_e_t. Other services offered at some supermarkets may include
those of _b_a_n_k_s, _c_a_f_√_©_s, _c_h_i_l_d_c_a_r_e_ _c_e_n_t_r_e_s_/_c_r_e_c_h_e_s, _p_h_o_t_o_ _p_r_o_c_e_s_s_i_n_g, _v_i_d_e_o

A supermarket in Sweden in 1941
Consumers shopping for fresh produce and fruit.
In the early days of retailing, all products generally were fetched by an
assistant from shelves behind the merchant's counter while customers waited in
front of the counter and indicated the items they wanted. Also, most foods and
merchandise did not come in individually wrapped consumer-sized packages, so an
assistant had to measure out and wrap the precise amount desired by the
consumer. This also offered opportunities for social interaction: many regarded
this style of shopping as "a social occasion" and would often "pause for
conversations with the staff or other customers."_[_1_] These practices were by
nature very _l_a_b_o_r_-_i_n_t_e_n_s_i_v_e and therefore also quite expensive. The shopping
process was slow, as the number of customers who could be attended to at one
time was limited by the number of staff employed in the store.
The concept of an inexpensive food market relying on large economies of scale
was developed by _V_i_n_c_e_n_t_ _A_s_t_o_r. He founded the Astor Market in 1915, investing
$750,000 of his fortune into a 165' by 125' corner of 95th and Broadway,
_M_a_n_h_a_t_t_a_n, creating, in effect, an open air mini-mall that sold meat, fruit,
produce and _f_l_o_w_e_r_s. The expectation was that customers would come from great
distances ("miles around"), but in the end even attracting people from ten
blocks away was difficult, and the market folded in 1917._[_2_]_[_3_]_[_4_]
The concept of a self-service grocery store was developed by _e_n_t_r_e_p_r_e_n_e_u_r
_C_l_a_r_e_n_c_e_ _S_a_u_n_d_e_r_s and his _P_i_g_g_l_y_ _W_i_g_g_l_y stores. His first store opened in 1916.
Saunders was awarded a number of _p_a_t_e_n_t_s for the ideas he incorporated into his
stores._[_5_]_[_6_]_[_7_]_[_8_] The stores were a financial success and Saunders began to
offer franchises. _T_h_e_ _G_r_e_a_t_ _A_t_l_a_n_t_i_c_ _&_ _P_a_c_i_f_i_c_ _T_e_a_ _C_o_m_p_a_n_y, which was
established in 1859, was another successful early grocery store chain in _C_a_n_a_d_a
and the United States, and became common in North American cities in the 1920s.
The general trend in retail since then has been to stock shelves at night so
that customers, the following day, can obtain their own goods and bring them to
the front of the store to pay for them. Although there is a higher risk of
_s_h_o_p_l_i_f_t_i_n_g, the costs of appropriate security measures ideally will be
outweighed by reduced labor costs.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]
Early self-service grocery stores did not sell fresh meats or produce.
Combination stores that sold perishable items were developed in the 1920s._[_9_]
Historically, there was debate about the origin of the supermarket, with King
Kullen and _R_a_l_p_h_'_s of _C_a_l_i_f_o_r_n_i_a having strong claims._[_1_0_] Other contenders
included Weingarten's Big Food Markets and Henke & Pillot._[_1_1_] To end the
debate, the _F_o_o_d_ _M_a_r_k_e_t_i_n_g_ _I_n_s_t_i_t_u_t_e in conjunction with the _S_m_i_t_h_s_o_n_i_a_n
_I_n_s_t_i_t_u_t_i_o_n and with funding from _H_._J_._ _H_e_i_n_z, researched the issue. It defined
the attributes of a supermarket as "self-service, separate product departments,
discount pricing, marketing and volume selling."[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]
It has been determined that the first true supermarket in the United States was
opened by a former _K_r_o_g_e_r employee, _M_i_c_h_a_e_l_ _J_._ _C_u_l_l_e_n, on August 4, 1930,
inside a 6,000-square-foot (560 m2) former garage in _J_a_m_a_i_c_a_,_ _Q_u_e_e_n_s in _N_e_w
_Y_o_r_k_ _C_i_t_y._[_1_2_] The store, _K_i_n_g_ _K_u_l_l_e_n, (inspired by the fictional character
_K_i_n_g_ _K_o_n_g), operated under the slogan "Pile it high. Sell it low." At the time
of Cullen's death in 1936, there were seventeen King Kullen stores in
operation. Although Saunders had brought the world self-service, uniform stores
and nationwide marketing, Cullen built on this idea by adding separate food
departments, selling large volumes of food at discount prices and adding a
parking lot.
A _S_a_f_e_w_a_y advertisement from the 1950s
Other established American grocery chains in the 1930s, such as Kroger and
_S_a_f_e_w_a_y at first resisted Cullen's idea, but eventually were forced to build
their own supermarkets as the economy sank into the _G_r_e_a_t_ _D_e_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n, while
consumers were becoming price-sensitive at a level never experienced before.
_[_1_3_] Kroger took the idea one step further and pioneered the first supermarket
surrounded on all four sides by a _p_a_r_k_i_n_g_ _l_o_t.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]
Supermarkets proliferated across Canada and the United States with the growth
of automobile ownership and _s_u_b_u_r_b_a_n_ _d_e_v_e_l_o_p_m_e_n_t after _W_o_r_l_d_ _W_a_r_ _I_I. Most North
American supermarkets are located in suburban _s_t_r_i_p_ _s_h_o_p_p_i_n_g_ _c_e_n_t_e_r_s as an
anchor store along with other smaller retailers. They are generally regional
rather than national in their company _b_r_a_n_d_i_n_g. Kroger is perhaps the most
nationally oriented supermarket chain in the United States but it has preserved
most of its regional brands, including _R_a_l_p_h_s, _C_i_t_y_ _M_a_r_k_e_t, _K_i_n_g_ _S_o_o_p_e_r_s,
_F_r_y_'_s, _S_m_i_t_h_'_s, and _Q_F_C.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]
In Canada, the largest such chain is _L_o_b_l_a_w, which operates stores under a
variety of regional names, including _F_o_r_t_i_n_o_s, _Z_e_h_r_s, _N_o_ _F_r_i_l_l_s, the Real
Canadian Superstore, and the largest, _L_o_b_l_a_w_s, (named after the company
itself). _S_o_b_e_y_s is Canada's second largest supermarket with locations across
the country, operating under many banners (Sobeys IGA in _Q_u_e_b_e_c).[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n
_n_e_e_d_e_d] Qu√©bec's first supermarket opened in 1934 in Montr√©al, under the
banner _S_t_e_i_n_b_e_r_g_'_s._[_1_4_]
In the United Kingdom, self-service shopping took longer to become established.
Even in 1947, there were just ten self-service shops in the country._[_1_] In
1951, ex-_U_S_ _N_a_v_y sailor Patrick Galvani, son-in-law of _E_x_p_r_e_s_s_ _D_a_i_r_i_e_s
chairman, made a pitch to the board to open a chain of supermarkets across the
country. The UK's first supermarket under the new _P_r_e_m_i_e_r_ _S_u_p_e_r_m_a_r_k_e_t_s brand
opened in _S_t_r_e_a_t_h_a_m, _S_o_u_t_h_ _L_o_n_d_o_n,_[_1_5_] taking ten times as much per week as the
average British general store of the time. Other chains caught on, and after
Galvani lost out to Tesco's _J_a_c_k_ _C_o_h_e_n in 1960 to buy the 212 Irwin's chain,
the sector underwent a large amount of consolidation, resulting in 'the big
four' dominant UK retailers of today: _T_e_s_c_o, _A_s_d_a (owned by _W_a_l_-_M_a_r_t),
_S_a_i_n_s_b_u_r_y_'_s and _M_o_r_r_i_s_o_n_s.
In the 1950s, supermarkets frequently issued _t_r_a_d_i_n_g_ _s_t_a_m_p_s as incentives to
customers. Today, most chains issue store-specific "membership cards," "club
cards," or "_l_o_y_a_l_t_y_ _c_a_r_d_s". These typically enable the card holder to receive
special members-only discounts on certain items when the credit card-like
device is scanned at check-out.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]. Sales of selected data
generated by clubcards is becoming a significant revenue stream for some
supermarkets.
Traditional supermarkets in many countries face intense competition from
_d_i_s_c_o_u_n_t_ _r_e_t_a_i_l_e_r_s such as Wal-Mart, and _T_e_s_c_o in the UK, which typically are
non-_u_n_i_o_n and operate with better buying power. Other competition exists from
_w_a_r_e_h_o_u_s_e_ _c_l_u_b_s such as _C_o_s_t_c_o that offer savings to customers buying in bulk
quantities. _S_u_p_e_r_s_t_o_r_e_s, such as those operated by _W_a_l_-_M_a_r_t and Asda, often
offer a wide range of goods and services in addition to foods. The
proliferation of such warehouse and superstores has contributed to the
continuing disappearance of smaller, local grocery stores; increased dependence
on the _a_u_t_o_m_o_b_i_l_e; suburban sprawl because of the necessity for large
floorspace and increased vehicular traffic. Some critics consider the chains'
common practice of selling loss leaders to be anti-competitive. They are also
wary of the negotiating power that large, often _m_u_l_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n_a_l retailers have
with suppliers around the world.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]

There has been a rapid transformation of the food retail sector in developing
countries, beginning in the 1990s. This applies particularly to Latin America,
South-East Asia, China and South Africa. However, growth is being witnessed in
nearly all countries. With growth, has come considerable competition and some
amount of consolidation._[_1_6_] The growth has been driven by increasing affluence
and the rise of a middle class; the entry of women into the workforce; with a
consequent incentive to seek out easy-to-prepare foods; the growth in the use
of refrigerators, making it possible to shop weekly instead of daily; and the
growth in car ownership, facilitating journeys to distant stores and purchases
of large quantities of goods. The opportunities presented by this potential
have encouraged several European companies to invest in these markets (mainly
in Asia) and American companies to invest in Latin America and China. Local
companies also entered the market._[_1_7_] Initial development of supermarkets has
now been followed by hypermarket growth. In addition there were investments by
companies such as _M_a_k_r_o and _M_e_t_r_o in large-scale _C_a_s_h_-_a_n_d_-_C_a_r_r_y operations.
While the growth in sales of processed foods in these countries has been much
more rapid than the growth in fresh food sales, the imperative nature of
supermarkets to achieve economies of scale in purchasing, means that the
expansion of supermarkets in these countries has important repercussions for
small farmers, particularly those growing perishable crops. New supply chains
have developed involving _c_l_u_s_t_e_r formation; development of specialized
wholesalers; leading farmers organizing supply; and farmer associations or
cooperatives._[_1_8_] In some cases supermarkets have organized their own
procurement from small farmers; in others _w_h_o_l_e_s_a_l_e_ _m_a_r_k_e_t_s have adapted to
meet supermarket needs._[_1_9_]

While branding and store advertising will differ from company to company, the
layout of a supermarket remains virtually unchanged. Although big companies
spend time giving consumers a pleasant shopping experience, the design of a
supermarket is directly connected to the in-store marketing that supermarkets
must conduct in order to get shoppers to spend more money while there.
Every aspect of the store is mapped out and attention is paid to colour,
wording and even surface texture. The overall layout of a supermarket is a
visual merchandising project that plays a major role in retailing. Stores can
creatively use a layout to alter customers‚Äô perceptions of the atmosphere.
Alternatively, they can enhance the store‚Äôs atmospherics through visual
communications (signs and graphics), lighting, colours, and even scents._[_2_0_]
For example, to give a sense of the supermarket being healthy, fresh produce is
deliberately located at the front of the store. In terms of bakery items,
su¬≠permarkets usually dedicate 30 to 40 feet of store space to the bread
aisle._[_2_1_]
Supermarkets are designed to
     "give each product section a sense of individual difference and this
     is evident in the design of what are called the anchor departments;
     fresh produce, dairy, delicatessen, meat and the bakery"
._[_2_2_] Each section has different floor coverings, style, lighting and sometimes
even individual services counters to allow shoppers to feel as if there are a
number of markets within this one supermarket._[_2_3_]

Marketers use well researched techniques to try control purchasing behaviour.
The layout of a supermarket is considered by some to consist of a few rules of
thumb and three layout principles._[_2_4_] The high draw products are placed in
separate areas of the store to keep drawing the consumer through the store.
High impulse and high margin products are placed in the most predominant areas
to grab attention. Power products are placed on both sides of the aisle to
create increased product awareness, and end caps are used to receive high
exposure of a certain product whether on special, promotion or in a campaign,
or a new line.
The first principle of layout is circulation. Circulation is created by
arranging product so the supermarket can control the traffic flow of the
consumer. Along this path there will be high-draw, high-impulse items that will
influence the consumer to purchase which he or she did not intend to. Service
areas such as rest rooms are placed in a location which draws the consumer past
certain products to create extra buys. Necessity items such as bread, milk are
found at the rear of the store to increase the start of circulation.
Cashier‚Äôs desks are placed in a position to promote circulation. The entrance
will be on the right hand side because research has shown that consumers who
travel in a clockwise direction spend more (Browne, p. 60).
The second principle of layout is coordination. Coordination is the organised
arrangement of product that promotes sales. Products such as fast-selling and
slow-selling lines are placed in strategic positions in aid of the overall
sales plan. Managers sometimes place different items in fast selling places to
increase turnover or to promote a new line.
The third principle is consumer convenience. The layout of a supermarket is
designed to create a high degree of convenience to the consumer to make the
shopping experience pleasant. This is done through the character of
merchandising and product placement. There are many different ideas and
theories in relation to layout and how product layout can influence the
purchases made.
One theory_[_2_5_] suggests that certain products are placed together or near one
another that are of a similar or complementary nature to increase the average
customer spend. This strategy is used by retailers to create ‚Äòcross-category
sales similarity. In other words, the tooth paste is next to or adjacent the
tooth brushes and the tea and coffee are down the same isle as the sweet
biscuits. These products complement one another and placing them near is one
way marketers try to increase purchases._[_2_5_]
Consumer psychologists suggest that most buyers tend to enter the store and
shop to their right first._[_2_6_] suggests supermarket marketers use this theory
to their advantage by placing their temporary displays of products on the right
hand side to entice you to make an un-planned purchase. Furthermore aisle ends
are extremely popular with product manufacturers, who pay top dollar to have
their products located there (Browne, 2010). These isle ends are used as major
draw cards to lure customers into making a snap purchase and to also entice
them to shop down the isle. The most obvious place supermarket layout has an
impact on consumers is at the checkout. Small displays of chocolates, magazines
and drinks are located at each checkout to tempt shoppers while they wait to be
served._[_2_6_]

    * Supermarket, in general, tend to narrow the choices of fruits and

    * Supermarkets often generate a lot of _f_o_o_d_ _w_a_s_t_e.
    * Supermarkets can generally retail at lower prices than traditional corner
      shops and markets due to higher volume throughput. This has led to small

      as an adverse effect on the local _i_n_f_r_a_s_t_r_u_c_t_u_r_e._[_2_7_]

      from suppliers in exchange for premium shelf space and/or better
      positioning (such as at eye-level, on the checkout aisle or at a shelf's
      "end cap"). This extra supplier cost (up to $30,000 per brand for a chain
      for each individual _S_K_U) may be reflected in the cost of the products
      offered. Some critics have questioned the ethical and legal propriety of
      slotting fee payments and their effect on smaller suppliers _[_2_] _[_3_] _[_4_].
