The world's effective capacity to exchange information through two-way
telecommunication networks grew from 281 _p_e_t_a_b_y_t_e_s of (optimally compressed)
information in 1986, to 471 petabytes in 1993, to 2.2 (optimally compressed)
_e_x_a_b_y_t_e_s in 2000, and to 65 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 2007._[_8_] This is
the informational equivalent of two newspaper pages per person per day in 1986,
and six entire newspapers per person per day by 2007._[_9_] Given this growth,
telecommunications play an increasingly important role in the world economy and
the global telecommunications industry was about a _$4.7 trillion sector in
2012._[_1_0_]_[_1_1_] The service revenue of the global telecommunications industry was
estimated to be $1.5 trillion in 2010, corresponding to 2.4% of the world‚Äôs

The word telecommunication was adapted from the Spanish word Telecom. It is a
compound of the Greek prefix tele- (œÑŒ∑ŒªŒµ-), meaning "far off", and the
Latin communicare, meaning "to share"._[_1_2_] The French word t√©l√©communication
was first invented in the French Grande Ecole "Telecom ParisTech" formerly
known as "Ecole nationale superieure des telecommunications" in 1904 by the
French engineer and novelist _√_â_d_o_u_a_r_d_ _E_s_t_a_u_n_i_√_©._[_1_3_]

signals, functioned as _o_p_t_i_c_a_l_ _t_e_l_e_g_r_a_p_h_s. However, they could only utilize a
very limited range of pre-determined messages, and as with all such optical
telegraphs could only be deployed during good visibility conditions._[_1_4_]
During the Middle Ages, chains of beacons were commonly used on hilltops as a
means of relaying a signal. Beacon chains suffered the drawback that they could
only pass a single bit of information, so the meaning of the message such as
"the enemy has been sighted" had to be agreed upon in advance. One notable
instance of their use was during the _S_p_a_n_i_s_h_ _A_r_m_a_d_a, when a beacon chain
relayed a signal from _P_l_y_m_o_u_t_h to London that signaled the arrival of the
Spanish warships._[_1_5_]

In 1792, Claude Chappe, a French engineer, built the first fixed visual
telegraphy system (or semaphore line) between _L_i_l_l_e and Paris._[_1_6_] However
semaphore systems suffered from the need for skilled operators, and expensive
towers at intervals of 10‚Äì30 kilometers (6‚Äì20 mi). As a result of
competition from the electrical telegraph, Europe's last commercial semaphore
line in Sweden was abandoned in 1880._[_1_7_]

A practical _e_l_e_c_t_r_i_c_a_l_ _t_e_l_e_g_r_a_p_h was proposed in January 1837 by _W_i_l_l_i_a_m
_F_o_t_h_e_r_g_i_l_l_ _C_o_o_k_e, who considered it an improvement on the existing

Early telegraphs used several wires connected to a number of indicator needles.
Businessman _S_a_m_u_e_l_ _F_._B_._ _M_o_r_s_e and physicist _J_o_s_e_p_h_ _H_e_n_r_y of the United States
developed their own, simpler version of the electrical telegraph,
independently. Morse successfully demonstrated this system on September 2,
1837. Morse's most important technical contribution to this telegraph was the
simple and highly efficient _M_o_r_s_e_ _C_o_d_e co-developed with his associate _A_l_f_r_e_d
_V_a_i_l, which was an important advance over Wheatstone's more complicated and
expensive system, and required just two wires. The communications efficiency of
the Morse Code preceded that of the _H_u_f_f_m_a_n_ _c_o_d_e in _d_i_g_i_t_a_l_ _c_o_m_m_u_n_i_c_a_t_i_o_n_s by
over 100 years, but Morse and Vail developed the code purely _e_m_p_i_r_i_c_a_l_l_y, with
shorter codes for more frequent letters.
The first permanent _t_r_a_n_s_a_t_l_a_n_t_i_c_ _t_e_l_e_g_r_a_p_h_ _c_a_b_l_e was successfully completed on
27 July 1866, allowing transatlantic electrical communication for the first
time._[_1_9_] An earlier transatlantic cable had operated for a few months in 1859,
and among other things, it carried messages of greeting back and forth between
_P_r_e_s_i_d_e_n_t _J_a_m_e_s_ _B_u_c_h_a_n_a_n of the United States and _Q_u_e_e_n_ _V_i_c_t_o_r_i_a of the United
Kingdom
However that first transatlantic cable soon failed, and the project to lay a
replacement line was delayed for five years by the _A_m_e_r_i_c_a_n_ _C_i_v_i_l_ _W_a_r. The
first transatlantic telephone cable (which incorporated hundreds of _e_l_e_c_t_r_o_n_i_c

of the telephone, from which all other patents for electric telephone devices
and features flowed. Credit for the invention of the electric telephone has
been frequently disputed, and new controversies over the issue have arisen from
time-to-time. As with other great inventions such as radio, television, the
light bulb, and the _d_i_g_i_t_a_l_ _c_o_m_p_u_t_e_r, there were several inventors who did
pioneering experimental work on voice transmission over a wire, who then
improved on each other's ideas. However, the key innovators were Alexander

over $500M.
The development of _v_i_d_e_o_t_e_l_e_p_h_o_n_y involved the historical development of
several technologies which enabled the use of live _v_i_d_e_o in addition to voice
telecommunications. The concept of videotelephony was first popularized in the
late 1870s in both the United States and Europe, although the basic sciences to
permit its very earliest trials would take nearly a half century to be
discovered. This was first embodied in the device which came to be known as the
_v_i_d_e_o_ _t_e_l_e_p_h_o_n_e, or videophone, and it evolved from intensive research and
experimentation in several telecommunication fields, notably _e_l_e_c_t_r_i_c_a_l
_t_e_l_e_g_r_a_p_h_y, _t_e_l_e_p_h_o_n_y, _r_a_d_i_o, and television.
The development of the crucial video technology first started in the latter
half of the 1920s in the United Kingdom and the United States, spurred notably
by John Logie Baird and _A_T_&_T_'_s_ _B_e_l_l_ _L_a_b_s. This occurred in part, at least by
AT&T, to serve as an adjunct supplementing the use of the telephone. A number
of organizations believed that videotelephony would be superior to plain voice
communications. However video technology was to be deployed in _a_n_a_l_o_g
_t_e_l_e_v_i_s_i_o_n_ _b_r_o_a_d_c_a_s_t_i_n_g long before it could become practical‚Äîor
popular‚Äîfor videophones.
Videotelephony developed in parallel with conventional _v_o_i_c_e_ _t_e_l_e_p_h_o_n_e_ _s_y_s_t_e_m_s
from the mid-to-late 20th century. Only in the late 20th century with the
advent of powerful _v_i_d_e_o_ _c_o_d_e_c_s and _h_i_g_h_-_s_p_e_e_d_ _b_r_o_a_d_b_a_n_d did it become a
practical technology for regular use. With the rapid improvements and
popularity of the Internet, it became widespread thru the use of
_v_i_d_e_o_c_o_n_f_e_r_e_n_c_i_n_g and _w_e_b_c_a_m_s, which frequently utilize _I_n_t_e_r_n_e_t_ _t_e_l_e_p_h_o_n_y, and
in business, where _t_e_l_e_p_r_e_s_e_n_c_e_ _t_e_c_h_n_o_l_o_g_y has helped reduce the need to
travel.

_c_o_m_m_u_n_i_c_a_t_i_o_n_s_ _c_a_b_l_e_s, through the use of _f_i_b_e_r_-_o_p_t_i_c_s, caused some decline in
the use of satellites for fixed telephony in the late 20th century, but they
still exclusively service remote islands such as _A_s_c_e_n_s_i_o_n_ _I_s_l_a_n_d, _S_a_i_n_t

service. There are also some continents and some regions of countries where
landline telecommunications are rare to nonexistent, for example _A_n_t_a_r_c_t_i_c_a,
plus large regions of _A_u_s_t_r_a_l_i_a, _S_o_u_t_h_ _A_m_e_r_i_c_a, _A_f_r_i_c_a, _N_o_r_t_h_e_r_n_ _C_a_n_a_d_a, _C_h_i_n_a,

After commercial long distance telephone service was established via
communication satellites, a host of other commercial telecommunications were
also adapted to similar satellites starting in 1979, including _m_o_b_i_l_e_ _s_a_t_e_l_l_i_t_e

_s_w_i_t_c_h_i_n_g ‚Äî a technology that allows chunks of data to be sent between

ARPANET's development centred around the Request for Comment process and on 7
April 1969, _R_F_C_ _1 was published. This process is important because ARPANET
would eventually merge with other networks to form the Internet, and many of

A number of key concepts reoccur throughout the literature on modern
telecommunication systems. Some of these concepts are discussed below.

A basic _t_e_l_e_c_o_m_m_u_n_i_c_a_t_i_o_n_ _s_y_s_t_e_m consists of three primary units that are
always present in some form:
    * A _t_r_a_n_s_m_i_t_t_e_r that takes information and converts it to a _s_i_g_n_a_l.
    * A _t_r_a_n_s_m_i_s_s_i_o_n_ _m_e_d_i_u_m, also called the "physical channel" that carries
      the signal. An example of this is the _"_f_r_e_e_ _s_p_a_c_e_ _c_h_a_n_n_e_l_".
    * A _r_e_c_e_i_v_e_r that takes the signal from the channel and converts it back
      into usable information.
For example, in a _r_a_d_i_o_ _b_r_o_a_d_c_a_s_t_i_n_g_ _s_t_a_t_i_o_n the station's large _p_o_w_e_r
_a_m_p_l_i_f_i_e_r is the transmitter; and the broadcasting _a_n_t_e_n_n_a is the interface
between the power amplifier and the "free space channel". The free space
channel is the transmission medium; and the receiver's antenna is the interface
between the free space channel and the receiver. Next, the _r_a_d_i_o_ _r_e_c_e_i_v_e_r is
the destination of the radio signal, and this is where it is converted from
electricity to sound for people to listen to.
Sometimes, telecommunication systems are _"_d_u_p_l_e_x_" (two-way systems) with a
single box of _e_l_e_c_t_r_o_n_i_c_s working as both a transmitter and a receiver, or a
transceiver. For example, a _c_e_l_l_u_l_a_r_ _t_e_l_e_p_h_o_n_e is a transceiver._[_3_6_] The
transmission electronics and the receiver electronics in a transceiver are
actually quite independent of each other. This can be readily explained by the
fact that radio transmitters contain power amplifiers that operate with
electrical powers measured in the _w_a_t_t_s or _k_i_l_o_w_a_t_t_s, but radio receivers deal
with radio powers that are measured in the _m_i_c_r_o_w_a_t_t_s or _n_a_n_o_w_a_t_t_s. Hence,
transceivers have to be carefully designed and built to isolate their high-
power circuitry and their low-power circuitry from each other.
Telecommunication over fixed lines is called _p_o_i_n_t_-_t_o_-_p_o_i_n_t_ _c_o_m_m_u_n_i_c_a_t_i_o_n
because it is between one transmitter and one receiver. Telecommunication
through radio broadcasts is called _b_r_o_a_d_c_a_s_t_ _c_o_m_m_u_n_i_c_a_t_i_o_n because it is
between one powerful transmitter and numerous low-power but sensitive radio
receivers._[_3_6_]
Telecommunications in which multiple transmitters and multiple receivers have
been designed to cooperate and to share the same physical channel are called
_m_u_l_t_i_p_l_e_x_ _s_y_s_t_e_m_s. The sharing of physical channels using multiplexing often
gives very large reductions in costs. Multiplexed systems are laid out in
telecommunication networks, and the multiplexed signals are switched at nodes
through to the correct destination terminal receiver.

Communications signals can be either by _a_n_a_l_o_g_ _s_i_g_n_a_l_s or _d_i_g_i_t_a_l_ _s_i_g_n_a_l_s.
There are _a_n_a_l_o_g_ _c_o_m_m_u_n_i_c_a_t_i_o_n systems and _d_i_g_i_t_a_l_ _c_o_m_m_u_n_i_c_a_t_i_o_n systems. For
an analog signal, the signal is varied continuously with respect to the
information. In a digital signal, the information is encoded as a set of
discrete values (for example, a set of ones and zeros). During the propagation
and reception, the information contained in analog signals will inevitably be
degraded by _u_n_d_e_s_i_r_a_b_l_e_ _p_h_y_s_i_c_a_l_ _n_o_i_s_e. (The output of a transmitter is noise-
free for all practical purposes.) Commonly, the noise in a communication system
can be expressed as adding or subtracting from the desirable signal in a
completely _r_a_n_d_o_m_ _w_a_y. This form of noise is called _a_d_d_i_t_i_v_e_ _n_o_i_s_e, with the
understanding that the noise can be negative or positive at different instants
of time. Noise that is not additive noise is a much more difficult situation to
describe or analyze, and these other kinds of noise will be omitted here.
On the other hand, unless the additive noise disturbance exceeds a certain
threshold, the information contained in digital signals will remain intact.
Their resistance to noise represents a key advantage of digital signals over
analog signals._[_3_7_]

communications networks contain one or more _r_o_u_t_e_r_s that work together to
transmit information to the correct user. An analog communications network
consists of one or more _s_w_i_t_c_h_e_s that establish a connection between two or
more users. For both types of network, _r_e_p_e_a_t_e_r_s may be necessary to amplify or
recreate the signal when it is being transmitted over long distances. This is
to combat _a_t_t_e_n_u_a_t_i_o_n that can render the signal indistinguishable from the
noise._[_3_8_] Another advantage of digital systems over analog is that their
output is easier to store in memory.i.e. two voltage states (high and low) are
easier to store than a continuous range of states.

The term "channel" has two different meanings. In one meaning, a channel is the
physical medium that carries a signal between the transmitter and the receiver.
Examples of this include the _a_t_m_o_s_p_h_e_r_e for sound communications, glass _o_p_t_i_c_a_l
_f_i_b_e_r_s for some kinds of _o_p_t_i_c_a_l_ _c_o_m_m_u_n_i_c_a_t_i_o_n_s, _c_o_a_x_i_a_l_ _c_a_b_l_e_s for
communications by way of the voltages and electric currents in them, and _f_r_e_e
_s_p_a_c_e for communications using _v_i_s_i_b_l_e_ _l_i_g_h_t, _i_n_f_r_a_r_e_d_ _w_a_v_e_s, _u_l_t_r_a_v_i_o_l_e_t
_l_i_g_h_t, and _r_a_d_i_o_ _w_a_v_e_s. This last channel is called the "free space channel".
The sending of radio waves from one place to another has nothing to do with the
presence or absence of an atmosphere between the two. Radio waves travel
through a perfect _v_a_c_u_u_m just as easily as they travel through air, fog,
clouds, or any other kind of gas besides air.
The other meaning of the term "channel" in telecommunications is seen in the
phrase _c_o_m_m_u_n_i_c_a_t_i_o_n_s_ _c_h_a_n_n_e_l, which is a subdivision of a transmission medium
so that it can be used to send multiple streams of information simultaneously.
For example, one radio station can broadcast radio waves into free space at
frequencies in the neighborhood of 94.5 _M_H_z (megahertz) while another radio
station can simultaneously broadcast radio waves at frequencies in the
neighborhood of 96.1 MHz. Each radio station would transmit radio waves over a
frequency _b_a_n_d_w_i_d_t_h of about 180 _k_H_z (kilohertz), centered at frequencies such
as the above, which are called the _"_c_a_r_r_i_e_r_ _f_r_e_q_u_e_n_c_i_e_s_". Each station in this
example is separated from its adjacent stations by 200 kHz, and the difference
between 200 kHz and 180 kHz (20 kHz) is an engineering allowance for the
imperfections in the communication system.
In the example above, the "free space channel" has been divided into
communications channels according to _f_r_e_q_u_e_n_c_i_e_s, and each channel is assigned
a separate frequency bandwidth in which to broadcast radio waves. This system
of dividing the medium into channels according to frequency is called
"_f_r_e_q_u_e_n_c_y_-_d_i_v_i_s_i_o_n_ _m_u_l_t_i_p_l_e_x_i_n_g" (FFDDMM).
Another way of dividing a communications medium into channels is to allocate
each sender a recurring segment of time (a "time slot", for example, 20
_m_i_l_l_i_s_e_c_o_n_d_s out of each second), and to allow each sender to send messages
only within its own time slot. This method of dividing the medium into
communication channels is called "_t_i_m_e_-_d_i_v_i_s_i_o_n_ _m_u_l_t_i_p_l_e_x_i_n_g" (TTDDMM), and is
used in optical fiber communication. Some radio communication systems use TDM
within an allocated FDM channel. Hence, these systems use a hybrid of TDM and
FDM.

The shaping of a signal to convey information is known as _m_o_d_u_l_a_t_i_o_n.
Modulation can be used to represent a digital message as an analog waveform.
This is commonly called _"_k_e_y_i_n_g_" ‚Äì a term derived from the older use of Morse
Code in telecommunications ‚Äì and several keying techniques exist (these
include _p_h_a_s_e_-_s_h_i_f_t_ _k_e_y_i_n_g, _f_r_e_q_u_e_n_c_y_-_s_h_i_f_t_ _k_e_y_i_n_g, and _a_m_p_l_i_t_u_d_e_-_s_h_i_f_t
_k_e_y_i_n_g). The "_B_l_u_e_t_o_o_t_h" system, for example, uses phase-shift keying to
exchange information between various devices._[_3_9_]_[_4_0_] In addition, there are
combinations of phase-shift keying and amplitude-shift keying which is called
(in the jargon of the field) "_q_u_a_d_r_a_t_u_r_e_ _a_m_p_l_i_t_u_d_e_ _m_o_d_u_l_a_t_i_o_n" (QAM) that are
used in high-capacity digital radio communication systems.
Modulation can also be used to transmit the information of low-frequency analog
signals at higher frequencies. This is helpful because low-frequency analog
signals cannot be effectively transmitted over free space. Hence the
information from a low-frequency analog signal must be impressed into a higher-
frequency signal (known as the "_c_a_r_r_i_e_r_ _w_a_v_e") before transmission. There are
several different modulation schemes available to achieve this [two of the most
basic being _a_m_p_l_i_t_u_d_e_ _m_o_d_u_l_a_t_i_o_n (AM) and _f_r_e_q_u_e_n_c_y_ _m_o_d_u_l_a_t_i_o_n (FM)]. An
example of this process is a disc jockey's voice being impressed into a 96 MHz
carrier wave using frequency modulation (the voice would then be received on a
radio as the channel "96 FM")._[_4_1_] In addition, modulation has the advantage of
being about to use frequency division multiplexing (FDM)

On the microeconomic scale, companies have used telecommunications to help
build global business empires. This is self-evident in the case of online
retailer _A_m_a_z_o_n_._c_o_m but, according to academic Edward Lenert, even the
conventional retailer _W_a_l_-_M_a_r_t has benefited from better telecommunication
infrastructure compared to its competitors._[_4_2_] In cities throughout the world,
home owners use their telephones to order and arrange a variety of home
services ranging from pizza deliveries to electricians. Even relatively poor
communities have been noted to use telecommunication to their advantage. In
_B_a_n_g_l_a_d_e_s_h's Narshingdi district, isolated villagers use cellular phones to
speak directly to wholesalers and arrange a better price for their goods. In

On the macroeconomic scale, Lars-Hendrik R√∂ller and _L_e_o_n_a_r_d_ _W_a_v_e_r_m_a_n suggested
a causal link between good telecommunication infrastructure and economic
growth._[_4_4_] Few dispute the existence of a correlation although some argue it
is wrong to view the relationship as causal._[_4_5_]
Because of the economic benefits of good telecommunication infrastructure,
there is increasing worry about the inequitable access to telecommunication
services amongst various countries of the world‚Äîthis is known as the _d_i_g_i_t_a_l
_d_i_v_i_d_e. A 2003 survey by the _I_n_t_e_r_n_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _T_e_l_e_c_o_m_m_u_n_i_c_a_t_i_o_n_ _U_n_i_o_n (ITU)
revealed that roughly a third of countries have fewer than one mobile

land-line telephone subscription for every 20 people. In terms of Internet
access, roughly half of all countries have fewer than one out of 20 people with
Internet access. From this information, as well as educational data, the ITU
was able to compile an index that measures the overall ability of citizens to
access and use information and communication technologies._[_4_6_] Using this

Telecommunication has played a significant role in social relationships.
Nevertheless devices like the telephone system were originally advertised with
an emphasis on the practical dimensions of the device (such as the ability to
conduct business or order home services) as opposed to the social dimensions.
It was not until the late 1920s and 1930s that the social dimensions of the
device became a prominent theme in telephone advertisements. New promotions
started appealing to consumers' emotions, stressing the importance of social
conversations and staying connected to family and friends._[_4_8_]
Since then the role that telecommunications has played in social relations has
become increasingly important. In recent years, the popularity of _s_o_c_i_a_l
_n_e_t_w_o_r_k_i_n_g_ _s_i_t_e_s has increased dramatically. These sites allow users to
communicate with each other as well as post photographs, events and profiles
for others to see. The profiles can list a person's age, interests, sexual
preference and relationship status. In this way, these sites can play important
role in everything from organising social engagements to _c_o_u_r_t_s_h_i_p._[_4_9_]

In cultural terms, telecommunication has increased the public's ability to
access music and film. With television, people can watch films they have not
seen before in their own home without having to travel to the video store or
cinema. With radio and the Internet, people can listen to music they have not
heard before without having to travel to the music store.
Telecommunication has also transformed the way people receive their news. A
survey led in 2006 by the non-profit Pew Internet and American Life Project
found that when just over 3,000 people living in the United States were asked
where they got their news "yesterday", more people said television or radio
than newspapers. The results are summarised in the following table (the
percentages add up to more than 100% because people were able to specify more
than one source)._[_5_1_]

Many countries have enacted legislation which conforms to the International
Telecommunication Regulations established by the International
Telecommunication Union (ITU), which is the "leading UN agency for information
and communication technology issues."_[_5_3_] In 1947, at the Atlantic City
Conference, the ITU decided to "afford international protection to all
frequencies registered in a new international frequency list and used in
conformity with the Radio Regulation." According to the ITU's Radio Regulations
adopted in Atlantic City, all frequencies referenced in the International
Frequency Registration Board, examined by the board and registered on the
International Frequency List "shall have the right to international protection
from harmful interference."_[_5_4_]

broadcasting._[_5_5_] The onset of _W_o_r_l_d_ _W_a_r_ _I_I brought on the first explosion of
international broadcasting propaganda._[_5_5_] Countries, their governments,

political movements and colonization started the mid-1930s. In 1936, the BBC

_O_p_t_i_c_a_l_ _f_i_b_e_r provides cheaper bandwidth for long distance communication
In an analog telephone network, the caller is connected to the person he wants
to talk to by switches at various _t_e_l_e_p_h_o_n_e_ _e_x_c_h_a_n_g_e_s. The switches form an
electrical connection between the two users and the setting of these switches
is determined electronically when the caller _d_i_a_l_s the number. Once the
connection is made, the caller's voice is transformed to an electrical signal
using a small _m_i_c_r_o_p_h_o_n_e in the caller's _h_a_n_d_s_e_t. This electrical signal is
then sent through the network to the user at the other end where it is
transformed back into sound by a small _s_p_e_a_k_e_r in that person's handset. There
is a separate electrical connection that works in reverse, allowing the users
to converse._[_6_0_]_[_6_1_]
The landline telephones in most residential homes are analog‚Äîthat is, the
speaker's voice directly determines the signal's voltage. Although short-
distance calls may be handled from end-to-end as analog signals, increasingly
telephone service providers are transparently converting the signals to digital
for transmission before converting them back to analog for reception. The
advantage of this is that digitized voice data can travel side-by-side with
data from the Internet and can be perfectly reproduced in long distance
communication (as opposed to analog signals that are inevitably impacted by
noise).
Mobile phones have had a significant impact on telephone networks. Mobile phone
subscriptions now outnumber fixed-line subscriptions in many markets. Sales of
mobile phones in 2005 totalled 816.6 million with that figure being almost
equally shared amongst the markets of Asia/Pacific (204 m), Western Europe (164
m), CEMEA (Central Europe, the Middle East and Africa) (153.5 m), North America
(148 m) and Latin America (102 m)._[_6_2_] In terms of new subscriptions over the
five years from 1999, Africa has outpaced other markets with 58.2% growth._[_6_3_]
Increasingly these phones are being serviced by systems where the voice content
is transmitted digitally such as _G_S_M or _W_-_C_D_M_A with many markets choosing to
depreciate analog systems such as _A_M_P_S._[_6_4_]
There have also been dramatic changes in telephone communication behind the
scenes. Starting with the operation of _T_A_T_-_8 in 1988, the 1990s saw the
widespread adoption of systems based on optical fibers. The benefit of
communicating with optic fibers is that they offer a drastic increase in data
capacity. TAT-8 itself was able to carry 10 times as many telephone calls as
the last copper cable laid at that time and today's optic fibre cables are able
to carry 25 times as many telephone calls as TAT-8._[_6_5_] This increase in data
capacity is due to several factors: First, optic fibres are physically much
smaller than competing technologies. Second, they do not suffer from _c_r_o_s_s_t_a_l_k
which means several hundred of them can be easily bundled together in a single
cable._[_6_6_] Lastly, improvements in multiplexing have led to an exponential
growth in the data capacity of a single fibre._[_6_7_]_[_6_8_]
Assisting communication across many modern optic fibre networks is a protocol
known as _A_s_y_n_c_h_r_o_n_o_u_s_ _T_r_a_n_s_f_e_r_ _M_o_d_e (ATM). The ATM protocol allows for the
side-by-side data transmission mentioned in the second paragraph. It is
suitable for public telephone networks because it establishes a pathway for
data through the network and associates a _t_r_a_f_f_i_c_ _c_o_n_t_r_a_c_t with that pathway.
The traffic contract is essentially an agreement between the client and the
network about how the network is to handle the data; if the network cannot meet
the conditions of the traffic contract it does not accept the connection. This
is important because telephone calls can negotiate a contract so as to
guarantee themselves a constant bit rate, something that will ensure a caller's
voice is not delayed in parts or cut-off completely._[_6_9_] There are competitors
to ATM, such as _M_u_l_t_i_p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l_ _L_a_b_e_l_ _S_w_i_t_c_h_i_n_g (MPLS), that perform a similar
task and are expected to supplant ATM in the future._[_7_0_]_[_7_1_]

_D_i_g_i_t_a_l_ _t_e_l_e_v_i_s_i_o_n standards and their adoption worldwide.
In a broadcast system, the central high-powered _b_r_o_a_d_c_a_s_t_ _t_o_w_e_r transmits a
high-frequency _e_l_e_c_t_r_o_m_a_g_n_e_t_i_c_ _w_a_v_e to numerous low-powered receivers. The
high-frequency wave sent by the tower is modulated with a signal containing
visual or audio information. The receiver is then _t_u_n_e_d so as to pick up the
high-frequency wave and a _d_e_m_o_d_u_l_a_t_o_r is used to retrieve the signal containing
the visual or audio information. The broadcast signal can be either analog
(signal is varied continuously with respect to the information) or digital
(information is encoded as a set of discrete values)._[_3_6_]_[_7_2_]
The broadcast media industry is at a critical turning point in its development,
with many countries moving from analog to digital broadcasts. This move is made
possible by the production of cheaper, faster and more capable _i_n_t_e_g_r_a_t_e_d
_c_i_r_c_u_i_t_s. The chief advantage of digital broadcasts is that they prevent a
number of complaints common to traditional analog broadcasts. For television,
this includes the elimination of problems such as _s_n_o_w_y_ _p_i_c_t_u_r_e_s, _g_h_o_s_t_i_n_g and
other distortion. These occur because of the nature of analog transmission,
which means that perturbations due to noise will be evident in the final
output. Digital transmission overcomes this problem because digital signals are
reduced to discrete values upon reception and hence small perturbations do not
affect the final output. In a simplified example, if a binary message 1011 was
transmitted with signal amplitudes [1.0 0.0 1.0 1.0] and received with signal
amplitudes [0.9 0.2 1.1 0.9] it would still decode to the binary message 1011
‚Äî a perfect reproduction of what was sent. From this example, a problem with
digital transmissions can also be seen in that if the noise is great enough it
can significantly alter the decoded message. Using _f_o_r_w_a_r_d_ _e_r_r_o_r_ _c_o_r_r_e_c_t_i_o_n a
receiver can correct a handful of bit errors in the resulting message but too
much noise will lead to incomprehensible output and hence a breakdown of the
transmission._[_7_3_]_[_7_4_]
In digital television broadcasting, there are three competing standards that
are likely to be adopted worldwide. These are the _A_T_S_C, _D_V_B and _I_S_D_B standards;
the adoption of these standards thus far is presented in the captioned map. All
three standards use _M_P_E_G_-_2 for video compression. ATSC uses _D_o_l_b_y_ _D_i_g_i_t_a_l_ _A_C_-
_3 for audio compression, ISDB uses _A_d_v_a_n_c_e_d_ _A_u_d_i_o_ _C_o_d_i_n_g (MPEG-2 Part 7) and
DVB has no standard for audio compression but typically uses _M_P_E_G_-_1_ _P_a_r_t_ _3
_L_a_y_e_r_ _2._[_7_5_]_[_7_6_] The choice of modulation also varies between the schemes. In
digital audio broadcasting, standards are much more unified with practically
all countries choosing to adopt the _D_i_g_i_t_a_l_ _A_u_d_i_o_ _B_r_o_a_d_c_a_s_t_i_n_g standard (also
known as the _E_u_r_e_k_a_ _1_4_7 standard). The exception being the United States which
has chosen to adopt _H_D_ _R_a_d_i_o. HD Radio, unlike Eureka 147, is based upon a
transmission method known as _i_n_-_b_a_n_d_ _o_n_-_c_h_a_n_n_e_l transmission that allows
digital information to "piggyback" on normal AM or FM analog transmissions._[_7_7_]
However, despite the pending switch to digital, analog television remains being
transmitted in most countries. An exception is the United States that ended
analog television transmission (by all but the very low-power TV stations) on
12 June 2009_[_7_8_] after twice delaying the switchover deadline. For analog
television, there are three standards in use for broadcasting color TV (see a
map on adoption _h_e_r_e). These are known as _P_A_L (German designed), _N_T_S_C (North
American designed), and _S_E_C_A_M (French designed). (It is important to understand
that these are the ways from sending color TV, and they do not have anything to
do with the standards for black & white TV, which also vary from country to
country.) For analog radio, the switch to digital radio is made more difficult
by the fact that analog receivers are sold at a small fraction of the price of
digital receivers._[_7_9_]_[_8_0_] The choice of modulation for analog radio is
typically between amplitude (AAMM) or frequency modulation (FFMM). To achieve
_s_t_e_r_e_o_ _p_l_a_y_b_a_c_k, an amplitude modulated subcarrier is used for _s_t_e_r_e_o_ _F_M.

The Internet is a worldwide network of computers and computer networks that can

Internet is thus an exchange of messages between computers._[_8_2_]
It is estimated that the 51% of the information flowing through two-way
telecommunications networks in the year 2000 were flowing through the Internet
(most of the rest (42%) through the _l_a_n_d_l_i_n_e_ _t_e_l_e_p_h_o_n_e). By the year 2007 the
Internet clearly dominated and captured 97% of all the information in
telecommunication networks (most of the rest (2%) through _m_o_b_i_l_e_ _p_h_o_n_e_s)._[_8_] As
of 2008_[_u_p_d_a_t_e_], an estimated 21.9% of the world population has access to the
Internet with the highest access rates (measured as a percentage of the
population) in North America (73.6%), Oceania/Australia (59.5%) and Europe
(48.1%)._[_8_3_] In terms of _b_r_o_a_d_b_a_n_d_ _a_c_c_e_s_s, Iceland (26.7%), South Korea (25.4%)
and the Netherlands (25.3%) led the world._[_8_4_]
The Internet works in part because of _p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l_s that govern how the computers
and routers communicate with each other. The nature of computer network
communication lends itself to a layered approach where individual protocols in
the protocol stack run more-or-less independently of other protocols. This
allows lower-level protocols to be customized for the network situation while
not changing the way higher-level protocols operate. A practical example of why
this is important is because it allows an _I_n_t_e_r_n_e_t_ _b_r_o_w_s_e_r to run the same code
regardless of whether the computer it is running on is connected to the
Internet through an Ethernet or _W_i_-_F_i connection. Protocols are often talked
about in terms of their place in the OSI reference model (pictured on the
right), which emerged in 1983 as the first step in an unsuccessful attempt to
build a universally adopted networking protocol suite._[_8_5_]
For the Internet, the physical medium and data link protocol can vary several
times as packets traverse the globe. This is because the Internet places no
constraints on what physical medium or data link protocol is used. This leads
to the adoption of media and protocols that best suit the local network
situation. In practice, most intercontinental communication will use the
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) protocol (or a modern equivalent) on top of
optic fiber. This is because for most intercontinental communication the
Internet shares the same infrastructure as the public switched telephone
network.
At the network layer, things become standardized with the Internet Protocol
(IP) being adopted for _l_o_g_i_c_a_l_ _a_d_d_r_e_s_s_i_n_g. For the World Wide Web, these "IP
addresses" are derived from the human readable form using the _D_o_m_a_i_n_ _N_a_m_e
_S_y_s_t_e_m (e.g. _7_2_._1_4_._2_0_7_._9_9 is derived from _w_w_w_._g_o_o_g_l_e_._c_o_m). At the moment, the
most widely used version of the Internet Protocol is version four but a move to
version six is imminent._[_8_6_]
At the transport layer, most communication adopts either the Transmission
Control Protocol (TCP) or the _U_s_e_r_ _D_a_t_a_g_r_a_m_ _P_r_o_t_o_c_o_l (UDP). TCP is used when it
is essential every message sent is received by the other computer whereas UDP
is used when it is merely desirable. With TCP, packets are retransmitted if
they are lost and placed in order before they are presented to higher layers.
With UDP, packets are not ordered or retransmitted if lost. Both TCP and UDP
packets carry _p_o_r_t_ _n_u_m_b_e_r_s with them to specify what application or _p_r_o_c_e_s_s the
packet should be handled by._[_8_7_] Because certain application-level protocols
use _c_e_r_t_a_i_n_ _p_o_r_t_s, network administrators can manipulate traffic to suit
particular requirements. Examples are to restrict Internet access by blocking
the traffic destined for a particular port or to affect the performance of
certain applications by assigning _p_r_i_o_r_i_t_y.
Above the transport layer, there are certain protocols that are sometimes used
and loosely fit in the session and presentation layers, most notably the _S_e_c_u_r_e
_S_o_c_k_e_t_s_ _L_a_y_e_r (SSL) and _T_r_a_n_s_p_o_r_t_ _L_a_y_e_r_ _S_e_c_u_r_i_t_y (TLS) protocols. These
protocols ensure that data transferred between two parties remains completely
confidential._[_8_8_] Finally, at the application layer, are many of the protocols
Internet users would be familiar with such as _H_T_T_P (web browsing), _P_O_P_3 (e-
mail), _F_T_P (file transfer), _I_R_C (Internet chat), _B_i_t_T_o_r_r_e_n_t (file sharing) and
_X_M_P_P (instant messaging).
Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) allows data packets to be used for
_s_y_n_c_h_r_o_n_o_u_s voice communications. The data packets are marked as voice type
packets and can be prioritized by the network administrators so that the real-
time, synchronous conversation is less subject to contention with other types
of data traffic which can be delayed (i.e. file transfer or email) or buffered
in advance (i.e. audio and video) without detriment. That prioritization is
fine when the network has sufficient capacity for all the VoIP calls taking
place at the same time and the network is enabled for prioritization i.e. a
private corporate style network, but the Internet is not generally managed in
this way and so there can be a big difference in the quality of VoIP calls over
a private network and over the public Internet._[_8_9_]

Despite the growth of the Internet, the characteristics of local area networks
("LAN" ‚Äì computer networks that do not extend beyond a few kilometers in
size) remain distinct. This is because networks on this scale do not require
all the features associated with larger networks and are often more cost-
effective and efficient without them. When they are not connected with the
Internet, they also have the advantages of privacy and security. However,
purposefully lacking a direct connection to the Internet will not provide 100%
protection of the LAN from hackers, military forces, or economic powers. These
threats exist if there are any methods for connecting remotely to the LAN.
There are also independent _w_i_d_e_ _a_r_e_a_ _n_e_t_w_o_r_k_s ("WAN" ‚Äì private computer
networks that can and do extend for thousands of kilometers.) Once again, some
of their advantages include their privacy, security, and complete ignoring of
any potential hackers ‚Äì who cannot "touch" them. Of course, prime users of
private LANs and WANs include armed forces and intelligence agencies that must
keep their information completely secure and secret.
In the mid-1980s, several sets of communication protocols emerged to fill the
gaps between the data-link layer and the application layer of the _O_S_I_ _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e
_m_o_d_e_l. These included _A_p_p_l_e_t_a_l_k, _I_P_X, and _N_e_t_B_I_O_S with the dominant protocol
set during the early 1990s being IPX due to its popularity with _M_S_-_D_O_S users.
_T_C_P_/_I_P existed at this point, but it was typically only used by large
government and research facilities._[_9_0_]
As the Internet grew in popularity and a larger percentage of traffic became
Internet-related, LANs and WANs gradually moved towards the TCP/IP protocols,
and today networks mostly dedicated to TCP/IP traffic are common. The move to
TCP/IP was helped by technologies such as _D_H_C_P that allowed TCP/IP clients to
discover their own network address ‚Äî a function that came standard with the
AppleTalk/ IPX/ NetBIOS protocol sets._[_9_1_]
It is at the data-link layer, though, that most modern LANs diverge from the
Internet. Whereas Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) or Multiprotocol Label
Switching (MPLS) are typical data-link protocols for larger networks such as
WANs; Ethernet and _T_o_k_e_n_ _R_i_n_g are typical data-link protocols for LANs. These
protocols differ from the former protocols in that they are simpler (e.g. they
omit features such as _Q_u_a_l_i_t_y_ _o_f_ _S_e_r_v_i_c_e guarantees) and offer _c_o_l_l_i_s_i_o_n
_p_r_e_v_e_n_t_i_o_n. Both of these differences allow for more economical systems._[_9_2_]
Despite the modest popularity of IBM token ring in the 1980s and 1990s,
virtually all LANs now use either wired or wireless Ethernets. At the physical
layer, most wired Ethernet implementations use _c_o_p_p_e_r_ _t_w_i_s_t_e_d_-_p_a_i_r_ _c_a_b_l_e_s
(including the common _1_0_B_A_S_E_-_T networks). However, some early implementations
used heavier coaxial cables and some recent implementations (especially high-
speed ones) use optical fibers._[_9_3_] When optic fibers are used, the distinction
must be made between multimode fibers and single-mode fibers. _M_u_l_t_i_m_o_d_e_ _f_i_b_e_r_s
can be thought of as thicker optical fibers that are cheaper to manufacture
devices for but that suffers from less usable bandwidth and worse attenuation
‚Äì implying poorer long-distance performance._[_9_4_]
