There are four identifiable types of warehouses._[_1_] The cotton industry was co-
terminus with the development of the warehouse, and all five types were
represented in _M_a_n_c_h_e_s_t_e_r, United Kingdom. Warehouses in Manchester were often
lavishly decorated juxtaposing with the modern view of warehouses which are
assumed to be standard industrial buildings._[_2_]

and handled in individual units and placed in an outer carton, tote or other
container before shipping. Catalog companies and internet retailers are
examples of predominantly piece-pick operations. Their customers rarely order
in pallet or case quantities; instead, they typically order just one or two
pieces of one or two items.
According to "PICK THIS!," several elements make up the piece-pick system. They
include the order, the picker, the pick module, the pick area, handling
equipment, the container, the pick method used and the information technology
used._[_7_]

Automatic storage warehouse for small parts
Some warehouses are completely _a_u_t_o_m_a_t_e_d, and require only operators to work
and handle all the task. Pallets and product move on a system of automated
_c_o_n_v_e_y_o_r_s, _c_r_a_n_e_s and _a_u_t_o_m_a_t_e_d_ _s_t_o_r_a_g_e_ _a_n_d_ _r_e_t_r_i_e_v_a_l_ _s_y_s_t_e_m_s coordinated by

temperatures are kept very cold to keep product from spoiling, especially in
electronics warehouse where they require specific temperature to avoid damaging
the parts, and also where land is expensive, as automated storage systems can
use vertical space efficiently. These high-bay storage areas are often more
than 10 meters (33 feet) high, with some over 20 meters (65 feet) high.
Automated storage systems can be built up to 40m high.
For a warehouse to function efficiently, the facility must be properly slotted.
Slotting addresses which storage medium a product is picked from (_p_a_l_l_e_t_ _r_a_c_k

Traditional warehousing has declined since the last decades of the 20th
century, with the gradual introduction of _J_u_s_t_ _I_n_ _T_i_m_e (JIT) techniques. The
JIT system promotes product delivery directly from suppliers to consumer
without the use of warehouses. However, with the gradual implementation of
_o_f_f_s_h_o_r_e_ _o_u_t_s_o_u_r_c_i_n_g and _o_f_f_s_h_o_r_i_n_g in about the same time period, the distance
between the manufacturer and the retailer (or the parts manufacturer and the
industrial plant) grew considerably in many domains, necessitating at least one
warehouse per country or per region in any typical _s_u_p_p_l_y_ _c_h_a_i_n for a given
range of products.
Recent retailing trends have led to the development of _w_a_r_e_h_o_u_s_e_-_s_t_y_l_e_ _r_e_t_a_i_l
_s_t_o_r_e_s. These high-ceiling buildings display retail goods on tall, heavy duty
industrial racks rather than conventional retail shelving. Typically, items
ready for sale are on the bottom of the racks, and crated or palletized
inventory is in the upper rack. Essentially, the same building serves as both
warehouse and retail store.
Another trend relates to _V_e_n_d_o_r_ _M_a_n_a_g_e_d_ _I_n_v_e_n_t_o_r_y (VMI). This gives the vendor
the control to maintain the level of stock in the store. This method has its
own issue that the vendor gains access to the warehouse.
Large exporters/manufacturers use warehouses as distribution points for
developing retail outlets in a particular region or country. This concept
reduces end cost to the consumer and enhances the production sale ratio.
Cross docking is a specialised type of distribution center (DC) in that little
or no inventory is stored and product is received, processed (if needed) and
shipped within a short timeframe. As in warehousing, there are different types
of cross docks.
Reverse logistics is another type of warehousing that has gained attention in
our "green-conscious" world. The term refers to items that are going from the
end user back to the distributor or manufacturer.

Cold storage preserves agricultural products. _R_e_f_r_i_g_e_r_a_t_e_d storage helps in
eliminating _s_p_r_o_u_t_i_n_g, _r_o_t_t_i_n_g and insect damage. Edible products are generally
not stored for more than one year. Several _p_e_r_i_s_h_a_b_l_e products require a
storage temperature as low as -25¬∞C.
Cold storage helps stabilize _m_a_r_k_e_t_ _p_r_i_c_e_s and evenly distribute goods both on
demand basis and time basis. The farmers get the opportunity of producing _c_a_s_h
_c_r_o_p_s to get remunerative prices. The consumers get the supply of perishable
commodities with lower fluctuation of prices.
_A_m_m_o_n_i_a and _F_r_e_o_n compressors are commonly used in cold storage warehouses to
maintain the temperature. Ammonia refrigerant is cheaper, easily available and
has a high latent _h_e_a_t_ _o_f_ _e_v_a_p_o_r_a_t_i_o_n but it is also highly _t_o_x_i_c and can form
an explosive mixture when mixed with oil containing high percentage of carbon.
_I_n_s_u_l_a_t_i_o_n is also important, to reduce loss of cold and to keep different
sections of the warehouse at different temperatures.
There are two main types of refrigeration system used in cold storage
warehouses, a _V_a_p_o_u_r_ _a_b_s_o_r_p_t_i_o_n_ _s_y_s_t_e_m (VAS) and _V_a_p_o_u_r_ _c_o_m_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n_ _s_y_s_t_e_m
(VCS). VAS, although comparatively costlier, is quite economical in operation
and adequately compensates the higher initial investment.
The temperature necessary for _p_r_e_s_e_r_v_a_t_i_o_n depends on the storage time required
and the type of product. In general, there are three groups of products, foods
that are alive (e.g. fruits and vegetables), foods that are no longer alive and
have been processed in some form (e.g. meat and fish products), and commodities
that benefit from storage at controlled temperature (e.g. beer, tobacco).
Location is a very critical aspect for the success of cold storage. It should
be in close proximity of a growing area as well as a market, be easily
accessible for heavy vehicles, and have uninterrupted power supply.

There are state and local laws which regulate the cold store industry,
requiring safe working conditions for employees, and operational procedures
must be in accordance with these laws. Those companies which do their homework
and prepare in advance for inspections and other routine enforcement _p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l_s
will be able to continue operating at full capacity, ensuring greater customer
service and more product flow seven days a week.

Refrigerated warehousing industries make up approximately one fifth of the
market size of general warehousing._[_9_] Most of the market is concentrated in
the Midwest, but California has the largest market share of the states. In
2006, the average market size of the industry was slightly over $3 billion, and
the market continued growing in the following half decade.
The capacity of Refrigerated Warehouses in the United States: October 1, 2011

Internet-based stores do not require physical retail space, but still require
warehouses to store goods. This kind of warehouse fills many small orders
directly from customers rather than fewer large orders from stores.
Having a large and complex _s_u_p_p_l_y_ _c_h_a_i_n containing many warehouse can be
costly. It may be beneficial for a company to have one large warehouse per
continent, typically located centrally to transportation. At these continental
hubs, goods may be customized for different countries. For example, goods get a
price ticket in the language of the destination country. Small, in-warehouse
adjustments to goods are called _v_a_l_u_e_ _a_d_d_e_d services.
