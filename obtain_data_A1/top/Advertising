Most commonly, the desired result is to drive consumer behavior with respect to
a commercial offering, although political and ideological advertising is also
common. This type of work belongs to a category called _a_f_f_e_c_t_i_v_e_ _l_a_b_o_r.

In Latin, ad vertere means "to turn toward."[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] The purpose of
advertising may also be to reassure employees or shareholders that a company is
viable or successful. Advertising messages are usually paid for by _s_p_o_n_s_o_r_s and

_m_e_s_s_a_g_e_s and political campaign displays have been found in the ruins of

advertising is another manifestation of an ancient advertising form, which is
present to this day in many parts of Asia, Africa, and South America. The
tradition of wall painting can be traced back to Indian _r_o_c_k_ _a_r_t paintings that
date back to 4000 BC._[_9_] History tells us that _O_u_t_-_o_f_-_h_o_m_e_ _a_d_v_e_r_t_i_s_i_n_g and
_b_i_l_l_b_o_a_r_d_s are the oldest forms of advertising.
As the towns and cities of the _M_i_d_d_l_e_ _A_g_e_s began to grow, and the general
populace was unable to read, signs that today would say cobbler, miller, tailor
or blacksmith would use an image associated with their trade such as a boot, a
suit, a hat, a clock, a diamond, a horse shoe, a candle or even a bag of flour.
Fruits and vegetables were sold in the city square from the backs of carts and
wagons and their proprietors used street callers (_t_o_w_n_ _c_r_i_e_r_s) to announce
their whereabouts for the convenience of the customers.
As education became an apparent need and reading, as well as printing,
developed advertising expanded to include handbills.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] In the
18th century[_w_h_e_n_?] advertisements started to appear in weekly newspapers in
England. These early print advertisements were used mainly to promote books and
newspapers, which became increasingly affordable with advances in the _p_r_i_n_t_i_n_g
_p_r_e_s_s; and medicines, which were increasingly sought after as disease ravaged

A 1900 advertisement for Pears soap.
_T_h_o_m_a_s_ _J_._ _B_a_r_r_a_t_t from _L_o_n_d_o_n has been called "the father of modern
advertising"._[_1_0_]_[_1_1_]_[_1_2_] Working for the _P_e_a_r_s_ _S_o_a_p company, Barratt created
an effective advertising campaign for the company products, which involved the
use of targeted slogans, images and phrases. One of his slogans, ""Good
morning. Have you used Pears' soap?" was famous in its day[_w_h_e_n_?] and well into
the 20th century._[_1_3_]_[_1_4_] Under Barratt's guidance, Pears Soap became the
world's first legally registered brand[_w_h_e_n_?] and is therefore the world's
oldest continuously existing brand.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]
An advertising tactic that he used was to associate the Pears brand with high
culture and quality. Most famously, he used the painting _B_u_b_b_l_e_s by _J_o_h_n
_E_v_e_r_e_t_t_ _M_i_l_l_a_i_s as an advertisement by adding a bar of Pears soap into the
foreground. (Millais protested at this alteration of his work, but in vain as
Barrat had bought the copyright._[_1_5_]) Barratt continued this theme with a
series of adverts of well groomed middle-class children, associating Pears with
domestic comfort and aspirations of high society.
Barrat established Pears Annual in 1891 as a spin-off magazine which promoted
contemporary illustration and colour printing and in 1897 added the Pears
Cyclopedia a one-volume encyclopedia._[_1_6_] From the early 20th century Pears was
famous for the annual "Miss Pears" competition in which parents entered their
children into the high-profile hunt for a young brand ambassador to be used on
packaging and in consumer promotions. He recruited scientists and the
celebrities of the day to publicly endorse the product. _L_i_l_l_i_e_ _L_a_n_g_t_r_y, a
British _m_u_s_i_c_ _h_a_l_l singer and stage actress with a famous ivory complexion,
received income as the first woman to endorse a commercial product, advertising
Pears Soap.
Barratt introduced many of the crucial ideas that lie behind successful
advertising and these were widely circulated in his day. He constantly stressed
the importance of a strong and exclusive brand image for Pears and of
emphasizing the product's availability through saturation campaigns. He also
understood the importance of constantly reevaluating the market for changing
tastes and mores, stating in 1907 that "tastes change, fashions change, and the
advertiser has to change with them. An idea that was effective a generation ago
would fall flat, stale, and unprofitable if presented to the public today. Not
that the idea of today is always better than the older idea, but it is
different - it hits the present taste."_[_1_1_]
As the economy expanded across the world during the 19th century, advertising
grew alongside. In the United States, the success of this advertising format
eventually led to the growth of mail-order advertising.
In June 1836, French newspaper _L_a_ _P_r_e_s_s_e was the first to include paid
advertising in its pages, allowing it to lower its price, extend its readership
and increase its _p_r_o_f_i_t_a_b_i_l_i_t_y and the formula was soon copied by all titles.
Around 1840, _V_o_l_n_e_y_ _B_._ _P_a_l_m_e_r established the roots of the modern day
advertising agency in Philadelphia. In 1842 Palmer bought large amounts of
space in various newspapers at a discounted rate then resold the space at
higher rates to advertisers. The actual ad - the copy, layout, and artwork -
was still prepared by the company wishing to advertise; in effect, Palmer was a
space broker. The situation changed in the late 19th century when the
advertising agency of N.W. Ayer & Son was founded. Ayer and Son offered to
plan, create, and execute complete advertising campaigns for its customers. By
1900 the advertising agency had become the focal point of creative planning,
and advertising was firmly established as a profession. _[_1_7_] Around the same
time, in France, _C_h_a_r_l_e_s_-_L_o_u_i_s_ _H_a_v_a_s extended the services of his news agency,
_H_a_v_a_s to include advertisement brokerage, making it the first French group to
organize. At first, agencies were brokers for advertisement space in
newspapers. _N_._ _W_._ _A_y_e_r_ _&_ _S_o_n was the first full-service agency to assume
responsibility for advertising content. N.W. Ayer opened in 1869, and was
located in Philadelphia._[_1_7_]

At the turn of the 20th century, there were few career choices for women in
business; however, advertising was one of the few. Since women were responsible
for most of the purchasing done in their _h_o_u_s_e_h_o_l_d, advertisers and agencies
recognized the value of women's insight during the _c_r_e_a_t_i_v_e_ _p_r_o_c_e_s_s. In fact,
the first American advertising to use a _s_e_x_u_a_l_ _s_e_l_l was created by a woman â
for a soap product. Although tame by today's standards, the advertisement
featured a couple with the message "The skin you love to touch"._[_1_8_][_n_o_n_-

Modern advertising was created with the innovative techniques used in tobacco
advertising beginning in the 1920s, most significantly with the campaigns of

In the early 1920s, the first radio stations were established by radio
equipment manufacturers and retailers who offered programs in order to sell
more radios to consumers. As time passed, many non-profit organizations
followed suit in setting up their own radio stations, and included: schools,
clubs and civic groups._[_2_0_]

When the practice of sponsoring programs was popularized, each individual radio
program was usually sponsored by a single business in exchange for a brief
mention of the business' name at the beginning and end of the sponsored shows.
However, radio station owners soon realized they could earn more money by
selling sponsorship rights in small time allocations to multiple businesses
throughout their radio station's broadcasts, rather than selling the
sponsorship rights to single businesses per show.

The advertising techniques used to promote commercial goods and services can be
used to inform, educate and motivate the public about non-commercial issues,
such as HIV/AIDS,[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] political ideology, energy conservation and
deforestation.
Advertising, in its non-commercial guise, is a powerful educational tool
capable of reaching and motivating large audiences. "Advertising justifies its
existence when used in the public interestâit is much too powerful a tool to
use solely for commercial purposes." Attributed to _H_o_w_a_r_d_ _G_o_s_s_a_g_e by _D_a_v_i_d

techniques (generally associated with commercial enterprise) on behalf of non-
commercial, public interest issues and initiatives.
In the United States, the granting of television and radio licenses by the FCC
is contingent upon the station broadcasting a certain amount of public service
advertising. To meet these requirements, many broadcast stations in America air
the bulk of their required public service announcements during the late night
or early morning when the smallest percentage of viewers are watching, leaving
more day and prime time commercial slots available for high-paying advertisers.
Public service advertising reached its height during _W_o_r_l_d_ _W_a_r_s_ _I and _I_I under
the direction of more than one government. During WWII President Roosevelt
commissioned the creation of The War Advertising Council (now known as the _A_d
_C_o_u_n_c_i_l) which is the nation's largest developer of PSA campaigns on behalf of
government agencies and non-profit organizations, including the longest-running

early 1950s. A fierce battle was fought between those seeking to commercialise
the radio and people who argued that the radio spectrum should be considered a
part of the commons â to be used only non-commercially and for the public
good. The United Kingdom pursued a public funding model for the BBC, originally
a private company, the _B_r_i_t_i_s_h_ _B_r_o_a_d_c_a_s_t_i_n_g_ _C_o_m_p_a_n_y, but incorporated as a
public body by _R_o_y_a_l_ _C_h_a_r_t_e_r in 1927. In Canada, advocates like _G_r_a_h_a_m_ _S_p_r_y
were likewise able to persuade the federal government to adopt a public funding
model, creating the _C_a_n_a_d_i_a_n_ _B_r_o_a_d_c_a_s_t_i_n_g_ _C_o_r_p_o_r_a_t_i_o_n. However, in the United

_A_c_t_ _o_f_ _1_9_3_4 which created the _F_e_d_e_r_a_l_ _C_o_m_m_u_n_i_c_a_t_i_o_n_s_ _C_o_m_m_i_s_s_i_o_n (FCC)._[_2_0_]

selling advertisement time to multiple sponsors. Previously, DuMont had trouble
finding sponsors for many of their programs and compensated by selling smaller
blocks of advertising time to several businesses. This eventually became the
standard for the commercial television industry in the United States. However,
it was still a common practice to have single sponsor shows, such as _T_h_e_ _U_n_i_t_e_d
_S_t_a_t_e_s_ _S_t_e_e_l_ _H_o_u_r. In some instances the sponsors exercised great control over
the content of the showâup to and including having one's advertising agency
actually writing the show. The single sponsor model is much less prevalent now,

In the 1960s, campaigns featuring heavy spending in different mass media

hundreds of millions of dollars on a brand awareness campaign built around the

Entire corporations operated solely on advertising revenue, offering everything
from _c_o_u_p_o_n_s to free Internet access. At the turn of the 20th to 21st century,
a number of websites, including the _s_e_a_r_c_h_ _e_n_g_i_n_e _G_o_o_g_l_e, started a change in

The share of advertising spending relative to _G_D_P has changed little across
large changes in media. For example, in the US in 1925, the main advertising
media were newspapers, magazines, signs on _s_t_r_e_e_t_c_a_r_s, and outdoor _p_o_s_t_e_r_s.
Advertising spending as a share of GDP was about 2.9 percent. By 1998,
television and radio had become major advertising media. Nonetheless,
advertising spending as a share of GDP was slightly lowerâabout 2.4 percent.

A recent advertising innovation is "_g_u_e_r_r_i_l_l_a_ _m_a_r_k_e_t_i_n_g", which involves
unusual approaches such as staged encounters in public places, giveaways of
products such as cars that are covered with brand messages, and interactive
advertising where the viewer can respond to become part of the advertising
message. Guerrilla advertising is becoming increasingly more popular with a lot
of companies. This type of advertising is unpredictable and innovative, which
causes consumers to buy the product or idea. This reflects an increasing trend

The advertising business model has also been adapted in recent years. A new
development is _m_e_d_i_a_ _f_o_r_ _e_q_u_i_t_y. Here, advertising is not sold, but provided to
start-up companies in return for equity. If the company grows and is sold,
media companies receive cash for their shares.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]
Domain owners (usually those who buy domains as an investment) sometimes "park"
their domains and allow advertising companies to place ads on their sites in
return for a per-click payment.

Various competing models of hierarchies of effects attempt to provide a
theoretical underpinning to advertising practice._[_2_7_]
    * The model of Clow and Baack_[_2_8_] clarifies the objectives of an
      advertising campaign and for each individual advertisement. The model
      postulates six steps a consumer or buyer moves through when making a
      purchase:
         1. Awareness
         2. Knowledge
         3. Liking
         4. Preference
         5. Conviction
         6. Purchase
    * Means-End Theory suggests that an advertisement should contain a message
      or means that leads the consumer to a desired end-state.
    * Leverage Points aim to move the consumer from understanding a product's
      benefits to linking those benefits with personal values.

The marketing mix has been the key concept to advertising. The marketing mix
was suggested by professor _E_._ _J_e_r_o_m_e_ _M_c_C_a_r_t_h_y in the 1960s. The marketing mix
consists of four basic elements called the four Pâs. Product is the first P
representing the actual product. Price represents the process of determining
the value of a product. Place represents the variables of getting the product
to the consumer like distribution channels, market coverage and movement
organization. The last P stands for Promotion which is the process of reaching
the target market and convincing them to go out and buy the product.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n

      The TV commercial is generally considered the most effective mass-market
      advertising format, as is reflected by the high prices TV networks charge
      for commercial _a_i_r_t_i_m_e during popular TV events. The annual _S_u_p_e_r_ _B_o_w_l
      _f_o_o_t_b_a_l_l game in the United States is known as the most prominent
      advertising event on television. The average cost of a single thirty-
      second TV spot during this game has reached US$3.5 million (as of 2012).
      Some television commercials feature a song or _j_i_n_g_l_e that listeners soon
      relate to the product. Virtual advertisements may be inserted into
      regular television programming through computer graphics. It is typically
      inserted into otherwise blank backdrops_[_2_9_] or used to replace local
      billboards that are not relevant to the remote broadcast audience._[_3_0_]
      More controversially, virtual billboards may be inserted into the
      background_[_3_1_] where none exist in real-life. This technique is
      especially used in televised sporting events._[_3_2_]_[_3_3_] Virtual product

      An infomercial is a long-format television commercial, typically five
      minutes or longer. The word "infomercial" is a portmanteau of the words
      "information" & "commercial". The main objective in an infomercial is to
      create an _i_m_p_u_l_s_e_ _p_u_r_c_h_a_s_e, so that the consumer sees the presentation

  Radio advertising
      RRaaddiioo aaddvveerrttiissiinngg is a form of advertising via the medium of _r_a_d_i_o. Radio
      advertisements are broadcast as radio waves to the air from a transmitter
      to an antenna and a thus to a receiving device. Airtime is purchased from
      a _s_t_a_t_i_o_n or _n_e_t_w_o_r_k in exchange for airing the commercials. While radio
      has the limitation of being restricted to sound, proponents of radio
      advertising often cite this as an advantage. Radio is an expanding medium
      that can be found not only on air, but also online. According to
      Arbitron, radio has approximately 241.6 million weekly listeners, or more
      than 93 percent of the U.S. population.
  Online advertising
      Online advertising is a form of _p_r_o_m_o_t_i_o_n that uses the Internet and
      _W_o_r_l_d_ _W_i_d_e_ _W_e_b for the expressed purpose of delivering marketing messages
      to attract customers. Online ads are delivered by an ad server. Examples
      of online advertising include contextual ads that appear on _s_e_a_r_c_h_ _e_n_g_i_n_e

  New media
      Technological development and economic globalization favors the emergence
      of new and new communication channels and new techniques of commercial
      messaging.
  Product placements
      CCoovveerrtt aaddvveerrttiissiinngg, is when a product or brand is embedded in
      entertainment and media. For example, in a film, the main character can
      use an item or other of a definite brand, as in the movie _M_i_n_o_r_i_t_y
      _R_e_p_o_r_t, where _T_o_m_ _C_r_u_i_s_e's character John Anderton owns a phone with the
      _N_o_k_i_a logo clearly written in the top corner, or his watch engraved with
      the _B_u_l_g_a_r_i logo. Another example of advertising in film is in _I_,_ _R_o_b_o_t,
      where main character played by _W_i_l_l_ _S_m_i_t_h mentions his _C_o_n_v_e_r_s_e shoes
      several times, calling them "classics," because the film is set far in
      the future. I, Robot and _S_p_a_c_e_b_a_l_l_s also showcase futuristic cars with
      the _A_u_d_i and _M_e_r_c_e_d_e_s_-_B_e_n_z logos clearly displayed on the front of the
      vehicles. _C_a_d_i_l_l_a_c chose to advertise in the movie _T_h_e_ _M_a_t_r_i_x_ _R_e_l_o_a_d_e_d,
      which as a result contained many scenes in which Cadillac cars were used.
      Similarly, product placement for _O_m_e_g_a_ _W_a_t_c_h_e_s, _F_o_r_d, _V_A_I_O, _B_M_W and _A_s_t_o_n
      _M_a_r_t_i_n cars are featured in recent _J_a_m_e_s_ _B_o_n_d films, most notably _C_a_s_i_n_o
      _R_o_y_a_l_e. In "_F_a_n_t_a_s_t_i_c_ _F_o_u_r_:_ _R_i_s_e_ _o_f_ _t_h_e_ _S_i_l_v_e_r_ _S_u_r_f_e_r", the main
      transport vehicle shows a large _D_o_d_g_e logo on the front. _B_l_a_d_e_ _R_u_n_n_e_r
      includes some of the most obvious product placement; the whole film stops
      to show a _C_o_c_a_-_C_o_l_a billboard.
  Press advertising
      Press advertising describes advertising in a printed medium such as a
      newspaper, _m_a_g_a_z_i_n_e, or trade journal. This encompasses everything from
      media with a very broad readership base, such as a major national
      newspaper or magazine, to more narrowly targeted media such as local
      newspapers and trade journals on very specialized topics. A form of press
      advertising is _c_l_a_s_s_i_f_i_e_d_ _a_d_v_e_r_t_i_s_i_n_g, which allows private individuals
      or companies to purchase a small, narrowly targeted ad for a low fee
      advertising a product or service. Another form of press advertising is
      the Display Ad, which is a larger ad (can include art) that typically run
      in an article section of a newspaper.
  Billboard advertising
      _B_i_l_l_b_o_a_r_d_s are large structures located in public places which display
      advertisements to passing pedestrians and motorists. Most often, they are
      located on main roads with a large amount of passing motor and pedestrian
      traffic; however, they can be placed in any location with large amounts
      of viewers, such as on mass transit vehicles and in stations, in shopping
      malls or office buildings, and in stadiums.
The _R_e_d_E_y_e newspaper advertised to its target market at _N_o_r_t_h_ _A_v_e_n_u_e_ _B_e_a_c_h with
a sailboat billboard on _L_a_k_e_ _M_i_c_h_i_g_a_n.
  Mobile billboard advertising
      _M_o_b_i_l_e_ _b_i_l_l_b_o_a_r_d_s are generally vehicle mounted _b_i_l_l_b_o_a_r_d_s or digital
      screens. These can be on dedicated vehicles built solely for carrying
      advertisements along routes preselected by clients, they can also be
      specially equipped cargo trucks or, in some cases, large banners strewn
      from planes. The billboards are often lighted; some being _b_a_c_k_l_i_t, and
      others employing spotlights. Some billboard displays are static, while
      others change; for example, continuously or periodically rotating among a
      set of advertisements. Mobile displays are used for various situations in
      metropolitan areas throughout the world, including: Target advertising,
      One-day, and long-term campaigns, Conventions, Sporting events, Store
      openings and similar promotional events, and Big advertisements from
      smaller companies.
  In-store advertising
      In-store advertising is any advertisement placed in a retail store. It
      includes placement of a product in visible locations in a store, such as
      at eye level, at the ends of aisles and near checkout counters (aka
      POPâPoint of Purchase display), eye-catching displays promoting a
      specific product, and advertisements in such places as shopping carts and
      in-store video displays.
  Coffee cup advertising
      Coffee cup advertising is any advertisement placed upon a coffee cup that
      is distributed out of an office, cafÃ©, or drive-through coffee shop.
      This form of advertising was first popularized in Australia, and has
      begun growing in popularity in the United States, India, and parts of the
      Middle East.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]
  Street advertising
      This type of advertising first came to prominence in the UK by Street
      Advertising Services to create outdoor advertising on street furniture
      and pavements. Working with products such as _R_e_v_e_r_s_e_ _G_r_a_f_f_i_t_i, _a_i_r
      _d_a_n_c_e_r_s and 3D pavement advertising, the media became an affordable and
      effective tool for getting brand messages out into public spaces.

  Sheltered Outdoor Advertising
      This type of advertising opens the possibility of combining outdoor with
      indoor advertisement by placing large mobile, structures (_t_e_n_t_s) in
      public places on temporary bases. The large outer advertising space
      exerts a strong pull on the observer, the product is promoted indoor,
      where the creative decor can intensify the impression.
  _C_e_l_e_b_r_i_t_y_ _b_r_a_n_d_i_n_g
      This type of advertising focuses upon using celebrity power, fame, money,
      popularity to gain recognition for their products and promote specific
      stores or products. Advertisers often advertise their products, for
      example, when celebrities share their favorite products or wear clothes
      by specific brands or designers. Celebrities are often involved in
      advertising campaigns such as television or print adverts to advertise
      specific or general products. The use of celebrities to endorse a brand
      can have its downsides, however. One mistake by a celebrity can be
      detrimental to the public relations of a brand. For example, following
      his performance of eight gold medals at the 2008 Olympic Games in
      Beijing, China, swimmer Michael Phelps' contract with Kellogg's was
      terminated, as Kellogg's did not want to associate with him after he was
      photographed smoking marijuana. Celebrities such as _B_r_i_t_n_e_y_ _S_p_e_a_r_s have

Advertising is at the front of delivering the proper message to customers and
prospective customers. The purpose of advertising is to convince customers that
the company products are the best, enhance the image of the company, point out
and create a need for products or services, demonstrate new uses for
established products, announce new products and programs, reinforce the
salespeople's individual messages, draw customers to the business, and to hold
existing customers. _[_3_6_]

Sales promotions are another way to advertise. Sales promotions are double
purposed because they are used to gather information about what type of
customers you draw in and where they are, and to jumpstart sales. Sales
promotions include things like contests and games, sweepstakes, product
giveaways, samples coupons, loyalty programs, and discounts. The ultimate goal
of sales promotions is to stimulate potential customers to action._[_3_7_]

Increasingly, other media are overtaking many of the "traditional" media such
as television, radio and newspaper because of a shift toward consumer's usage

unique ability to see the _t_a_r_g_e_t_ _a_u_d_i_e_n_c_e where they are reached by the medium.
Technological advances have also made it possible to control the message on
digital signage with much precision, enabling the messages to be relevant to
the target audience at any given time and location which in turn, gets more
response from the advertising. Digital signage is being successfully employed
in supermarkets._[_3_9_] Another successful use of digital signage is in
hospitality locations such as restaurants._[_4_0_] and malls._[_4_1_]
Advertising on the World Wide Web is a recent phenomenon. Prices of Web-based
advertising space are dependent on the "relevance" of the surrounding web
content and the traffic that the website receives.
Reasons for online display advertising: Display ads generate awareness quickly.
Unlike search, which requires someone to be aware of a need, display
advertising can drive awareness of something new and without previous
knowledge. Display works well for direct response. Display is not only used for
generating awareness, itâs used for direct response campaigns that link to a
landing page with a clear âcall to actionâ.
E-mail advertising is another recent phenomenon. Unsolicited bulk E-mail
advertising is known as "_e_-_m_a_i_l_ _s_p_a_m". Spam has been a problem for e-mail users
for many years.
A new form of advertising that is growing rapidly is social network
advertising. It is online advertising with a focus on social networking sites.
This is a relatively immature market, but it has shown a lot of promise as
advertisers are able to take advantage of the demographic information the user
has provided to the social networking site. Friendertising is a more precise
advertising term in which people are able to direct advertisements toward
others directly using social network services.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]

Unpaid advertising (also called "publicity advertising"), can provide good
exposure at minimal cost. Personal recommendations ("bring a friend", "sell
it"), spreading buzz, or achieving the feat of equating a brand with a common
noun (in the United States, "_X_e_r_o_x" = "_p_h_o_t_o_c_o_p_i_e_r", "_K_l_e_e_n_e_x" = _t_i_s_s_u_e,

_a_d_h_e_s_i_v_e_ _b_a_n_d_a_g_e) â these can be seen as the pinnacle of any advertising
campaign. However, some companies oppose the use of their brand name to label
an object. Equating a brand with a common noun also risks turning that brand
into a _g_e_n_e_r_i_c_i_z_e_d_ _t_r_a_d_e_m_a_r_k - turning it into a generic term which means that
its legal protection as a _t_r_a_d_e_m_a_r_k is lost.

With the Internet came many new advertising opportunities. Popup, _F_l_a_s_h,
banner, Popunder, _a_d_v_e_r_g_a_m_i_n_g, and email advertisements (all of which are often
unwanted or spam in the case of email) are now commonplace. Particularly since
the rise of "entertaining" advertising, some people may like an advertisement
enough to wish to watch it later or show a friend. In general, the advertising
community has not yet made this easy, although some have used the Internet to
widely distribute their ads to anyone willing to see or hear them. In the last
three-quarters of 2009 mobile and internet advertising grew by 18.1% and 9.2%
respectively. Older media advertising saw declines: â10.1% (TV), â11.7%
(radio), â14.8% (magazines) and â18.7% (newspapers ).[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]

Another significant trend regarding future of advertising is the growing
importance of the _n_i_c_h_e_ _m_a_r_k_e_t using niche or targeted ads. Also brought about
by the Internet and the theory of _T_h_e_ _L_o_n_g_ _T_a_i_l, advertisers will have an
increasing ability to reach specific audiences. In the past, the most efficient
way to deliver a message was to blanket the largest _m_a_s_s_ _m_a_r_k_e_t audience
possible. However, usage tracking, customer profiles and the growing popularity
of niche content brought about by everything from _b_l_o_g_s to social networking
sites, provide advertisers with audiences that are smaller but much better
defined, leading to ads that are more relevant to viewers and more effective
for companies' marketing products. Among others, _C_o_m_c_a_s_t_ _S_p_o_t_l_i_g_h_t is one such
advertiser employing this method in their _v_i_d_e_o_ _o_n_ _d_e_m_a_n_d menus. These
advertisements are targeted to a specific group and can be viewed by anyone
wishing to find out more about a particular business or practice at any time,
right from their home. This causes the viewer to become proactive and actually
choose what advertisements they want to view._[_4_3_]
Google AdSense is a perfect example of Niche marketing. Google Calculates the
primary purpose of the website and adjusts ads accordingly. They use key words
on the page (or even in emails) to find the general ideas of topics disused and
places ads that will most likely be clicked on by viewers of the email account
or website visitors. Google has pioneered an ingenious method of putting ads
right where they need to be.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]

The concept of _c_r_o_w_d_s_o_u_r_c_i_n_g has given way to the trend of _u_s_e_r_-_g_e_n_e_r_a_t_e_d
advertisements. User-generated ads are created by consumers as opposed to an
advertising agency or the company themselves, most often they are a result of
brand sponsored advertising competitions. For the 2007 Super Bowl, the Frito-
Lays division of _P_e_p_s_i_C_o held the Crash the Super Bowl contest, allowing
consumers to create their own _D_o_r_i_t_o_s commercial._[_4_4_] _C_h_e_v_r_o_l_e_t held a similar
competition for their Tahoe line of SUVs._[_4_4_] Due to the success of the Doritos
user-generated ads in the 2007 Super Bowl, Frito-Lays relaunched the
competition for the 2009 and 2010 Super Bowl. The resulting ads were among the
most-watched and most-liked Super Bowl ads. In fact, the winning ad that aired
in the 2009 Super Bowl was ranked by the _U_S_A_ _T_o_d_a_y_ _S_u_p_e_r_ _B_o_w_l_ _A_d_ _M_e_t_e_r as the
top ad for the year while the winning ads that aired in the 2010 Super Bowl
were found by Nielsen's BuzzMetrics to be the "most buzzed-about"._[_4_5_]_[_4_6_]
This trend has given rise to several online platforms that host user-generated
advertising competitions on behalf of a company. Founded in 2007, _Z_o_o_p_p_a has
launched ad competitions for brands such as Google, _N_i_k_e, _H_e_r_s_h_e_y_'_s, _G_e_n_e_r_a_l

Advertising has gone through five major stages of development: domestic,
export, international, multi-national, and global. For _g_l_o_b_a_l_ _a_d_v_e_r_t_i_s_e_r_s,
there are four, potentially competing, business objectives that must be

with one voice, developing _e_c_o_n_o_m_i_e_s_ _o_f_ _s_c_a_l_e in the creative process,
maximising local effectiveness of ads, and increasing the companyâs speed of
implementation. Born from the evolutionary stages of global marketing are the
three primary and fundamentally different approaches to the development of
global advertising executions: exporting executions, producing local
executions, and importing ideas that travel._[_4_8_]
Advertising research is key to determining the success of an ad in any country
or region. The ability to identify which elements and/or moments of an ad
contribute to its success is how economies of scale are maximised. Once one
knows what works in an ad, that idea or ideas can be imported by any other
market. _M_a_r_k_e_t_ _r_e_s_e_a_r_c_h measures, such as _F_l_o_w_ _o_f_ _A_t_t_e_n_t_i_o_n, _F_l_o_w_ _o_f_ _E_m_o_t_i_o_n

Foreign governments, particularly those that own marketable commercial products
or services, often promote their interests and positions through the
advertising of those goods because the target audience is not only largely
unaware of the forum as a vehicle for foreign messaging but also willing to
receive the message while in a mental state of absorbing information from
advertisements during television commercial breaks, while reading a periodical,
or while passing by billboards in public spaces. A prime example of this
messaging technique is _a_d_v_e_r_t_i_s_i_n_g_ _c_a_m_p_a_i_g_n_s_ _t_o_ _p_r_o_m_o_t_e_ _i_n_t_e_r_n_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _t_r_a_v_e_l.
While advertising foreign destinations and services may stem from the typical
goal of increasing revenue by drawing more tourism, some travel campaigns carry
the additional or alternative intended purpose of promoting good sentiments or
improving existing ones among the target audience towards a given nation or
region. It is common for advertising promoting foreign countries to be produced
and distributed by the tourism ministries of those countries, so these ads
often carry political statements and/or depictions of the foreign government's

However, the fact that these sets are ssoolldd, means the company will receive

To counter this effect, a variety of strategies have been employed. Many
advertisers have opted for product placement on TV shows like _S_u_r_v_i_v_o_r. Other
strategies include integrating advertising with internet-connected _E_P_G_s,

_[_5_3_] Advertising is increasingly invading public spaces, such as schools, which
some critics argue is a form of child exploitation._[_5_4_]_[_5_5_] In addition,
advertising frequently uses psychological pressure (for example, appealing to
feelings of inadequacy) on the intended consumer, which may be harmful. Many
even feel that often, advertisements exploit the desires of a consumer, by
making a particular product more appealing, by manipulating the consumers needs
and wants.
Today many advertisements are centered around women posing seductively. From
Carl's Jr. burgers, to Mentos mints, American Apparel, and almost any beer
commercial, women are featured to lure in customers through their sex appeal.
These thin, beautiful women are portrayed purely as objects, intended to please
those who find their images pleasurable. Advertisers take advantage of this
pleasing image and associate it with their products. Many companies are
sacrificing the dignity and self-worth of women for the success of their
products. Not only does this type of media cause men to view women as soulless
bodies, but it causes women, young and old, to set impossible standards for
their body images.

There have been increasing efforts to protect the public interest by regulating
the content and the influence of advertising. Some examples are: the ban on
television tobacco advertising imposed in many countries, and the total ban of
_a_d_v_e_r_t_i_s_i_n_g_ _t_o_ _c_h_i_l_d_r_e_n under 12 imposed by the Swedish government in 1991.
Though that regulation continues in effect for broadcasts originating within
the country, it has been weakened by the _E_u_r_o_p_e_a_n_ _C_o_u_r_t_ _o_f_ _J_u_s_t_i_c_e, which had
found that Sweden was obliged to accept foreign programming, including those
from neighboring countries or via satellite. Greeceâs regulations are of a
similar nature, âbanning advertisements for children's toys between 7 am and
10 pm and a total ban on advertisement for war toys"._[_5_6_]
In Europe and elsewhere, there is a vigorous debate on whether (or how much)
advertising to children should be regulated. This debate was exacerbated by a
report released by the _K_a_i_s_e_r_ _F_a_m_i_l_y_ _F_o_u_n_d_a_t_i_o_n in February 2004 which
suggested _f_a_s_t_ _f_o_o_d_ _a_d_v_e_r_t_i_s_i_n_g that targets children was an important factor
in the epidemic of _c_h_i_l_d_h_o_o_d_ _o_b_e_s_i_t_y in the United States.
In New Zealand, South Africa, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Canada, and many European
countries, the advertising industry operates a system of self-regulation.
Advertisers, advertising agencies and the media agree on a code of advertising
standards that they attempt to uphold. The general aim of such codes is to
ensure that any advertising is 'legal, decent, honest and truthful'. Some self-
regulatory organizations are funded by the industry, but remain independent,
with the intent of upholding the standards or codes like the _A_d_v_e_r_t_i_s_i_n_g
_S_t_a_n_d_a_r_d_s_ _A_u_t_h_o_r_i_t_y in the UK.
In the UK, most forms of outdoor advertising such as the display of billboards
is regulated by the UK Town and County Planning system. Currently the display
of an advertisement without consent from the Planning Authority is a criminal
offense liable to a fine of Â£2,500 per offence. All of the major outdoor
billboard companies in the UK have convictions of this nature.
In the US, many communities believe that many forms of outdoor advertising
blight the public realm._[_5_7_] As long ago as the 1960s in the US there were
attempts to ban billboard advertising in the open countryside._[_5_8_] Cities such
as _S_Ã_£_o_ _P_a_u_l_o have introduced an outright ban_[_5_9_] with London also having
specific legislation to control unlawful displays.
Many advertisers employ a wide-variety of linguistic devices to bypass
regulatory laws (e.g. In France, printing English words in bold and French
translations in fine print to deal with the Article 120 of the 1994 _T_o_u_b_o_n_ _L_a_w
limiting the use of English)._[_6_0_] The advertisement of controversial products
such as cigarettes and condoms are subject to government regulation in many
countries. For instance, the tobacco industry is required by law in most
countries to display warnings cautioning consumers about the health hazards of
their products. Linguistic variation is often used by advertisers as a creative
device to reduce the impact of such requirements.

Advertising research is a specialized form of research that works to improve
the effectiveness and efficiency of advertising. It entails numerous forms of
research which employ different methodologies. Advertising research includes
pre-testing (also known as _c_o_p_y_ _t_e_s_t_i_n_g) and post-testing of ads and/or
campaignsâpre-testing is done before an ad airs to gauge how well it will
perform and post-testing is done after an ad airs to determine the in-market
impact of the ad or campaign on the consumer. Continuous _a_d_ _t_r_a_c_k_i_n_g and the

Todayâs culture is made up of meanings between consumers and marketers. These
meanings depict _s_i_g_n_s and symbols that are encoded in everyday objects._[_6_1_]
_S_e_m_i_o_t_i_c_s is the study of signs and how they are interpreted. Advertising has
many hidden signs and meanings within _b_r_a_n_d_ _n_a_m_e_s, _l_o_g_o_s, package designs,
print _a_d_v_e_r_t_i_s_e_m_e_n_t_s, and _t_e_l_e_v_i_s_i_o_n_ _a_d_v_e_r_t_i_s_e_m_e_n_t_s. The purpose of semiotics
is to study and interpret the message being conveyed in advertisements. Logos
and advertisements can be interpreted at two levels known as the surface level
and the underlying level. The surface level uses signs creatively to create an
image or personality for their product. These signs can be images, words,
fonts, _c_o_l_o_r_s, or slogan. The underlying level is made up of hidden meanings.
The combination of images, words, _c_o_l_o_r_s, and slogan must be interpreted by the
audience or consumer._[_6_2_] The âkey to advertising analysisâ is the
signifier and the signified. The signifier is the object and the signified is
the mental concept._[_6_3_] A product has a signifier and a signified. The
signifier is the _c_o_l_o_r, brand name, logo design, and technology. The signified
has two meanings known as denotative and connotative. The denotative meaning is
the meaning of the product. A televisionâs denotative meaning would be that
it is high definition. The connotative meaning is the productâs deep and
hidden meaning. A connotative meaning of a television would be that it is top
of the line._[_6_4_]
_A_p_p_l_e is an excellent example of using semiotics in their advertising campaign.
Appleâs commercials used a black silhouette of a person that was the age of
Apple's target market. They placed the silhouette in front of a blue screen so
that the picture behind the silhouette could be constantly changing. However,
the one thing that stays the same in these ads is that there is music in the
background and the silhouette is listening to that music on a white iPod
through white headphones. Through advertising, the white color on a set of
earphones now signifies that the music device is an iPod. The white color
signifies almost all of Appleâs products._[_6_5_]
The semiotics of _g_e_n_d_e_r plays a key influence on the way in which signs are
interpreted. When considering _g_e_n_d_e_r_ _r_o_l_e_s_ _i_n_ _a_d_v_e_r_t_i_s_i_n_g, individuals are
influenced by three categories. Certain characteristics of stumuli may enhance
or decrease the elaboration of the _m_e_s_s_a_g_e (if the product is perceived as
_f_e_m_i_n_i_n_e or _m_a_s_c_u_l_i_n_e). Second, the characteristics of individuals can affect
_a_t_t_e_n_t_i_o_n and elaboration of the message (_t_r_a_d_i_t_i_o_n_a_l or non-traditional _g_e_n_d_e_r
_r_o_l_e orientation). Lastly, situational factors may be important to influence
the elaboration of the message._[_6_6_]
There are two types of _m_a_r_k_e_t_i_n_g_ _c_o_m_m_u_n_i_c_a_t_i_o_n claims-objective and subjective.
_[_6_7_] Objective claims stem from the extent to which the claim associates the
brand with a tangible product or service feature. For instance, the _c_a_m_e_r_a has
auto focus features. Subjective claims convey emotional, subjective,
impressions of intangible aspects of a product or service. They are non-
physical features of a product or service that cannot be directly perceived, as
they have no physical _r_e_a_l_i_t_y. For instance the _b_r_o_c_h_u_r_e has a beautiful
_d_e_s_i_g_n._[_6_8_] _M_a_l_e_s tend to respond better to objective marketing communications
claims while _f_e_m_a_l_e_s tend to respond better to subjective _m_a_r_k_e_t_i_n_g
_c_o_m_m_u_n_i_c_a_t_i_o_n_s claims._[_6_9_]
In advertisements, men are represented as independent. They are shown in more
occupations than women. Women are represented mainly as housewives and mothers.
Men are more likely to be shown advertising cars or business products, while
women advertise domestic products. Men are more likely to be shown outdoors or
in business settings. Women are depicted in domestic settings. Men are more
often portrayed as authorities. As far as ads go, with age men seem to gain
wisdom and authority. On the other hand women seem to disappear with age.
Voiceovers are commonly used in advertising. Most _v_o_i_c_e_o_v_e_r_s are men (figures
of up to 94% have been reported). There have been more _f_e_m_a_l_e voiceovers in
recent years but mainly for food, household products, and feminine care
products._[_7_0_]

According to a 1977 study by David Statt, females process _i_n_f_o_r_m_a_t_i_o_n
comprehensively, while males process information through heuristic devices such
as procedures, methods or _s_t_r_a_t_e_g_i_e_s for solving _p_r_o_b_l_e_m_s, which could have an
effect on how they interpret advertising._[_7_1_] According to this study, men
prefer to have available and apparent cues to interpret the message where
females engage in more creative, associative, imagery-laced interpretation.
More recently, research by Martin (2003) reveals that males and females differ
in how they react to advertising depending on their mood at the time of
exposure to the ads, and the affective tone of the advertising. When feeling
sad, males prefer happy ads to boost their mood. In contrast, females prefer
happy ads when they are feeling happy. The television programs in which the ads
are embedded are shown to influence a consumer's mood state._[_7_2_]

           ...from the early days advertising has been intimately
           intertwined with tobacco. The man who is sometimes considered
           the founder of modern advertising and Madison Avenue, Edward
           Bernays, created many of the major cigarette campaigns of the
           1920s, including having women march down the street demanding
           the right to smoke.
