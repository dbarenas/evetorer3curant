Everett Rogers wrote the book Diffusion of Innovations in 1962. There would be
five editions of the book through 2003 - during which time the statistical
study of how people adopt new ideas and technology would be documented over
5000 times. The scientific study of hybrid corn seed adoption led to the
commonly known groupings of types of people: Innovators, Early Adopters, Early
Majority, Late Majority and Laggards. In 1969, Elisabeth Kubler-Ross wrote the
book On Death and Dying, which addressed the various stages of grief. In 1974,
Daryl Conner founded Conner Partners and in 1993, he wrote the book, Managing
at the Speed of Change. In this seminal work, Conner penned the analogy
"burning platform" based on the 1988 Piper off shore oil rig fire (North Sea
off the coast of Scotland)._[_3_] Conner Partners influenced the large Management
Consulting firms over the 80s and 90s as firms needed to understand the human
performance and adoption techniques to help ensure technology innovations were
absorbed and adopted as best as possible.
Linda Ackerman Anderson states in Beyond Change Management that in the late
1980s and early 1990s, top leaders, growing dissatisfied with the failures of
creating and implementing changes in a _t_o_p_-_d_o_w_n fashion, created the role of
the change leader to take responsibility for the human side of the change._[_4_]
The first "State of the Change Management Industry" report in the Consultants
News was published in February 1995._[_5_]
McKinsey consultant Julien Phillips first published a change management model
in 1982 in the journal Human Resource Management, though it took a decade for
his change management peers to catch up with him._[_6_]
Marshak_[_7_] credits the big 6 accounting firms and management consulting firms
with creating the change management industry when they branded their
reengineering services groups as change management services in the late 1980s.
In 2010, based on her book "RIMER Managing Successful Change", Christina _[_8_]
Dean, Managing Director of Uniforte Pty Ltd, established Change Management as a
formal vocation in Australia by writing the Australian National Competency
Standards in Organisational and Community Change Management, which led to the
developed of the first Australian Diploma of Organisational Change Management,
and which is an internationally recognized qualification.

Organizational change is a structured approach in an organization for ensuring
that changes are smoothly and successfully implemented to achieve lasting
benefits. In the modern business environment, organizations face rapid change
like never before. Globalization and the constant innovation of technology
result in a constantly evolving business environment. Phenomena such as _s_o_c_i_a_l
_m_e_d_i_a and mobile adaptability have revolutionized business and the effect of
this is an ever increasing need for change, and therefore change management.
The growth in technology also has a secondary effect of increasing the
availability and therefore accountability of knowledge. Easily accessible
information has resulted in unprecedented scrutiny from stockholders and the
media. Prying eyes and listening ears raise the stakes for failed business
endeavors and increase the pressure on struggling executives. With the business
environment experiencing so much change, organizations must then learn to
become comfortable with change as well. Therefore, the ability to manage and
adapt to organizational change is an essential ability required in the
workplace today.
Due to the growth of technology, modern organizational change is largely
motivated by exterior innovations rather than internal moves. When these
developments occur, the organizations that adapt quickest create a competitive
advantage for themselves, while the companies that refuse to change get left
behind. This can result in drastic profit and/or market share losses.
Organizational change directly affects all departments from the entry level
employee to senior management. The entire company must learn how to handle
changes to the organization.
When determining which of the latest techniques or innovations to adopt, there
are four major factors to be considered:
   1. Levels, goals, and strategies
   2. Measurement system
   3. Sequence of steps
   4. Implementation and organizational change
Regardless of the many types of organizational change, the critical aspect is a
company‚Äôs ability to win the buy-in of their organization‚Äôs employees on
the change. Effectively managing organizational change is a four-step process:
   1. recognizing the changes in the broader business environment.
   2. developing the necessary adjustments for their company‚Äôs needs.
   3. training their employees on the appropriate changes.
   4. winning the support of the employees with the persuasiveness of the
      appropriate adjustments.
As a multidisciplinary practice that has evolved as a result of scholarly
research, organizational change management should begin with a systematic
diagnosis of the current situation in order to determine both the need for
change and the capability to change. The objectives, content, and process of
change should all be specified as part of a Change Management plan.
Change management processes may include creative marketing to enable
communication between changing audiences, as well as deep social understanding
about leadership‚Äôs styles and group dynamics. As a visible track on
transformation projects, Organizational Change Management aligns groups‚Äô
expectations, communicates, integrates teams and manages people training. It
makes use of performance metrics, such as financial results, operational
efficiency, leadership commitment, communication effectiveness, and the
perceived need for change to design appropriate strategies, in order to avoid
change failures or resolve troubled change projects.
Successful change management is more likely to occur if the following are
included:[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]
   1. Benefits management and realization to define measurable stakeholder
      aims, create a business case for their achievement (which should be
      continuously updated), and monitor assumptions, risks, dependencies,
      costs, return on investment, dis-benefits and cultural issues affecting
      the progress of the associated work
   2. Effective communications that informs various stakeholders of the reasons
      for the change (why?), the benefits of successful implementation (what is
      in it for us, and you) as well as the details of the change (when? where?
      who is involved? how much will it cost? etc.)
   3. Devise an effective education, training and/or skills upgrading scheme
      for the organization
   4. Counter resistance from the employees of companies and align them to
      overall strategic direction of the organization
   5. Provide personal counseling (if required) to alleviate any change-related
      fears
   6. Monitoring of the implementation and fine-tuning as required
