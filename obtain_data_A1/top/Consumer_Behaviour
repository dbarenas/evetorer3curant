CCoonnssuummeerr bbeehhaavviioouurr is the study of individuals, groups, or organizations and
the processes they use to select, secure, and dispose of products, services,
experiences, or ideas to satisfy needs and the impacts that these processes
have on the consumer and society._[_1_] It blends elements from _p_s_y_c_h_o_l_o_g_y,
_s_o_c_i_o_l_o_g_y, _s_o_c_i_a_l _a_n_t_h_r_o_p_o_l_o_g_y and _e_c_o_n_o_m_i_c_s. It attempts to understand the
decision-making processes of buyers, both individually and in groups. It
studies characteristics of individual consumers such as _d_e_m_o_g_r_a_p_h_i_c_s and
behavioural variables in an attempt to understand people's wants. It also tries
to assess influences on the _c_o_n_s_u_m_e_r from groups such as family, friends,
reference groups, and society in general.
Customer behaviour study is based on consumer buying behaviour, with the
customer playing the three distinct roles of user, payer and buyer. Research
has shown that consumer behaviour is difficult to predict, even for experts in
the field._[_2_] _R_e_l_a_t_i_o_n_s_h_i_p_ _m_a_r_k_e_t_i_n_g is an influential asset for customer
behaviour analysis as it has a keen interest in the re-discovery of the true
meaning of marketing through the re-affirmation of the importance of the
customer or buyer. A greater importance is also placed on consumer retention,
customer relationship management, personalisation, customisation and one-to-one
marketing. Social functions can be categorized into _s_o_c_i_a_l_ _c_h_o_i_c_e and welfare
functions.
Each method for vote counting is assumed as social function but if _A_r_r_o_w_‚_Ä_ô_s
_p_o_s_s_i_b_i_l_i_t_y_ _t_h_e_o_r_e_m is used for a social function, social welfare function is
achieved. Some specifications of the social functions are decisiveness,
_n_e_u_t_r_a_l_i_t_y, _a_n_o_n_y_m_i_t_y, _m_o_n_o_t_o_n_i_c_i_t_y, _u_n_a_n_i_m_i_t_y, homogeneity and weak and strong
_P_a_r_e_t_o_ _o_p_t_i_m_a_l_i_t_y. No social choice function meets these requirements in an
ordinal scale simultaneously. The most important characteristic of a social
function is identification of the interactive effect of alternatives and
creating a logical relation with the ranks. Marketing provides services in
order to satisfy customers. With that in mind the productive system is
considered from its beginning at the production level, to the end of the cycle,
the consumer (Kioumarsi et al., 2009).

The black box model shows the interaction of stimuli, consumer characteristics,
decision process and consumer responses._[_3_] It can be distinguished between
interpersonal _s_t_i_m_u_l_i (between people) or intrapersonal stimuli (within
people)._[_4_] The black box model is related to the _b_l_a_c_k_ _b_o_x_ _t_h_e_o_r_y of
_b_e_h_a_v_i_o_u_r_i_s_m, where the focus is not set on the processes inside a consumer,
but the relation between the stimuli and the response of the consumer. The
_m_a_r_k_e_t_i_n_g stimuli are planned and processed by the companies, whereas the
environmental stimulus are given by social factors, based on the economical,
political and cultural circumstances of a society. The buyers black box
contains the buyer characteristics and the decision process, which determines
the buyers response.

The black box model considers the buyers response as a result of a conscious,
rational decision process, in which it is assumed that the buyer has recognized
the problem. However, in reality many decisions are not made in awareness of a
determined problem by the consumer.
********** IInnffoorrmmaattiioonn sseeaarrcchh[[_ee_dd_ii_tt_ _ss_oo_uu_rr_cc_ee¬¬ || _ee_dd_ii_tt]] **********
Once the consumer has recognised a problem, they search for information on
products and services that can solve that problem. Belch and Belch (2007)
explain that consumers undertake both an internal (memory) and an external
search. Sources of information include personal sources and experience, and
commercial and public sources.
The relevant internal psychological process associated with information search
is _p_e_r_c_e_p_t_i_o_n, which can be defined as "the process by which an individual
receives, selects, organises, and interprets information to create a meaningful
picture of the world". Consumers' tendency to search for information on goods
and services makes it possible for researchers to forecast the purchasing plans
of consumers using brief descriptions of the products of interest._[_5_]
The selective perception process can be divided into:-
    * Selective exposure: consumers select which promotional messages they will
      expose themselves to.
    * Selective attention: consumers select which promotional messages they
      will pay attention to.
    * Selective comprehension: consumer interpret messages in line with their
      beliefs, attitudes, motives and experiences.
    * Selective retention: consumers remember messages that are more meaningful
      or important to them.
The implications of this process help to develop an effective promotional
strategy, and suggest which sources of information are more effective for the
brand.

At this time the consumer compares the brands and products that are in their
evoked set. The evoked set refers to the number of alternatives that are
considered by consumers during the problem-solving process. Sometimes also
known as consideration, this set tends to be small relative to the total number
of options available. How can the marketing organisation increase the
likelihood that their brand is part of the consumer's evoked set? Consumers
evaluate alternatives in terms of the functional and psychological benefits
that they offer. The marketing organisation needs to understand what benefits
consumers are seeking and therefore which attributes are most important in
terms of making a decision. It also needs to check other brands of the
customer‚Äôs consideration set to prepare the right plan for its own brand.

Once the alternatives have been evaluated, the consumer is ready to make a
purchase decision. Sometimes purchase intention does not result in an actual
purchase. The marketing organisation must facilitate the consumer to act on
their purchase intention. The organisation can use a variety of techniques to
achieve this. The provision of credit or payment terms may encourage purchase,
or a sales promotion such as the opportunity to receive a premium or enter a
competition may provide an incentive to buy now. The relevant internal
psychological process that is associated with purchase decision is integration.
Once the integration is achieved, the organisation can influence the purchase
decisions much more easily.
There are 5 stages of a consumer buying process _[_6_] they are: The problem
recognition stage, meaning the identification of something a consumer needs.
The search for information, which means you search your knowledge bases or
external knowledge sources for information on the product. The possibility of
alternative options, meaning whether there is another better or cheaper product
available. The choice to purchase the product and then finally the actual
purchase of the product._[_6_] This shows the complete process that a consumer
will most likely, whether recognisably or not, go through when they go to buy a
product.

The EKB (Engel, Kollat, Blackwell) model was further developed by Rice (1993)
which suggested there should be a feedback loop, Foxall (2005) further suggests
the importance of the post purchase evaluation and that it is key because of
its influences on future purchase patterns.

Consumer behaviour is influenced by internal conditions such as _d_e_m_o_g_r_a_p_h_i_c_s,
_p_s_y_c_h_o_g_r_a_p_h_i_c_s (lifestyle), _p_e_r_s_o_n_a_l_i_t_y, _m_o_t_i_v_a_t_i_o_n, knowledge, attitudes,
beliefs, and feelings. Psychological factors include an individuals motivation,
perception, attitude and belief, while personal factors include income level,
personality, age, occupation and lifestyle.
Congruence between personality and the way a persuasive message is framed
(i.e., aligning the message framing with the recipient‚Äôs personality profile)
may play an important role in ensuring the success of that message. In a recent
experiment, five advertisements (each designed to target one of the five major
trait domains of human personality) were constructed for a single product. The
results demonstrated that advertisements were evaluated more positively the
more they cohered with participants‚Äô dispositional motives._[_7_] Tailoring
persuasive messages to the personality traits of the targeted audience can be
an effective way of enhancing the messages‚Äô impact.
Behaviour can also be affected by external influences, such as _c_u_l_t_u_r_e, _s_u_b_-
_c_u_l_t_u_r_e, _l_o_c_a_l_i_t_y, royalty, _e_t_h_n_i_c_i_t_y, family, _s_o_c_i_a_l_ _c_l_a_s_s, past experience
reference groups, lifestyle, market mix factors.
