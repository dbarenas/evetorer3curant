A ccoorrppoorraattiioonn is a _s_e_p_a_r_a_t_e_ _l_e_g_a_l_ _e_n_t_i_t_y that has been incorporated through a
legislative or registration process established through legislation.
Incorporated entities have _l_e_g_a_l_ _r_i_g_h_t_s and _l_i_a_b_i_l_i_t_i_e_s that are distinct from
their employees and _s_h_a_r_e_h_o_l_d_e_r_s,_[_1_] and may conduct business as either a
_p_r_o_f_i_t-seeking _b_u_s_i_n_e_s_s or _n_o_t_ _f_o_r_ _p_r_o_f_i_t business. Early incorporated entities
were established by charter (i.e. by an ad hoc act granted by a monarch or
passed by a parliament or legislature). Most jurisdictions now allow the
creation of new corporations through registration. In addition to legal
personality, registered corporations tend to have _l_i_m_i_t_e_d_ _l_i_a_b_i_l_i_t_y, be owned
by _s_h_a_r_e_h_o_l_d_e_r_s_[_2_]_[_3_] who can transfer their _s_h_a_r_e_s to others, and controlled
by a _b_o_a_r_d_ _o_f_ _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_s who are normally elected or appointed by the
shareholders.
In _A_m_e_r_i_c_a_n_ _E_n_g_l_i_s_h the word ccoorrppoorraattiioonn is widely used to describe large
incorporated businesses._[_4_] In _B_r_i_t_i_s_h_ _E_n_g_l_i_s_h and in the commonwealth
countries, the term lliimmiitteedd ccoommppaannyy is more widely used to describe the same
sort of entity while the word ccoorrppoorraattiioonn encompasses all incorporated
entities. In American English, the word ccoommppaannyy can include entities such as
_p_a_r_t_n_e_r_s_h_i_p_s that would not be referred to as companies in British English as
they are not a _s_e_p_a_r_a_t_e_ _l_e_g_a_l_ _e_n_t_i_t_y.
Despite not being human beings, corporations, as far as the law is concerned,
are _l_e_g_a_l_ _p_e_r_s_o_n_s, and have many of the same rights and responsibilities as
natural people do. Corporations can exercise _h_u_m_a_n_ _r_i_g_h_t_s against real
individuals and the state,_[_5_]_[_6_] and they can themselves be responsible for
human rights violations._[_7_] Corporations can be "dissolved" either by statutory
operation, order of court, or voluntary action on the part of shareholders.
_I_n_s_o_l_v_e_n_c_y may result in a form of corporate failure, when creditors force the
liquidation and dissolution of the corporation under court order,_[_8_] but it
most often results in a restructuring of corporate holdings. Corporations can
even be convicted of criminal offenses, such as _f_r_a_u_d and _m_a_n_s_l_a_u_g_h_t_e_r. However
corporations are not considered living entities in the way that humans are._[_9_]

The word "corporation" derives from corpus, the _L_a_t_i_n word for body, or a "body
of people." By the time of _J_u_s_t_i_n_i_a_n (reigned 527‚Äì565), _R_o_m_a_n_ _L_a_w recognized
a range of corporate entities under the names universitas, corpus or collegium.
These included the state itself (the populus Romanus), municipalities, and such
private associations as sponsors of a _r_e_l_i_g_i_o_u_s_ _c_u_l_t, burial clubs, political
groups, and guilds of craftsmen or traders. Such bodies commonly had the right
to own property and make contracts, to receive gifts and legacies, to sue and
be sued, and, in general, to perform legal acts through representatives.
Private associations were granted designated privileges and liberties by the
emperor._[_1_0_] Entities which carried on business and were the subjects of legal
rights were found in _a_n_c_i_e_n_t_ _R_o_m_e, and the _M_a_u_r_y_a_ _E_m_p_i_r_e in ancient India._[_1_1_]
In medieval Europe, churches became incorporated, as did local governments,
such as the _P_o_p_e and the _C_i_t_y_ _o_f_ _L_o_n_d_o_n_ _C_o_r_p_o_r_a_t_i_o_n. The point was that the
incorporation would survive longer than the lives of any particular member,
existing in perpetuity. The alleged oldest commercial corporation in the world,
the _S_t_o_r_a_ _K_o_p_p_a_r_b_e_r_g mining community in _F_a_l_u_n, _S_w_e_d_e_n, obtained a _c_h_a_r_t_e_r from
King _M_a_g_n_u_s_ _E_r_i_k_s_s_o_n in 1347. Many European nations chartered corporations to
lead colonial ventures, such as the _D_u_t_c_h_ _E_a_s_t_ _I_n_d_i_a_ _C_o_m_p_a_n_y or the _H_u_d_s_o_n_'_s
_B_a_y_ _C_o_m_p_a_n_y, and these corporations came to play a large part in the history of
_c_o_r_p_o_r_a_t_e_ _c_o_l_o_n_i_a_l_i_s_m.
During the time of colonial expansion in the 17th century, the true progenitors
of the modern corporation emerged as the "chartered company". Acting under a
charter sanctioned by the Dutch government, the _D_u_t_c_h_ _E_a_s_t_ _I_n_d_i_a_ _C_o_m_p_a_n_y (VOC)
defeated _P_o_r_t_u_g_u_e_s_e forces and established itself in the _M_o_l_u_c_c_a_n_ _I_s_l_a_n_d_s in
order to profit from the _E_u_r_o_p_e_a_n demand for _s_p_i_c_e_s. Investors in the VOC were
issued paper certificates as proof of share ownership, and were able to trade
their shares on the original _A_m_s_t_e_r_d_a_m stock exchange. Shareholders are also
explicitly granted _l_i_m_i_t_e_d_ _l_i_a_b_i_l_i_t_y in the company's royal charter._[_1_2_] In the
late 18th century, _S_t_e_w_a_r_t_ _K_y_d, the author of the first treatise on _c_o_r_p_o_r_a_t_e
_l_a_w in English, defined a corporation as,
     a collection of many individuals united into one body, under a
     special denomination, having _p_e_r_p_e_t_u_a_l_ _s_u_c_c_e_s_s_i_o_n under an artificial
     form, and vested, by policy of the law, with the capacity of acting,
     in several respects, as an individual, particularly of taking and
     granting property, of contracting obligations, and of suing and being
     sued, of enjoying privileges and immunities in common, and of
     exercising a variety of political rights, more or less extensive,
     according to the design of its institution, or the powers conferred
     upon it, either at the time of its creation, or at any subsequent
     period of its existence.

In the _U_n_i_t_e_d_ _S_t_a_t_e_s, government chartering began to fall out of vogue in the
mid-19th century. Corporate law at the time was focused on protection of the
public interest, and not on the interests of corporate shareholders. Corporate
charters were closely regulated by the states. Forming a corporation usually
required an act of legislation. Investors generally had to be given an equal
say in corporate governance, and corporations were required to comply with the
purposes expressed in their charters. Many private firms in the 19th century
avoided the corporate model for these reasons (_A_n_d_r_e_w_ _C_a_r_n_e_g_i_e formed his steel
operation as a _l_i_m_i_t_e_d_ _p_a_r_t_n_e_r_s_h_i_p, and _J_o_h_n_ _D_._ _R_o_c_k_e_f_e_l_l_e_r set up _S_t_a_n_d_a_r_d_ _O_i_l
as a _t_r_u_s_t). Eventually, state governments began to realize the greater
corporate registration revenues available by providing more permissive
corporate laws. _N_e_w_ _J_e_r_s_e_y was the first state to adopt an "enabling" corporate
law, with the goal of attracting more business to the state._[_1_6_][_u_n_r_e_l_i_a_b_l_e
_s_o_u_r_c_e_?] _D_e_l_a_w_a_r_e followed, and soon became known as the most corporation-
friendly state in the country after New Jersey raised taxes on the
corporations, driving them out. New Jersey reduced these taxes after this
mistake was realized, but by then it was too late; even today, most major
public corporations in the United States are set up under Delaware law.
By the beginning of the 19th century, government policy on both sides of the
Atlantic began to change, reflecting the growing popularity of the proposition
that corporations were riding the economic wave of the future. In 1819, the U.
S. Supreme Court granted corporations a plethora of rights they had not
previously recognized or enjoyed._[_1_7_] Corporate charters were deemed
"inviolable", and not subject to arbitrary amendment or abolition by state
governments._[_1_8_] The Corporation as a whole was labeled an "artificial person",
possessing both individuality and immortality._[_1_9_]
At around the same time, legislation in the United Kingdom was similarly
freeing the corporation from historical restrictions. In 1844 the _B_r_i_t_i_s_h
_P_a_r_l_i_a_m_e_n_t passed the Joint Stock Companies Act, which allowed companies to
incorporate without a royal charter or an Act of Parliament._[_2_0_] Ten years
later, _l_i_m_i_t_e_d_ _l_i_a_b_i_l_i_t_y, the key provision of modern corporate law, passed
into English law: in response to increasing pressure from newly emerging
capital interests, Parliament passed the _L_i_m_i_t_e_d_ _L_i_a_b_i_l_i_t_y_ _A_c_t_ _1_8_5_5, which
established the principle that any corporation could enjoy limited legal
liability on both contract and tort claims simply by registering as a "limited"
company with the appropriate government agency._[_2_1_]
This prompted the English periodical _T_h_e_ _E_c_o_n_o_m_i_s_t to write in 1855 that
"never, perhaps, was a change so vehemently and generally demanded, of which
the importance was so much overrated. "_[_2_2_] The major error of the second part
of this judgment was recognised by the same magazine more than 70 years later,
when it claimed that, "[t]he economic historian of the future. . . may be
inclined to assign to the nameless inventor of the principle of limited
liability, as applied to trading corporations, a place of honour with _W_a_t_t and

The 20th century saw a proliferation of enabling law across the world, which
helped to drive economic booms in many countries before and after World War I.
Starting in the 1980s, many countries with large state-owned corporations moved
toward _p_r_i_v_a_t_i_z_a_t_i_o_n, the selling of publicly owned (or 'nationalised')
services and enterprises to corporations. _D_e_r_e_g_u_l_a_t_i_o_n (reducing the regulation
of corporate activity) often accompanied privatization as part of a _l_a_i_s_s_e_z_-
_f_a_i_r_e policy. Another major postwar shift was toward the development of
_c_o_n_g_l_o_m_e_r_a_t_e_s, in which large corporations purchased smaller corporations to
expand their industrial base. Japanese firms developed a horizontal
conglomeration model, the _k_e_i_r_e_t_s_u, which was later duplicated in other
countries as well._[_2_5_]

A corporation is, at least in theory, owned and controlled by its members. In a
_j_o_i_n_t_-_s_t_o_c_k_ _c_o_m_p_a_n_y the members are known as shareholders and each of their
shares in the ownership, control and profits of the corporation is determined
by the portion of shares in the company that they own. Thus a person who owns a
quarter of the shares of a joint-stock company owns a quarter of the company,
is entitled to a quarter of the profit (or at least a quarter of the profit
given to shareholders as dividends) and has a quarter of the votes capable of
being cast at general meetings.
In another kind of corporation the legal document which established the
corporation or which contains its current rules will determine whom the
corporation's members are. Who is a member depends on what kind of corporation
is involved. In a _w_o_r_k_e_r_ _c_o_o_p_e_r_a_t_i_v_e the members are people who work for the
cooperative. In a _c_r_e_d_i_t_ _u_n_i_o_n the members are people who have accounts with
the credit union._[_2_6_]
The day-to-day activities of a corporation is typically controlled by
individuals appointed by the members. In some cases this will be a single
individual but more commonly corporations are controlled by a committee or by
committees. Broadly speaking there are two kinds of committee structure.
    * A single committee known as a _b_o_a_r_d_ _o_f_ _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_s is the method favored in
      most _c_o_m_m_o_n_ _l_a_w countries. Under this model the board of directors is
      composed of both executive and non-executive directors, the latter being

Historically, corporations were created by a _c_h_a_r_t_e_r granted by government.
Today, corporations are usually registered with the state, province, or
national government and regulated by the laws enacted by that government.
Registration is the main prerequisite to the corporation's assumption of
limited liability. The law sometimes requires the corporation to designate its
principal address, as well as a _r_e_g_i_s_t_e_r_e_d_ _a_g_e_n_t (a person or company
designated to receive legal service of process). It may also be required to
designate an _a_g_e_n_t or other legal representative of the corporation.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n

laying out the general nature of the corporation, the amount of stock it is
authorized to issue, and the names and addresses of directors. Once the
articles are approved, the corporation's directors meet to create _b_y_l_a_w_s that
govern the internal functions of the corporation, such as meeting procedures
and officer positions.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]
The law of the jurisdiction in which a corporation operates will regulate most
of its internal activities, as well as its finances. If a corporation operates
outside its home state, it is often required to register with other governments
as a _f_o_r_e_i_g_n_ _c_o_r_p_o_r_a_t_i_o_n, and is almost always subject to laws of its host

Corporations generally have a distinct name. Historically, some corporations
were named after their membership: for instance, "The President and Fellows of
Harvard College." Nowadays, corporations in most jurisdictions have a distinct
name that does not need to make reference to their membership. In Canada, this
possibility is taken to its logical extreme: many smaller Canadian corporations
have no names at all, merely numbers based on a registration number (for
example, "12345678 Ontario Limited"), which is assigned by the provincial or
territorial government where the corporation incorporates.
In most countries, corporate names include a term or an abbreviation that
denotes the corporate status of the entity (for example, "Incorporated" or
"Inc." in the United States) or the limited liability of its members (for
example, "Limited" or "Ltd."). These terms vary by jurisdiction and language.
In some jurisdictions they are mandatory, and in others they are not._[_2_8_] Their
use puts everybody on _c_o_n_s_t_r_u_c_t_i_v_e_ _n_o_t_i_c_e that they are dealing with an entity
whose _l_i_a_b_i_l_i_t_y is limited: one can only collect from whatever assets the
entity still controls when one obtains a judgment against it.
Some jurisdictions do not allow the use of the word "ccoommppaannyy" alone to denote
corporate status, since the word "_c_o_m_p_a_n_y" may refer to a _p_a_r_t_n_e_r_s_h_i_p or some
other form of collective ownership (in the United States it can be used by a
_s_o_l_e_ _p_r_o_p_r_i_e_t_o_r_s_h_i_p but this is not generally the case elsewhere).[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n

The nature of the corporation continues to evolve in response to new situations
as existing corporations promote new ideas and structures, the courts respond,
and governments issue new regulations. A question of long standing is that of
diffused responsibility. For example, if a corporation is found liable for a
death, how should culpability and punishment for it be allocated among
shareholders, directors, management and staff, and the corporation itself? See

  28. _^^ The _U_._S_._ _s_t_a_t_e of _C_a_l_i_f_o_r_n_i_a is an example of a jurisdiction that does
      not require corporations to indicate corporate status in their names,
      except for close corporations. The drafters of the 1977 revision of the
      California General Corporation Law considered the possibility of forcing
      all California corporations to have a name indicating corporate status,
      but decided against it because of the huge number of corporations that
      would have had to change their names, and the lack of any evidence that
      anyone had been harmed in California by entities whose corporate status
      was not immediately apparent from their names. However, the 1977 drafters
      were able to impose the current disclosure requirement for close
      corporations. See Harold Marsh, Jr., R. Roy Finkle, Larry W. Sonsini, and
      Ann Yvonne Walker, Marsh's California Corporation Law, 4th ed., vol. 1
