To determine whether one must debit or credit a specific account we use the
modern accounting equation approach which consists of five accounting elements
or rules._[_4_] An alternative to this approach is to make use of the traditional
three rules of accounting for: Real accounts, Personal accounts, and Nominal
accounts to determine whether to debit or credit an account._[_5_]
In summary: an increase (+) to an asset account is a debit. An increase (+) to
a liability account is a credit. Conversely, a decrease (‚àí) to an asset
account is a credit. A decrease (‚àí) to a liability account is a debit.
Debits and credits form two opposite aspects of every _f_i_n_a_n_c_i_a_l_ _t_r_a_n_s_a_c_t_i_o_n in
double-entry bookkeeping. Debits are entered on the left side of a _l_e_d_g_e_r, and
credits are entered on the right side of a ledger. Whether a debit increases or
decreases an account depends on what kind of account it is. In the accounting
equation: Assets = Liabilities + Equity (A = L + E), if an asset account
increases (by a debit), then one must also either decrease (credit) another
asset account, or increase (credit) a liability or equity account.
For example, from a _b_a_n_k customer's perspective, when the customer deposits
cash into his bank _c_u_r_r_e_n_t_ _a_c_c_o_u_n_t (US: _c_h_e_c_k_i_n_g_ _a_c_c_o_u_n_t), this financial
transaction has two aspects: the customer's cash-in-hand (the customer's asset)
decreases and the customer's current account balance (the customer's asset)
with the bank increases. The decrease in the cash-in-hand asset is the
customer's credit while the increase in the asset balance in the bank current
account is the customer's debit.
The bank views that transaction using the same rules, but from its different
perspective. In that example, the bank's vault cash (asset) increases which is
a debit, and the corresponding increase in the customer's current account
balance (bank's liability) is a credit. This is why a customer's bank statement
issued by the bank shows the bank's liability to the customer, which increases
(bank deposits) as credits, and decreases (bank withdrawals and cheques) as
debits.

When dealing with one's own business, one must set up various accounts to
record all transactions that may take place. When the owner of a business
refers to their bank account, they are referring to the business's account, not
to their personal account. In addition, all accounts referred to in bookkeeping
belong to the business, not to other businesses, regardless of their title. For
instance, if my business expects to receive money from another person or
company and the account is labelled "Receivable A", this does nnoott imply that
the account in question belongs to "Receivable A". It is merely a recording of
a _c_u_r_r_e_n_t_ _a_s_s_e_t (a receivable) of one's own business. Therefore, when assessing
any transaction, the transaction is from the point of view of one's own
business or the business in question.
All accounts must first be classified as one of the _f_i_v_e_ _t_y_p_e_s_ _o_f_ _a_c_c_o_u_n_t_s_ 
_(_a_c_c_o_u_n_t_i_n_g_ _e_l_e_m_e_n_t_s_). To determine how to classify an account into one of the
five elements, the definitions of the five account types must be fully
understood i.e. the definition of an _a_s_s_e_t according to _I_F_R_S is as follows, "An
asset is a resource controlled by the entity as a result of past events from
which future economic benefits are expected to flow to the entity"._[_6_] To
understand this definition we can break it down into its constituent parts with
an example:
      Example: Classify what type of account the business "Bank account" is.
      The bank account of a business is "a resource controlled by the entity"
      as it belongs to the business. "As a result of past events" such as the
      opening of the business. "From which future economic benefits are
      expected to flow to the entity" ‚Äì a business such as a grocers can
      expect to make money due to the sale of their goods. This basic analogy
      can be applied to any asset account.
      All of the five accounting elements have their own definitions (discussed
      in other articles see: _a_s_s_e_t, _l_i_a_b_i_l_i_t_y, _e_q_u_i_t_y, _i_n_c_o_m_e and _e_x_p_e_n_s_e) that
      must be fully understood in order to classify an account correctly.
A business will most often have more than one asset account. An essential asset
account in any business is the business's bank account (see: "Accounts
pertaining to the five accounting elements" below for more examples) The same
applies to liability accounts i.e. if I have borrowed money from two sources
(called creditors or payables), then I must open two accounts to represent this
present liability, called 'Creditor/Payable A' and 'Creditor/Payable B'. In
this manner I may have multiple, different accounts. However all these accounts
are all classified as one of the five types of accounts, therefore my entire
business can be described in terms of its assets, expenses, liabilities, income
and equity/capital (see extended _a_c_c_o_u_n_t_i_n_g_ _e_q_u_a_t_i_o_n). This is the extent of
"my" business in relation to accounts, regardless of the business' practices
(the business may be a retail franchise, furniture shop, restaurant, etc.).
With respect to my business, each of the five accounting elements will have a
monetary value, and this can be used to assess the financial position of my
business at any time (my success, failure, or any other attributes that I might
need to know).
Traditionally, transactions are recorded in two separate columns of numbers
(known as a ledger or "T-account"): debit transactions in the left hand column
and credit transactions in the right hand column. Keeping the debits and
credits in separate columns allows each column to be recorded and totalled
independently. Accounts within the general ledger are known colloquially as "T-
accounts" due to the "T" shape that the table resembles. Each column of a
ledger account lists transactions affecting that account.
********** TTeerrmmiinnoollooggyy[[_ee_dd_ii_tt_ _ss_oo_uu_rr_cc_ee¬¬ || _ee_dd_ii_tt]] **********
Technically, in the world of accounting, the word "Debit" means the Left Side
and "Credit" means the right side. The words ddeebbiitt and ccrreeddiitt are both used
differently depending on whether they are used in a bookkeeping (accounting)
sense, or non-accounting sense.
In a non-accounting sense, "debit" is:
    * a sum of money taken from a bank account.
"credit" is
    * a sum of money placed into a bank account.
    * Money available for a client to spend.
The reason why individuals see debits and credits in the above manner, is that
the bank statement presented by the bank to the customer is the banks view of
the account and so debits and credits appear reversed. And so credit refers to
the banks view of the money, they extend credit as money placed in a customers
account appears on the credit side of a bank statement.
When recording numbers in accounting, a debit value is placed on the left side
of a ledger for a debited account and a credit value is placed on the right
side of a ledger for a credited account. A debit or a credit either increases
or decreases the total balance in each account, depending on what kind of
accounts they are.
Each transaction (say, of value ¬£100) is recorded by a debit entry of ¬£100 in
one account and a credit entry of ¬£100 in another account. When people say,
"debits must equal credits" they do not mean that the two columns of any ledger
account must be equal. If that were the case, every account would have a zero
balance (no difference between the columns) which is often not the case. The
rule that total debits equal the total credits applies when all accounts are
totalled.
More than two accounts may be affected by the same transaction. A transaction
for ¬£100 can be recorded as a ¬£100 debit in one account and as multiple
credits that total ¬£100 in other accounts.
Example:
I owe creditors A and B ¬£100 each. Thus my liability account for Creditor A
has a credit balance of ¬£100 and the same for Creditor B. I pay them off from
my bank chequing account, which from my point of view is an asset. I withdraw
¬£200 from my bank account and split it to pay off the two liabilities. In my
records, "Creditor A" is one account, "Creditor B" is another account, and
"Bank" is a third account. The following transactions affect all three-ledger
accounts:
      Dr: Creditor A (100)
      Dr: Creditor B (100)
                                                Cr: Bank (200)
When I write two ¬£100 cheques for a total of ¬£200, the balance in my bank
account is reduced by ¬£200. In my records, my "Bank" ledger account has an
asset debit balance, which is reduced by the credit for ¬£200. Amounts in my
records for the two creditors are liabilities, which are reduced by the two
debits totalling ¬£200.
Therefore for this transaction, the total amount debited = 200 and the total
amount credited = 200. When all three accounts are totalled, the total debits
equal the total credits.
At the end of any financial period (say at the end of the quarter or the year),
the total debits and the total credits for each account may be different and
this difference of the two sides is called the balance. If the sum of the debit
side is greater than the sum of the credit side, then the account has a "debit
balance". If the sum of the credit side is greater, then the account has a
"credit balance". If the two sides do equal each other (this would be a
coincidence, not as a result of the laws of accounting), then we say we have a
"zero balance".

used to make a purchase by borrowing money._[_8_]
However, from the bank's point of view, when a debit card is used to withdraw
cash from a chequing account, the withdrawal causes a decrease in the amount of
money the bank owes to the cardholder. A decrease to the bank's liability
account is a debit. Hence using a debit card causes a debit to a chequing
(liability) account in the bank. Likewise, when a credit card is used by a
cardholder to pay a merchant for something, this increases the amount the bank
must credit to the merchant's chequing account. This obligation is the bank's
liability and an increase to a liability account is a credit. Hence using a
credit card causes a credit to a liability account in the bank.

_G_e_n_e_r_a_l_ _l_e_d_g_e_r is the term for the comprehensive collection of T-accounts (so
called because there was a pre-printed vertical line in the middle of each
ledger page and a horizontal line at the top of each ledger page, like a large
letter T). Before the advent of computerised accounting, manual accounting
procedure used a book (known as a ledger) for each T-account. The collection of
all these books was called the general ledger.
"Day Books" or journals are used to list every single transaction that took
place during the day, and the list is totalled at the end of the day. These
daybooks are not part of the _d_o_u_b_l_e_-_e_n_t_r_y_ _b_o_o_k_k_e_e_p_i_n_g_ _s_y_s_t_e_m. The information
recorded in these daybooks are then transferred to the general ledgers. Modern
computer software now allows for the instant update of each ledger account ‚Äì
for example, when recording a cash receipt in a cash receipts journal a debit
is posted to a cash ledger account with a corresponding credit in the ledger
account for which the cash was received. Not every single transaction need be
entered into a T-account. Usually only the sum of the daybook transactions (a
batch total) for the day is entered in the general ledger.

There are five fundamental elements_[_4_] within accounting. These elements are as
follows: _A_s_s_e_t_s, _L_i_a_b_i_l_i_t_i_e_s, _E_q_u_i_t_y, _I_n_c_o_m_e and _E_x_p_e_n_s_e_s. Income is also
called Revenue. The five accounting elements are all affected in either a
positive or negative way. It is important to note that a credit transaction
does not always dictate a positive value or increase in a _t_r_a_n_s_a_c_t_i_o_n and
similarly, a debit does not always indicate a negative value or decrease in a
transaction. An _a_s_s_e_t account is often referred to as a "debit account" due to
the account's standard increasing attribute on the debit side. When an asset
(e.g. an espresso machine) has been acquired in a business, the transaction
will affect the debit side of that asset account illustrated below:

X            
The "X" in the debit column denotes the increasing effect of a transaction on
the asset account balance (total debits less total credits), because a debit to
an asset account is an increase. The asset account above has been added to by a
debit value X, i.e. the balance has increased by ¬£X or $X. Likewise, in the
liability account below, the X in the credit column denotes the increasing
effect on the liability account balance (total credits less total debits),
because a credit to a liability account is an increase.

Each transaction that takes place within the business will consist of at least
one debit to a specific account and at least one credit to another specific
account. A debit to one account can be balanced by more than one credit to
other accounts, and vice versa. For all transactions, the total debits must be
equal to the total credits and therefore balance.
The general _a_c_c_o_u_n_t_i_n_g_ _e_q_u_a_t_i_o_n is as follows:
      [ Assets = Equity + Liabilities ]
      [ A = E + L ]
The equation thus becomes A ‚Äì L ‚Äì E = 0 (zero). When the total debits
equals the total credits for each account, then the equation balances.
The extended _a_c_c_o_u_n_t_i_n_g_ _e_q_u_a_t_i_o_n is as follows:
      [ Assets + Expenses = Equity/Capital + Liabilities + Income ]
      [ A + Ex = E + L + I ]
Both sides of these equations must be equal (balance).
Each transaction is recorded in a _l_e_d_g_e_r or "T" account, e.g. a ledger account
named "Bank" that can be changed with either a debit or credit transaction.

Accounts are created/opened when the need arises for whatever purpose or
situation the entity may have. For example if your business is an airline
company they will have to purchase airplanes, therefore even if an account is
not listed below, a bookkeeper or accountant can create an account for a
specific item, such as an asset account for airplanes. In order to understand
how to classify an account into one of the five elements, a good understanding
of the definitions of these accounts is required. Below are examples of some of

Quick Services business purchases a computer for ¬£500, on credit, from ABC
Computers. Recognize the following transaction for Quick Services in a ledger
account (T-account):
Quick Services has acquired a new computer which is classified as an asset
within the business. According to the _a_c_c_r_u_a_l basis of accounting, even though
the computer has been purchased on credit, the computer is already the property
of Quick Services and must be recognised as such. Therefore, the equipment
account of Quick Services increases and is debited:

((ddrr)) ((ccrr))
500   
      
      
      
As the transaction for the new computer is made on credit, the payable "ABC
Computers" has not yet been paid. As a result, a liability is created within
the entity's records. Therefore, to balance the accounting equation the
corresponding liability account is credited:

     ABC Computers (Payable)     500
The journal entry "ABC Computers" is indented to indicate that this is the
credit transaction. It is accepted accounting practice to _i_n_d_e_n_t credit
transactions recorded within a journal.
In the accounting equation form:
A = E + L
500 = 0 + 500 (The accounting equation is therefore balanced)

The process of using debits and credits creates a ledger format that resembles
the letter "T"._[_9_] The term "T-account" is accounting jargon for a "ledger
account" and is often used when discussing bookkeeping._[_1_0_] The reason that a
ledger account is often referred to as a "T" account is due to the way the
account is physically drawn on paper (representing a "T"). The left side
(column) of the "T" for Debit (dr) transactions and the right side (column) of
the "T" for Credit (cr) transactions.

All accounts have corresponding contra accounts depending on what transaction
has taken place i.e. when a vehicle is purchased using cash, the asset account
"Vehicles" is debited as the vehicle account increases, and simultaneously the
asset account "Bank" is credited due to the payment of the vehicle using cash.
Some balance sheet items have corresponding contra accounts, with negative
balances, that offset them. Examples are _a_c_c_u_m_u_l_a_t_e_d_ _d_e_p_r_e_c_i_a_t_i_o_n against

Real accounts are assets. Personal accounts are liabilities and owners' equity
and represent people and entities that have invested in the business. Nominal
accounts are revenue, expenses, gains, and losses. Accountants close nominal
accounts at the end of each accounting period._[_1_1_] This method is used in the
United Kingdom, where it is simply known as the _T_r_a_d_i_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _a_p_p_r_o_a_c_h._[_5_]
Transactions are recorded by a debit to one account and a credit to another
account using these three "golden rules of accounting":
   1. Real account: Debit what comes in and credit what goes out
   2. Personal account: Debit who receives and Credit who gives.
   3. Nominal account: Debit all expenses & losses and Credit all incomes &
      gains

While the actual origin of the terms debit and credit is unknown, the first
known recorded use of the terms is Venetian _L_u_c_a_ _P_a_c_i_o_l_i's 1494 work, Summa de
Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et Proportionalita (translated: Everything
About Arithmetic, Geometry and Proportion). Pacioli devoted one section of his
book to documenting and describing the _d_o_u_b_l_e_-_e_n_t_r_y_ _b_o_o_k_k_e_e_p_i_n_g system in use
during the _R_e_n_a_i_s_s_a_n_c_e by Venetian merchants, traders and bankers. This system
is still the fundamental system in use by modern bookkeepers._[_1_2_]
In its original Latin, Pacioli's Summa used the Latin words _d_e_b_e_r_e (to owe) and
_c_r_e_d_e_r_e (to entrust) to describe the two sides of a closed accounting
transaction. When his work was translated, the Latin words debere and credere
became the English debit and credit. The abbreviations Dr (for debit) and Cr
(for credit) likely derive from the original Latin._[_1_3_]
