EElleeccttrroonniicc ccoommmmeerrccee, commonly known as ee--ccoommmmeerrccee, is a type of industry where
the buying and selling of products or services is conducted over electronic
systems such as the Internet and other computer networks. Electronic commerce
draws on technologies such as _m_o_b_i_l_e_ _c_o_m_m_e_r_c_e, _e_l_e_c_t_r_o_n_i_c_ _f_u_n_d_s_ _t_r_a_n_s_f_e_r,

_W_i_d_e_ _W_e_b at least at one point in the transaction's life-cycle, although it may
encompass a wider range of technologies such as e-mail, _m_o_b_i_l_e_ _d_e_v_i_c_e_s social
media, and telephones as well.
Electronic commerce is generally considered to be the sales aspect of e-
business. It also consists of the exchange of data to facilitate the financing
and payment aspects of business transactions. This is an effective and
efficient way of communicating within an organization and one of the most
effective and useful ways of conducting business.
E-commerce can be divided into:
    * E-tailing or "virtual storefronts" on websites with online catalogs,
      sometimes gathered into a "virtual mall"
    * Buying or Selling on various websites
    * The gathering and use of demographic data through Web contacts and social
      media
    * Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), the business-to-business exchange of
      data
    * E-mail and fax and their use as media for reaching prospective and
      established customers (for example, with newsletters)

_[_2_3_] Using its authority under Section 5 of the FTC Act, which prohibits unfair
or deceptive practices, the FTC has brought a number of cases to enforce the
promises in corporate privacy statements, including promises about the security
of consumers' personal information._[_2_4_] As result, any corporate privacy policy
related to e-commerce activity may be subject to enforcement by the FTC.

Network (ICPEN), which was formed in 1991 from an informal network of
government customer fair trade organisations. The purpose was stated as being
to find ways of co-operating on tackling consumer problems connected with
cross-border transactions in both goods and services, and to help ensure
exchanges of information among the participants for mutual benefit and
understanding. From this came econsumer, as an initiative of ICPEN since April
2001. www.econsumer.gov is a portal to report complaints about online and
related transactions with foreign companies.

competent authority for most aspects of the Payment Services Directive (PSD).
The UK implemented the PSD through the Payment Services Regulations 2009
(PSRs), which came into effect on 1 November 2009. The PSR affects firms
providing payment services and their customers. These firms include banks, non-
bank credit card issuers and non-bank merchant acquirers, e-money issuers, etc.
The PSRs created a new class of regulated firms known as payment institutions
(PIs), who are subject to prudential requirements. Article 87 of the PSD
requires the European Commission to report on the implementation and impact of
the PSD by 1 November 2012._[_3_2_]

Contemporary electronic commerce involves everything from ordering "digital"
content for immediate online consumption, to ordering conventional goods and
services, to "meta" services to facilitate other types of electronic commerce.
On the institutional level, big corporations and financial institutions use the
internet to exchange financial data to facilitate domestic and international
business. Data integrity and security are very hot and pressing issues for
electronic commerce.
Aside from traditional e-Commerce, m-Commerce as well as the nascent t-Commerce
_[_3_3_] channels are often seen as the current 2013 poster children of electronic
I-Commerce.

expand. With 384 million internet users, China's online shopping sales rose to

the improved trust level for shoppers. The Chinese retailers have been able to
help consumers feel more comfortable shopping online._[_3_6_] eCommerce is also
expanding across the Middle East. Having recorded the world's fastest growth in

Economists have theorized that e-commerce ought to lead to intensified price
_c_o_m_p_e_t_i_t_i_o_n, as it increases consumers' ability to gather information about
products and prices. Research by four economists at the University of Chicago
has found that the growth of online shopping has also affected industry
structure in two areas that have seen significant growth in e-commerce,
_b_o_o_k_s_h_o_p_s and _t_r_a_v_e_l_ _a_g_e_n_c_i_e_s. Generally, larger firms are able to use
_e_c_o_n_o_m_i_e_s_ _o_f_ _s_c_a_l_e and offer lower prices. The lone exception to this pattern
