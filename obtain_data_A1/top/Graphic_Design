GGrraapphhiicc ddeessiiggnn is a creative process, one most often involving a client and a
designer, and traditionally completed in conjunction with producers of form
(printers, sign makers, etc.). Graphic design is undertaken to convey a
specific message (or messages) to a targeted audience, usually from the client,
known as the 'brief'. The term "graphic design" can also refer to a number of
artistic and professional disciplines that focus on visual communication and
presentation. The field as a whole is also often referred to as _V_i_s_u_a_l
_C_o_m_m_u_n_i_c_a_t_i_o_n or _C_o_m_m_u_n_i_c_a_t_i_o_n_ _D_e_s_i_g_n. Various methods are used to create and
combine words, symbols, and images to create a visual representation of ideas
and messages. A graphic designer may use a combination of _t_y_p_o_g_r_a_p_h_y, _v_i_s_u_a_l
_a_r_t_s and _p_a_g_e_ _l_a_y_o_u_t techniques to produce a balanced, focused and symmetrical
final result. Graphic design often refers to both the process (designing) by
which the communication is created and the products (designs) which are
generated.
Common uses of graphic design include identity (logos and branding),
publications (magazines, newspapers and books), print advertisements, posters,
billboards, website graphics and elements, signs and product packaging. For
example, a product package might include a logo or other artwork, organized
text and pure design elements such as images, shapes and color which unify the
piece. _C_o_m_p_o_s_i_t_i_o_n is one of the most important features of graphic design,
especially when using pre-existing materials or diverse elements.

While Graphic Design as a discipline has a relatively recent history, with the
term "graphic design" first coined by _W_i_l_l_i_a_m_ _A_d_d_i_s_o_n_ _D_w_i_g_g_i_n_s in 1922,_[_2_]
graphic design-like activities span the history of humankind: from the caves of
_L_a_s_c_a_u_x, to Rome's _T_r_a_j_a_n_'_s_ _C_o_l_u_m_n to the _i_l_l_u_m_i_n_a_t_e_d_ _m_a_n_u_s_c_r_i_p_t_s of the Middle
Ages, to the dazzling neons of _G_i_n_z_a. In both this lengthy history and in the
relatively recent explosion of _v_i_s_u_a_l_ _c_o_m_m_u_n_i_c_a_t_i_o_n in the 20th and 21st
centuries, there is sometimes a blurring distinction and over-lapping of
_a_d_v_e_r_t_i_s_i_n_g art, graphic design and _f_i_n_e_ _a_r_t. After all, they share many of the
same elements, theories, principles, practices and _l_a_n_g_u_a_g_e_s, and sometimes the
same benefactor or client. In _a_d_v_e_r_t_i_s_i_n_g art the ultimate objective is the
sale of goods and services. In graphic design, "the essence is to give order to
information, form to ideas, expression and feeling to artifacts that document
human experience."_[_3_]

During the _T_a_n_g_ _D_y_n_a_s_t_y (618‚Äì907) between the 7th and 9th century AD, wood
blocks were cut to print on textiles and later to reproduce Buddhist texts. A
Buddhist scripture printed in 868 is the earliest known printed book. Beginning
in the 11th century, longer scrolls and books were produced using movable type
printing making books widely available during the Song dynasty (960‚Äì1279)._[_4_]
Sometime around 1450, _J_o_h_a_n_n_ _G_u_t_e_n_b_e_r_g's printing press made books widely
available in Europe. The book design of _A_l_d_u_s_ _M_a_n_u_t_i_u_s developed the book
structure which would become the foundation of western publication design. This
era of graphic design is called _H_u_m_a_n_i_s_t or Old Style.

In late 19th-century Europe, especially in the United Kingdom, the movement
began to separate graphic design from fine art.
In 1849, _H_e_n_r_y_ _C_o_l_e became one of the major forces in design education in Great
Britain, informing the government of the importance of design in his Journal of
Design and Manufactures. He organized the _G_r_e_a_t_ _E_x_h_i_b_i_t_i_o_n as a celebration of
modern industrial technology and Victorian design.
From 1891 to 1896, _W_i_l_l_i_a_m_ _M_o_r_r_i_s' Kelmscott Press published books that are
some of the most significant of the graphic design products of the _A_r_t_s_ _a_n_d
_C_r_a_f_t_s_ _m_o_v_e_m_e_n_t, and made a very lucrative business of creating books of great
stylistic refinement and selling them to the wealthy for a premium. Morris
proved that a market existed for works of graphic design in their own right and
helped pioneer the separation of design from production and from fine art. The
work of the Kelmscott Press is characterized by its obsession with historical
styles. This historicism was, however, important as it amounted to the first
significant reaction to the stale state of nineteenth-century graphic design.
Morris' work, along with the rest of the _P_r_i_v_a_t_e_ _P_r_e_s_s movement, directly
influenced _A_r_t_ _N_o_u_v_e_a_u and is indirectly responsible for developments in early
twentieth century graphic design in general._[_5_]

The name "Graphic Design" first appeared in print in the 1922 essay "New Kind
of Printing Calls for New Design" by _W_i_l_l_i_a_m_ _A_d_d_i_s_o_n_ _D_w_i_g_g_i_n_s, an American book
designer in the early 20th century._[_6_]
Raffe's Graphic Design, published in 1927, is considered to be the first book
to use "Graphic Design" in its title._[_7_]
The signage in the _L_o_n_d_o_n_ _U_n_d_e_r_g_r_o_u_n_d is a classic design example_[_8_] of the
modern era and used a typeface designed by Edward Johnston in 1916.
In the 1920s, Soviet _c_o_n_s_t_r_u_c_t_i_v_i_s_m applied 'intellectual production' in
different spheres of production. The movement saw individualistic art as
useless in revolutionary Russia and thus moved towards creating objects for
utilitarian purposes. They designed buildings, theater sets, posters, fabrics,
clothing, furniture, logos, menus, etc.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]
_J_a_n_ _T_s_c_h_i_c_h_o_l_d codified the principles of _m_o_d_e_r_n_ _t_y_p_o_g_r_a_p_h_y in his 1928 book,
New Typography. He later repudiated the philosophy he espoused in this book as
being fascistic, but it remained very influential.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] Tschichold,
_B_a_u_h_a_u_s typographers such as _H_e_r_b_e_r_t_ _B_a_y_e_r and _L_√_°_s_z_l_√_≥_ _M_o_h_o_l_y_-_N_a_g_y, and _E_l
_L_i_s_s_i_t_z_k_y have greatly influenced graphic design as we know it today. They
pioneered production techniques[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] and stylistic devices used
throughout the twentieth century. The following years saw graphic design in the
modern style gain widespread acceptance and application._[_9_] A booming post-
World War II American economy established a greater need for graphic design,
mainly advertising and packaging. The emigration of the German _B_a_u_h_a_u_s school
of design to Chicago in 1937 brought a "mass-produced" minimalism to America;
sparking a wild fire of "modern" architecture and design. Notable names in mid-
century modern design include _A_d_r_i_a_n_ _F_r_u_t_i_g_e_r, designer of the _t_y_p_e_f_a_c_e_s
_U_n_i_v_e_r_s and _F_r_u_t_i_g_e_r; _P_a_u_l_ _R_a_n_d, who, from the late 1930s until his death in
1996, took the principles of the Bauhaus and applied them to popular
advertising and logo design, helping to create a uniquely American approach to
European minimalism while becoming one of the principal pioneers of the subset
of graphic design known as _c_o_r_p_o_r_a_t_e_ _i_d_e_n_t_i_t_y; and _J_o_s_e_f_ _M_√_º_l_l_e_r_-_B_r_o_c_k_m_a_n_n, who
designed posters in a severe yet accessible manner typical of the 1950s and
1970s era.
The growth of the professional graphic design industry has grown in parallel
with the rise of _c_o_n_s_u_m_e_r_i_s_m. This has raised some concerns and criticisms,
notably from within the graphic design community with the _F_i_r_s_t_ _T_h_i_n_g_s_ _F_i_r_s_t
_m_a_n_i_f_e_s_t_o. First launched by _K_e_n_ _G_a_r_l_a_n_d in 1964, it was re-published as the
_F_i_r_s_t_ _T_h_i_n_g_s_ _F_i_r_s_t_ _2_0_0_0_ _m_a_n_i_f_e_s_t_o in 1999 in the magazine _E_m_i_g_r_e 51_[_1_0_] stating
"We propose a reversal of priorities in favor of more useful, lasting and
democratic forms of communication - a mindshift away from product marketing and
toward the exploration and production of a new kind of meaning. The scope of
debate is shrinking; it must expand. Consumerism is running uncontested; it
must be challenged by other perspectives expressed, in part, through the visual
languages and resources of design."_[_1_1_] Both editions attracted signatures from
respected design practitioners and thinkers, for example; _R_u_d_y_ _V_a_n_d_e_r_L_a_n_s, _E_r_i_k
_S_p_i_e_k_e_r_m_a_n_n, _E_l_l_e_n_ _L_u_p_t_o_n and _R_i_c_k_ _P_o_y_n_o_r. The 2000 manifesto was also notably
published in _A_d_b_u_s_t_e_r_s, known for its strong critiques of visual culture.

From _r_o_a_d_ _s_i_g_n_s to technical schematics, from interoffice _m_e_m_o_r_a_n_d_u_m_s to
reference _m_a_n_u_a_l_s, graphic design enhances transfer of _k_n_o_w_l_e_d_g_e and visual
messages. _R_e_a_d_a_b_i_l_i_t_y and _l_e_g_i_b_i_l_i_t_y is enhanced by improving the visual
presentation and layout of text.
Design can also aid in selling a _p_r_o_d_u_c_t or _i_d_e_a through effective visual
communication. It is applied to products and elements of company identity like
_l_o_g_o_s, colors, _p_a_c_k_a_g_i_n_g, and text. Together these are defined as _b_r_a_n_d_i_n_g (see
also _a_d_v_e_r_t_i_s_i_n_g). Branding has increasingly become important in the range of
services offered by many graphic designers, alongside _c_o_r_p_o_r_a_t_e_ _i_d_e_n_t_i_t_y.
Whilst the terms are often used interchangeably, branding is more strictly
related to the identifying mark or trade name for a product or service, whereas
corporate identity can have a broader meaning relating to the structure and
ethos of a company, as well as to the company's external image. Graphic
designers will often form part of a team working on corporate identity and
branding projects. Other members of that team can include marketing
professionals, communications consultants and commercial writers.
Textbooks are designed to present subjects such as geography, science, and
math. These publications have layouts which illustrate _t_h_e_o_r_i_e_s and _d_i_a_g_r_a_m_s. A
common example of graphics in use to educate is diagrams of _h_u_m_a_n_ _a_n_a_t_o_m_y.
Graphic design is also applied to layout and formatting of educational material
to make the information more accessible and more readily understandable.
Graphic design is applied in the _e_n_t_e_r_t_a_i_n_m_e_n_t industry in decoration, scenery,
and visual story telling. Other examples of design for entertainment purposes
include novels, comic books, DVD covers, _o_p_e_n_i_n_g_ _c_r_e_d_i_t_s and _c_l_o_s_i_n_g_ _c_r_e_d_i_t_s in
_f_i_l_m_m_a_k_i_n_g, and programs and props on stage. This could also include artwork
used for t-shirts and other items screenprinted for sale.
From scientific journals to news reporting, the presentation of opinion and
facts is often improved with graphics and thoughtful compositions of visual
information - known as _i_n_f_o_r_m_a_t_i_o_n_ _d_e_s_i_g_n. Newspapers, magazines, blogs,
television and film documentaries may use graphic design to inform and
entertain. With the advent of the web, _i_n_f_o_r_m_a_t_i_o_n_ _d_e_s_i_g_n_e_r_s with experience in
interactive tools such as _A_d_o_b_e_ _F_l_a_s_h are increasingly being used to illustrate
the background to news stories.

existing _t_e_x_t and either preexisting _i_m_a_g_e_r_y or images developed by the graphic
designer. For example, a newspaper story begins with the journalists and
photojournalists and then becomes the graphic designer's job to organize the
page into a reasonable layout and determine if any other graphic elements
should be required. In a magazine article or advertisement, often the graphic
designer or art director will commission photographers or illustrators to
create original pieces just to be incorporated into the design layout. Or the
designer may utilize stock imagery or photography. Contemporary design practice
has been extended to the modern computer, for example in the use of _W_Y_S_I_W_Y_G
user interfaces, often referred to as _i_n_t_e_r_a_c_t_i_v_e_ _d_e_s_i_g_n, or _m_u_l_t_i_m_e_d_i_a design.

Before any graphic elements may be applied to a design, the graphic elements
must be originated by means of visual art skills. These graphics are often (but
not always) developed by a graphic designer. Visual arts include works which
are primarily _v_i_s_u_a_l in nature using anything from _t_r_a_d_i_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _m_e_d_i_a, to
photography or _d_i_g_i_t_a_l_ _a_r_t. Graphic design principles may be applied to each
graphic art element individually as well as to the final composition.

Typography is the art, craft and techniques of type design, modifying type
_g_l_y_p_h_s, and arranging type. Type glyphs (characters) are created and modified
using a variety of illustration techniques. The arrangement of type is the
selection of typefaces, point size, tracking (the space between all characters
used), kerning (the space between two specific characters), and leading (line
spacing).
Typography is performed by typesetters, compositors, typographers, graphic
artists, art directors, and clerical workers. Until the Digital Age, typography
was a specialized occupation. Digitization opened up typography to new
generations of visual designers and lay users.

The page layout aspect of graphic design deals with the arrangement of elements
(content) on a page, such as image placement, and text layout and style.
Beginning from early _i_l_l_u_m_i_n_a_t_e_d pages in hand-copied books of the _M_i_d_d_l_e_ _A_g_e_s
and proceeding down to intricate modern magazine and catalogue layouts,
structured page design has long been a consideration in printed material. With
print media, elements usually consist of _t_y_p_e (text), _i_m_a_g_e_s (pictures), and
occasionally place-holder graphics for elements that are not printed with ink
such as _d_i_e/_l_a_s_e_r_ _c_u_t_t_i_n_g, _f_o_i_l_ _s_t_a_m_p_i_n_g or _b_l_i_n_d_ _e_m_b_o_s_s_i_n_g.

Since the advent of the _W_o_r_l_d_ _W_i_d_e_ _W_e_b and computer software development, many
graphic designers have become involved in interface design. This has included
_w_e_b_ _d_e_s_i_g_n and _s_o_f_t_w_a_r_e_ _d_e_s_i_g_n, when _e_n_d_ _u_s_e_r _i_n_t_e_r_a_c_t_i_v_i_t_y is a design

Printmaking is the process of making artworks by printing on _p_a_p_e_r and other
materials or surfaces. Except in the case of monotyping, the process is capable
of producing multiples of the same piece, which is called a print. Each piece
is not a copy but an original since it is not a reproduction of another work of
art and is technically known as an impression. Painting or drawing, on the
other hand, create a unique original piece of artwork. Prints are created from
a single original surface, known technically as a matrix. Common types of
matrices include: plates of metal, usually copper or zinc for engraving or
etching; stone, used for lithography; blocks of wood for woodcuts, linoleum for
linocuts and fabric plates for screen-printing. But there are many other kinds,
discussed below. Works printed from a single plate create an edition, in modern
times usually each signed and numbered to form a limited edition. Prints may
also be published in book form, as artist's books. A single print could be the
product of one or multiple techniques.

The _p_e_n_c_i_l is one of the most basic graphic design tools.
The mind is an important graphic design tool. Aside from technology, graphic
design requires _j_u_d_g_m_e_n_t and _c_r_e_a_t_i_v_i_t_y. Critical, observational, quantitative
and analytic thinking are required for design layouts and _r_e_n_d_e_r_i_n_g. If the
executor is merely following a solution (e.g. sketch, script or instructions)
provided by another designer (such as an _a_r_t_ _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r), then the executor is
not usually considered the designer.
The method of presentation (e.g. arrangement, style, medium) may be equally
important to the design. The appropriate development and presentation tools can
substantially change how an audience perceives a project. The image or layout
is produced using external _t_r_a_d_i_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _m_e_d_i_a and _g_u_i_d_e_s, or _d_i_g_i_t_a_l_ _i_m_a_g_e
_e_d_i_t_i_n_g tools on computers. Tools in computer graphics often take on
traditional names such as "scissors" or "pen." Some graphic design tools such
as a _g_r_i_d are used in both traditional and digital form.
In the mid-1980s, the arrival of _d_e_s_k_t_o_p_ _p_u_b_l_i_s_h_i_n_g and _g_r_a_p_h_i_c_ _a_r_t_ _s_o_f_t_w_a_r_e
_a_p_p_l_i_c_a_t_i_o_n_s introduced a generation of designers to computer image
manipulation and creation that had previously been manually executed. Computer
graphic design enabled designers to instantly see the effects of layout or
typographic changes, and to simulate the effects of traditional media without
requiring a lot of space. However, traditional tools such as _p_e_n_c_i_l_s or _m_a_r_k_e_r_s
are useful even when computers are used for finalization; a designer or art
director may hand sketch numerous concepts as part of the _c_r_e_a_t_i_v_e_ _p_r_o_c_e_s_s.
Some of these sketches may even be shown to a client for early stage approval,
before the designer develops the idea further using a computer and graphic
design software tools.
_C_o_m_p_u_t_e_r_s are considered an indispensable tool in the graphic design industry.
Computers and _s_o_f_t_w_a_r_e_ _a_p_p_l_i_c_a_t_i_o_n_s are generally seen by _c_r_e_a_t_i_v_e
_p_r_o_f_e_s_s_i_o_n_a_l_s as more effective production tools than traditional methods.
However, some designers continue to use manual and traditional tools for
production, such as _M_i_l_t_o_n_ _G_l_a_s_e_r.
New ideas can come by way of experimenting with tools and methods. Some
designers explore ideas using pencil and paper._[_1_2_] Others use many different
mark-making tools and resources from computers to sculpture as a means of
inspiring creativity. One of the key features of graphic design is that it
makes a tool out of appropriate image selection in order to possibly convey
meaning._[_1_3_]

There is some debate whether computers enhance the creative process of graphic
design._[_1_4_] Rapid production from the computer allows many designers to explore
multiple ideas quickly with more detail than what could be achieved by
traditional hand-rendering or _p_a_s_t_e_-_u_p on paper, moving the designer through
the creative process more quickly._[_1_5_] However, being faced with limitless
choices does not help isolate the best design solution and can lead to endless
iterations with no clear design outcome.
A graphic designer may use _s_k_e_t_c_h_e_s to explore multiple or complex ideas
quickly_[_1_6_] without the distractions and complications of software.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n
_n_e_e_d_e_d] Hand-rendered _c_o_m_p_s are often used to get approval for an idea
execution before a designer invests time to produce finished visuals on a
computer or in paste-up. The same _t_h_u_m_b_n_a_i_l sketches or rough drafts on paper
may be used to rapidly refine and produce the idea on the computer in a hybrid
process. This hybrid process is especially useful in _l_o_g_o design_[_1_7_] where a
software _l_e_a_r_n_i_n_g_ _c_u_r_v_e may detract from a creative thought process. The
traditional-design/computer-production hybrid process may be used for freeing
one's creativity in _p_a_g_e_ _l_a_y_o_u_t or _i_m_a_g_e_ _d_e_v_e_l_o_p_m_e_n_t as well.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]
In the early days of computer publishing, many "traditional" graphic designers
relied on computer-savvy _p_r_o_d_u_c_t_i_o_n_ _a_r_t_i_s_t_s to produce their ideas from
sketches, without needing to learn the computer skills themselves. However,
this practice has been increasingly less common since the advent of _d_e_s_k_t_o_p
_p_u_b_l_i_s_h_i_n_g over 30 years ago. The use of computers and graphics software is now
taught in most graphic design courses.
Nearly all of the popular and "industry standard" software programs used for
graphic design since the early 1990s are products of _A_d_o_b_e_ _S_y_s_t_e_m_s
Incorporated. They are Adobe _P_h_o_t_o_s_h_o_p (a raster-based program for photo
editing), _A_d_o_b_e_ _I_l_l_u_s_t_r_a_t_o_r (a vector-based program for drawing), _A_d_o_b_e
_I_n_D_e_s_i_g_n (a page layout program), and _A_d_o_b_e_ _D_r_e_a_m_w_e_a_v_e_r (for Web page design).
Another major page layout tool is _Q_u_a_r_k_X_p_r_e_s_s (a product of Quark, Inc., a
separate company from Adobe). Both _Q_u_a_r_k_X_p_r_e_s_s and _A_d_o_b_e_ _I_n_D_e_s_i_g_n are often
used in the final stage of the electronic design process. Raster images may
have been edited in Adobe Photoshop, logos and illustrations in Adobe
Illustrator, and the final product assembled in one of the major page layout
programs. Most graphic designers entering the field since about 1990 are
expected to be proficient in at least one or two of these programs.

overlap. The main job responsibility of a Graphic Designer is the arrangement
of visual elements in some type of media. The main job titles within the
industry can vary and are often country specific. They can include _g_r_a_p_h_i_c

_a_r_t_i_s_t. Depending on the industry served, the responsibilities may have
different titles such as "_D_T_P_ _A_s_s_o_c_i_a_t_e" or "_G_r_a_p_h_i_c_ _A_r_t_i_s_t", but despite
changes in title, graphic design principles remain consistent. The
responsibilities may come from, or lead to, specialized skills such as
_i_l_l_u_s_t_r_a_t_i_o_n, _p_h_o_t_o_g_r_a_p_h_y or _i_n_t_e_r_a_c_t_i_v_e_ _d_e_s_i_g_n. Today's graduating graphic
design students are normally exposed to all of these areas of graphic design
and urged to become familiar with all of them as well in order to be
competitive.
Graphic designers can work in a variety of environments. Whilst many will work
within companies devoted specifically to the industry, such as design
consultancies or branding agencies, others may work within publishing,
marketing or other communications companies. Increasingly, especially since the
introduction of personal computers to the industry, many graphic designers have
found themselves working within non-design oriented organizations, as in-house
designers. Graphic designers may also work as free-lance designers, working on
their own terms, prices, ideas, etc.
A graphic designer reports to the _a_r_t_ _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r, _c_r_e_a_t_i_v_e_ _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r or _s_e_n_i_o_r
_m_e_d_i_a_ _c_r_e_a_t_i_v_e. As a designer becomes more senior, they may spend less time
designing media and more time leading and directing other designers on broader
creative activities, such as _b_r_a_n_d development and _c_o_r_p_o_r_a_t_e_ _i_d_e_n_t_i_t_y
development. They are often expected to interact more directly with clients,
for example taking and interpreting briefs.
