In 2005 the United Nations reported that there were nearly 191 million
international migrants worldwide, about 3 percent of the world population._[_5_]
This represented a rise of 26 million since 1990. 60 percent of these
immigrants were now in developed countries, an increase on 1990. Those in less
developed countries stagnated, mainly because of a fall in refugees._[_6_]
Contrast that to the average rate of globalization (the proportion of cross-
border trade in all trade), which exceeds 20 percent. The numbers of people
living outside their country of birth is expected to rise in the future._[_7_]

immigrant censuses is low due to the concealed character of undocumented labor
migration.

to another country in the world if they had the chance to._[_8_] Nearly one-
quarter (23%) of these respondents, which translates to more than 150 million
adults worldwide, named the United States as their desired future residence,
while an additional 7% of respondents, representing an estimated 45 million,
chose the United Kingdom. The other top desired destination countries (those
where an estimated 25 million or more adults would like to go) were Canada,
France, Saudi Arabia, Australia, Germany and Spain.

Netherlandsâ€™ largest ethnic minority, are beginning to return to Turkey,
taking with them the education and skills they have acquired abroad, as the
Netherlands faces challenges from economic difficulties, social tension and
increasingly powerful far-right parties. At the same time Turkeyâ€™s political,
social and economic conditions have been improving, making returning home all
the more appealing for Turks at large (pp. 94â€“99).

_L_o_n_d_o_n has become multiracial as a result of immigration._[_9_] Across large parts

One theory of immigration distinguishes between Push and Pull._[_1_1_] Push factors
refer primarily the motive for immigration from the country of origin. In the
case of economic migration (usually labor migration), differentials in _w_a_g_e
_r_a_t_e_s are usual. If the value of wages in the new country surpasses the value
of wages in oneâ€™s native country, he or she may choose to migrate as long as
the costs are not too high. Particularly in the 19th century, economic
expansion of the U.S. increased immigrant flow, and in effect, nearly 20% of
the population was _f_o_r_e_i_g_n_ _b_o_r_n versus todayâ€™s values of 10%, making up a
significant amount of the labor force. Poor individuals from less developed
countries can have far higher standards of living in developed countries than
in their originating countries. The cost of emigration, which includes both the
explicit costs, the ticket price, and the implicit cost, lost work time and
loss of community ties, also play a major role in the pull of emigrants away
from their native country. As transportation technology improved, travel time
and costs decreased dramatically between the 18th and early 20th century.
Travel across the Atlantic used to take up to 5 weeks in the 18th century, but
around the time of the 20th century it took a mere 8 days._[_1_2_] When the
_o_p_p_o_r_t_u_n_i_t_y_ _c_o_s_t is lower, the immigration rates tend to be higher._[_1_2_] Escape
from _p_o_v_e_r_t_y (personal or for relatives staying behind) is a traditional push
factor, the availability of _j_o_b_s is the related pull factor. _N_a_t_u_r_a_l_ _d_i_s_a_s_t_e_r_s
can amplify poverty-driven migration flows. This kind of migration may be
_i_l_l_e_g_a_l_ _i_m_m_i_g_r_a_t_i_o_n in the destination country.
Managed by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC), _H_a_r_m_o_n_y_ _D_a_y is
intended to celebrate the cohesive and inclusive nature of _A_u_s_t_r_a_l_i_a and
promote a tolerant and culturally diverse society.
Emigration and immigration are sometimes mandatory in a contract of employment:
religious _m_i_s_s_i_o_n_a_r_i_e_s, and employees of _t_r_a_n_s_n_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _c_o_r_p_o_r_a_t_i_o_n_s,
international _n_o_n_-_g_o_v_e_r_n_m_e_n_t_a_l_ _o_r_g_a_n_i_z_a_t_i_o_n_s and the _d_i_p_l_o_m_a_t_i_c_ _s_e_r_v_i_c_e expect,
by definition, to work 'overseas'. They are often referred to as '_e_x_p_a_t_r_i_a_t_e_s',
and their conditions of employment are typically equal to or better than those
applying in the host country (for similar work).
For some migrants, _e_d_u_c_a_t_i_o_n is the primary pull factor (although most
_i_n_t_e_r_n_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _s_t_u_d_e_n_t_s are not classified as immigrants). _R_e_t_i_r_e_m_e_n_t migration
from rich countries to lower-cost countries with better _c_l_i_m_a_t_e is a new type
of international migration. Examples include immigration of retired _B_r_i_t_i_s_h
citizens to _S_p_a_i_n or _I_t_a_l_y and of retired _C_a_n_a_d_i_a_n citizens to the _U_._S_. (mainly
to the U.S. states of _F_l_o_r_i_d_a and _T_e_x_a_s).
Non-economic push factors include _p_e_r_s_e_c_u_t_i_o_n (religious and otherwise),
frequent abuse, _b_u_l_l_y_i_n_g, _o_p_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n, _e_t_h_n_i_c_ _c_l_e_a_n_s_i_n_g and even _g_e_n_o_c_i_d_e, and
risks to civilians during _w_a_r. Political motives traditionally motivate refugee
flowsâ€”to escape _d_i_c_t_a_t_o_r_s_h_i_p for instance.
Some migration is for personal reasons, based on a _r_e_l_a_t_i_o_n_s_h_i_p (e.g. to be
with family or a partner), such as in _f_a_m_i_l_y_ _r_e_u_n_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n or _t_r_a_n_s_n_a_t_i_o_n_a_l
_m_a_r_r_i_a_g_e (especially in the instance of a _g_e_n_d_e_r_ _i_m_b_a_l_a_n_c_e). Recent research
has found gender, age, and cross-cultural differences in the ownership of the
idea to immigrate (for more, click _h_e_r_e)._[_1_3_] In a few cases, an individual may
wish to immigrate to a new country in a form of transferred _p_a_t_r_i_o_t_i_s_m. Evasion
of _c_r_i_m_i_n_a_l_ _j_u_s_t_i_c_e (e.g. avoiding _a_r_r_e_s_t) is a personal motivation. This type
of emigration and immigration is not normally legal, if a crime is
internationally recognized, although criminals may disguise their identities or
find other loopholes to evade detection. There have been cases, for example, of
those who might be guilty of war crimes disguising themselves as victims of war
or conflict and then pursuing asylum in a different country.
Barriers to immigration come not only in legal form; natural and social
barriers to immigration can also be very powerful. Immigrants when leaving
their country also leave everything familiar: their family, friends, support
network, and culture. They also need to liquidate their assets often at a large
loss,[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] and incur the expense of moving. When they arrive in a
new country this is often with many uncertainties including finding work, where
to live, new laws, new cultural norms, language or accent issues, possible
_r_a_c_i_s_m and other exclusionary behavior towards them and their family. These
barriers act to limit international migration (scenarios where populations move
en masse to other continents, creating huge population surges, and their
associated strain on infrastructure and services, ignore these inherent limits

"It is one of the ironies of post-war European history that, once the freedom
to travel for _E_u_r_o_p_e_a_n_s living under communist regimes, which had long been
demanded by the West, was finally granted in 1989/90, travel was very soon
afterwards made much more difficult by the West itself, and new barriers were
erected to replace the Iron Curtain." â€”Anita BÃ¶cker_[_1_4_]
The politics of immigration have become increasingly associated with other
issues, such as _n_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _s_e_c_u_r_i_t_y, _t_e_r_r_o_r_i_s_m, and in western Europe especially,
with the presence of _I_s_l_a_m as a new major religion. Those with security
concerns cite the _2_0_0_5_ _c_i_v_i_l_ _u_n_r_e_s_t_ _i_n_ _F_r_a_n_c_e that point to the _J_y_l_l_a_n_d_s_-_P_o_s_t_e_n

immigration has become an emotional political issue in many European nations.

Studies have suggested that some _s_p_e_c_i_a_l_ _i_n_t_e_r_e_s_t_ _g_r_o_u_p_s _l_o_b_b_y for less
immigration for their own group and more immigration for other groups since
they see effects of immigration, such as increased labor competition, as
detrimental when affecting their own group but beneficial when affecting other
groups. A 2010 European study suggested that "that employers are more likely to
be pro-immigration than employees, provided that immigrants are thought to
compete with employees who are already in the country. Or else, when immigrants
are thought to compete with employers rather than employees, employers are more
likely to be anti-immigration than employees."_[_1_5_] A 2011 study examining the
voting of US representatives on migration policy suggests that "that
representatives from more skilled labor abundant districts are more likely to
support an open immigration policy towards the unskilled, whereas the opposite
is true for representatives from more unskilled labor abundant districts."_[_1_6_]
Another contributing factor may be lobbying by earlier immigrants. The Chairman
for the US Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform which lobby for more permissive
rules for immigrants, as well as special arrangements just for Irish, has
stated that "the Irish Lobby will push for any special arrangement it can get
â€” 'as will every other ethnic group in the country.'"_[_1_7_]_[_1_8_]

As a principle, citizens of one member nation of the _E_u_r_o_p_e_a_n_ _U_n_i_o_n are allowed
to work in other member nations with little to no restriction on movement._[_1_9_]

in the EU, movement between EU-member states is considerably more difficult.
After 155 new waves of accession to the European Union, earlier members have
often introduced measures to restrict participation in "their" labour markets
by citizens of the new EU-member states. For instance, Austria, Belgium,
Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal and
Spain each restricted their labor market for up to seven years both in the 2004
and 2007 round of accession._[_2_0_]

relatively low levels of labour immigration until recently (and which have
often sent a significant portion of their population overseas in the past) are
now seeing an influx of immigrants from EU countries with lower per capita
annual earning rates, triggering nationwide immigration debates._[_2_1_]_[_2_2_] _S_p_a_i_n,
meanwhile, is seeing growing illegal immigration from _A_f_r_i_c_a. As Spain is the
closest EU member nation to Africaâ€”Spain even has two autonomous cities
(_C_e_u_t_a and _M_e_l_i_l_l_a) on the African continent, as well as an autonomous
community (the _C_a_n_a_r_y_ _I_s_l_a_n_d_s) west of North Africa, in the Atlanticâ€”it is
physically easiest for African emigrants to reach. This has led to debate both
within Spain and between Spain and other EU members. Spain has asked for border
control assistance from other EU states; the latter have responded that Spain
has brought the wave of African illegal migrants on itself by granting amnesty
to hundreds of thousands of undocumented foreigners._[_2_3_]

end of World War II and have been debating the issue for decades. Foreign
workers were brought in to those countries to help rebuild after the war, and
many stayed. Political debates about immigration typically focus on statistics,
the immigration law and policy, and the implementation of existing
restrictions._[_2_4_]_[_2_5_] In some European countries the debate in the 1990s was
focused on asylum seekers, but restrictive policies within the European Union,
as well as a reduction in armed conflict in Europe and neighboring regions,
have sharply reduced asylum seekers._[_2_6_]
Some states, such as _J_a_p_a_n, have opted for technological changes to increase
profitability (for example, greater _a_u_t_o_m_a_t_i_o_n), and designed immigration laws
specifically to prevent immigrants from coming to, and remaining within, the
country. Globalization, as well as low birth rates and an aging work force, has
forced Japan to reconsider its immigration policy._[_2_7_] Japan's colonial past
has also created considerable number of non-Japanese in Japan. Japan keeps
tight control on immigration and in 2009, despite generous overseas aid for
refugees, granted political asylum to just 30 people._[_2_8_] Japanese Minister

The term economic migrant refers to someone who has emigrated from one region
to another region for the purposes of seeking employment or improved financial
position. An economic migrant is distinct from someone who is a _r_e_f_u_g_e_e fleeing
persecution.
Many countries have immigration and visa restrictions that prohibit a person
entering the country for the purposes of gaining work without a valid work
visa. Persons who are declared an economic migrant can be refused entry into a
country.
The process of allowing immigrants into a particular country has been believed
to have effects on wages and employment. Particularly the lower skilled workers
are affected directly, but evidence suggests that this is due to adjustments
within industries._[_3_1_]

Treatment of migrants in host countries, both by governments, employers, and
original population, is a topic of continual debate and criticism, as many
cases of abuse and violation of rights are being reported frequently. Some
countries have developed a particularly notorious reputation regarding
treatment of migrants. The _U_n_i_t_e_d_ _N_a_t_i_o_n_s_ _C_o_n_v_e_n_t_i_o_n_ _o_n_ _t_h_e_ _P_r_o_t_e_c_t_i_o_n_ _o_f_ _t_h_e

(1966), the freedom only applies to movement within national borders: it may be
guaranteed by the _c_o_n_s_t_i_t_u_t_i_o_n or by human rights legislation. Additionally,
this freedom is often limited to _c_i_t_i_z_e_n_s and excludes others.
No _s_o_v_e_r_e_i_g_n_ _s_t_a_t_e currently allows full freedom of movement across its borders
[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d], except Uruguay[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d], and international _h_u_m_a_n
_r_i_g_h_t_s treaties do not confer a general right to enter another state[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n
_n_e_e_d_e_d]. Proponents of immigration maintain that, according to Article 13 of
the _U_n_i_v_e_r_s_a_l_ _D_e_c_l_a_r_a_t_i_o_n_ _o_f_ _H_u_m_a_n_ _R_i_g_h_t_s, everyone has the right to leave or
enter a country, along with movement within it (internal migration), although
article 13 actually restricts freedom of movement to "within the borders of
each state." Additionally, the UDHR does not mention entry into other countries
when it states that "everyone has the right to leave any country, including his
own, and to return to his country."_[_3_3_] Some argue that the freedom of movement
both within and between countries is a basic human right, and that the
restrictive immigration policies, typical of nation-states, violate this human
right of freedom of movement._[_3_4_] Such arguments are common among anti-state
ideologies like _a_n_a_r_c_h_i_s_m and _l_i_b_e_r_t_a_r_i_a_n_i_s_m. As philosopher and "Open Borders"
activist _J_a_c_o_b_ _A_p_p_e_l has written, "Treating human beings differently, simply
because they were born on the opposite side of a national boundary, is hard to
justify under any mainstream philosophical, religious or ethical theory."_[_3_5_]
However, Article 14 does provide that "everyone has the right to seek and to
enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution."_[_3_6_]
Where immigration is permitted, it is typically selective. _F_a_m_i_l_y_ _r_e_u_n_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n
accounts for approximately two-thirds of legal immigration to the US every
year._[_3_7_] Ethnic selection, such as the _W_h_i_t_e_ _A_u_s_t_r_a_l_i_a_ _p_o_l_i_c_y, has generally
disappeared, but priority is usually given to the educated, skilled, and
wealthy. Less privileged individuals, including the mass of poor people in low-
income countries, cannot avail themselves of the legal and protected
immigration opportunities offered by wealthy states. This inequality has also
been criticized as conflicting with the principle of _e_q_u_a_l_ _o_p_p_o_r_t_u_n_i_t_i_e_s, which
apply (at least in theory) within democratic nation-states. The fact that the
door is closed for the unskilled, while at the same time many developed
countries have a huge demand for unskilled labor, is a major factor in _i_l_l_e_g_a_l
_i_m_m_i_g_r_a_t_i_o_n. The contradictory nature of this policyâ€”which specifically
disadvantages the unskilled immigrants while exploiting their laborâ€”has also
been criticized on ethical grounds.
Immigration policies which selectively grant freedom of movement to targeted
individuals are intended to produce a net economic gain for the host country.
They can also mean net loss for a poor donor country through the loss of the
educated minorityâ€”the _b_r_a_i_n_ _d_r_a_i_n. This can exacerbate the _g_l_o_b_a_l_ _i_n_e_q_u_a_l_i_t_y
in _s_t_a_n_d_a_r_d_s_ _o_f_ _l_i_v_i_n_g that provided the motivation for the individual to
migrate in the first place. One example of competition for skilled labour is
active recruitment of _h_e_a_l_t_h_ _w_o_r_k_e_r_s from the _T_h_i_r_d_ _W_o_r_l_d by _F_i_r_s_t_ _W_o_r_l_d

physical violence against their wives if they "misbehave"; and wives are
expected, both legally and socially, to "obey" their husbands._[_3_8_]_[_3_9_] Various

Conservative denominationsâ€”not secularâ€”though Reform and Conservative
conversions must take place outside the state, similar to civil marriages) the
right to immigrate to Israel. A 1970 amendment, extended immigration rights to
"a child and a grandchild of a Jew, the spouse of a Jew, the spouse of a child
of a Jew and the spouse of a grandchild of a Jew". Over a million Jews from the

_J_a_p_a_n's population is very homogeneous because of the tight control it has had
on immigration.
In the early 1990s, Japan relaxed its relatively tight immigration laws to
allow special entry permits for foreigners of _J_a_p_a_n_e_s_e ancestry in _S_o_u_t_h
_A_m_e_r_i_c_a to make up for a labor shortage._[_5_6_] According to Japanese immigration
centre,_[_5_7_] the number of foreign residents in Japan has steadily increased,
and the number of foreign residents (including _p_e_r_m_a_n_e_n_t_ _r_e_s_i_d_e_n_t_s, but

staying less than 90 days in Japan_[_5_8_]) was more than 2.2 million in 2008._[_5_7_]
The biggest groups are _K_o_r_e_a_n_s (both south and north), Chinese (including
_C_h_i_n_a, _T_a_i_w_a_n, _H_o_n_g_ _K_o_n_g, _M_a_c_a_u nationalities), and Brazilians. Most of the
Brazilians in Japan have _J_a_p_a_n_e_s_e ancestry due to the huge Japanese immigration
to Brazil in the first decades of the 20th century. Immediately after _W_o_r_l_d_ _W_a_r

the Korean Peninsula._[_5_9_]
Among the immigrants, Japan accepts a steady flow of 15,000 new Japanese
citizens by naturalization (å¸°åŒ–, kika_?) per year._[_6_0_] Indeed, the concept of
ethnic groups by the Japanese statistics is different from that used in North
American or some Western European statistics. For example, _t_h_e_ _U_n_i_t_e_d_ _K_i_n_g_d_o_m
Census asks about its citizens' "ethnic or racial background"._[_6_1_] The Japanese
Statistics Bureau does not ask this question. Since the Japanese census asks
about nationality rather than ethnicity, naturalized Japanese citizens and
Japanese nationals with multi-ethnic backgrounds are considered simply to be
_J_a_p_a_n_e_s_e in the population of Japan._[_5_7_]
According to the Japanese Association for Refugees, the number of _r_e_f_u_g_e_e_s who
applied to live in Japan has rapidly increased since 2006,_[_6_2_] and there were
more than a thousand applications in 2008._[_6_2_] Japan's refugee policy has been
criticized because the number of refugees accepted into Japan is small compared
to countries such as _S_w_e_d_e_n and the United States._[_6_3_] For example, according
to the _U_N_H_C_R, in 1999 Japan accepted 16 refugees for resettlement, while the
_U_n_i_t_e_d_ _S_t_a_t_e_s took in 85,010, and _N_e_w_ _Z_e_a_l_a_n_d (which has a much smaller

Some EU member states are currently receiving large-scale immigration: for
instance _S_p_a_i_n, where the economy has created more than the whole of all the
new jobs in the EU over the past five years._[_6_8_] The EU, in 2005, had an
overall net gain from international migration of +1.8 million people. This
accounts for almost 85% of Europe's total population growth in 2005._[_6_9_] In
2004, total 140,033 people immigrated to _F_r_a_n_c_e. Of them, 90,250 were from
_A_f_r_i_c_a and 13,710 from _E_u_r_o_p_e._[_7_0_] In 2005, immigration fell slightly to

relevance. Citizens from the European Union make up a growing proportion of
immigrants in _S_p_a_i_n. They mainly come from countries like the UK and Germany,
but the British case is of special interest due to its magnitude. The British
authorities estimate that the British population in Spain at 700,000._[_7_2_] Mid-
and long term EU demographics indicate a shortage of skilled laborers on a
scale that would endanger economic growth and the stability of numerous
industries. For this reason the European Union launched an initiative called
the EU Blue Card, In 2009. The EU Blue Card is initially a temporary residence
and work permit. However it will offer holders the opportunity to apply for a
permanent resident permit after working on an EU Blue Card for two to five
years uninterrupted, depending on individual member state regulations.

Italy now has an estimated 4 million to 4.5 million immigrants â€” about 8
percent of the population. Since the expansion of the European Union, the most
recent wave of migration has been from surrounding European nations,
particularly Central Europe, and increasingly Asia, replacing North Africa as
the major immigration area. Some 997,000 Romanians are officially registered as
living in Italy, replacing Albanians (590,000) and Moroccans (455,000) as the
largest ethnic minority group, but independent estimates put the actual number
of Romanians at double that figure or perhaps even more. Other immigrants from
Central and Eastern Europe are Ukrainians (260,000), Polish (120,000),
Moldovans (190 000) Macedonians (100,000), Serbs (75,000), Bulgarians
(124,000), Bosnians (40,000), Russians (45,600), Croatians (25,000), Slovaks
(9,000), Hungarians (8,600). As of 2009, the foreign born population origin of
Italy was subdivided as follows: Europe (53.5%), Africa (22.3%), Asia (15.8%),
the Americas (8.1%) and Oceania (0.06%). The distribution of foreign born
population is largely uneven in Italy: 80% of immigrants live in the northern
and central parts of the country (the most economically developed areas), while
only 20% live in the southern half of the peninsula. In 2008, net immigration
to Italy was 47,000.

After the United States returned to a more closed border, immigration has been

move to Mexico. However, the program was not found successful and many
immigrants were deported against their will. Last year alone, 400,000 Mexican
immigrants were repatriated. In 2010 alone, there was a total of 139,120 legal
immigrants who migrated to the United States. This put Mexico as the top
country for emigration _[_9_5_] According to recent studies, the amount of
immigrants migrating from Mexico should continue to increase tremendously each

United States increased from 2.2 million to 14.2 million. The highest
percentage of foreign born people in the United States was found in this
period, with the peak in 1890 at 14.7%. During this time, the lower costs of
Atlantic Ocean travel in time and fare made it more advantageous for immigrants
to move to the U.S. than in years prior. From 1880 to 1924, over 25 million
Europeans migrated to the United States._[_1_0_3_]

      committed while exercising a legal right; examples of legal rights
      include: "The punishment of a wife by her husband, the disciplining by
      parents and teachers of children under their authority within certain
      limits prescribed by law or by custom"._[_4_]
  39. _^^ in Yemen marriage regulations state that a wife must obey her husband
      and must not leave home without his permission._[_5_]
  40. _^^ In Jordan, part of article 340 of the Penal Code states that "he who
      discovers his wife or one of his female relatives committing adultery and
      kills, wounds, or injures one of them, is exempted from any penalty."
      Article 98 of the Penal Code is often cited alongside Article 340 in
      cases of honor killings. "Article 98 stipulates that a reduced sentence
      is applied to a person who kills another person in a 'fit of fury'".
