_[_1_] often in the context of a business or other enterprise._[_2_] The term is
commonly used as a synonym for computers and computer networks, but it also
encompasses other information distribution technologies such as television and
telephones. Several _i_n_d_u_s_t_r_i_e_s are associated with information technology, such
as _c_o_m_p_u_t_e_r_ _h_a_r_d_w_a_r_e, _s_o_f_t_w_a_r_e, _e_l_e_c_t_r_o_n_i_c_s, _s_e_m_i_c_o_n_d_u_c_t_o_r_s, _i_n_t_e_r_n_e_t, _t_e_l_e_c_o_m

In a business context, the _I_n_f_o_r_m_a_t_i_o_n_ _T_e_c_h_n_o_l_o_g_y_ _A_s_s_o_c_i_a_t_i_o_n_ _o_f_ _A_m_e_r_i_c_a has
defined information technology as "the study, design, development, application,
implementation, support or management of computer-based information systems".
_[_5_] The responsibilities of those working in the field include network
administration, software development and installation, and the planning and
management of an organization's technology life cycle, by which hardware and
software is maintained, upgraded and replaced.
Humans have been storing, retrieving, manipulating and communicating
information since the _S_u_m_e_r_i_a_n_s in _M_e_s_o_p_o_t_a_m_i_a developed _w_r_i_t_i_n_g in about
3000 BC,_[_6_] but the term "information technology" in its modern sense first
appeared in a 1958 article published in the _H_a_r_v_a_r_d_ _B_u_s_i_n_e_s_s_ _R_e_v_i_e_w; authors
Harold J. Leavitt and Thomas L. Whisler commented that "the new technology does
not yet have a single established name. We shall call it information technology
(IT)."_[_7_] Based on the storage and processing technologies employed, it is
possible to distinguish four distinct phases of IT development: pre-mechanical
(3000 BC â€“ 1450 AD), mechanical (1450â€“1840), electromechanical
(1840â€“1940) and electronic (1940â€“present)._[_6_] This article focuses on the
most recent period (electronic), which began in about 1940.

Devices have been used to aid computation for thousands of years, probably
initially in the form of a _t_a_l_l_y_ _s_t_i_c_k._[_8_] The _A_n_t_i_k_y_t_h_e_r_a_ _m_e_c_h_a_n_i_s_m, dating
from about the beginning of the first century BC, is generally considered to be
the earliest known mechanical _a_n_a_l_o_g_ _c_o_m_p_u_t_e_r; it is also the earliest known
geared mechanism._[_9_] Comparable geared devices did not emerge in Europe until
the 16th century,_[_1_0_] and it was not until 1645 that the first mechanical
calculator capable of performing the four basic arithmetical operations was
developed._[_1_1_]
Electronic computers, using either relays or valves, began to appear in the
early 1940s. The electromechanical _Z_u_s_e_ _Z_3, completed in 1941, was the world's
first _p_r_o_g_r_a_m_m_a_b_l_e computer, and by modern standards one of the first machines
that could be considered a complete computing machine. _C_o_l_o_s_s_u_s, developed
during the Second World War to decrypt _G_e_r_m_a_n messages was the first _e_l_e_c_t_r_o_n_i_c
_d_i_g_i_t_a_l computer. Although it was _p_r_o_g_r_a_m_m_a_b_l_e, it was not general-purpose,
being designed to perform only a single task. It also lacked the ability to
store its program in memory. Instead, programming was carried out using plugs
and switches to alter the internal wiring._[_1_2_] The first recognisably modern
electronic digital _s_t_o_r_e_d_-_p_r_o_g_r_a_m_ _c_o_m_p_u_t_e_r was the _M_a_n_c_h_e_s_t_e_r_ _S_m_a_l_l_-_S_c_a_l_e

Early electronic computers such as _C_o_l_o_s_s_u_s made use of _p_u_n_c_h_e_d_ _t_a_p_e, a long
strip of paper on which data was represented by a series of holes, a technology
now obsolete._[_1_4_] Electronic data storage, which is used in modern computers,
dates from the _S_e_c_o_n_d_ _W_o_r_l_d_ _W_a_r, when a form of _d_e_l_a_y_ _l_i_n_e_ _m_e_m_o_r_y was developed
to remove the clutter from _r_a_d_a_r signals, the first practical application of
which was the mercury delay line._[_1_5_] The first _r_a_n_d_o_m_-_a_c_c_e_s_s digital storage
device was the _W_i_l_l_i_a_m_s_ _t_u_b_e, based on a standard _c_a_t_h_o_d_e_ _r_a_y_ _t_u_b_e,_[_1_6_] but the
information stored in it and delay line memory was volatile in that it had to
be continuously refreshed, and thus was lost once power was removed. The
earliest form of non-volatile computer storage was the _m_a_g_n_e_t_i_c_ _d_r_u_m, invented
in 1932_[_1_7_] and used in the _F_e_r_r_a_n_t_i_ _M_a_r_k_ _1, the world's first commercially
available general-purpose electronic computer._[_1_8_]
Most digital data today is still stored magnetically on devices such as _h_a_r_d
_d_i_s_k_ _d_r_i_v_e_s, or optically on media such as _C_D_-_R_O_M_s._[_1_9_] It has been estimated
that the worldwide capacity to store information on electronic devices grew
from less than 3 _e_x_a_b_y_t_e_s in 1986 to 295 exabytes in 2007,_[_2_0_] doubling roughly
every 3 years._[_2_1_]

Database management systems emerged in the 1960s to address the problem of
storing and retrieving large amounts of data accurately and quickly. One of the
earliest such systems was _I_B_M's _I_n_f_o_r_m_a_t_i_o_n_ _M_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t_ _S_y_s_t_e_m (IMS),_[_2_2_] which
is still widely deployed more than 40 years later._[_2_3_] IMS stores data
_h_i_e_r_a_r_c_h_i_c_a_l_l_y,_[_2_2_] but in the 1970s _T_e_d_ _C_o_d_d proposed an alternative
relational storage model based on _s_e_t_ _t_h_e_o_r_y and _p_r_e_d_i_c_a_t_e_ _l_o_g_i_c and the
familiar concepts of tables, rows and columns. The first commercially available
_r_e_l_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _d_a_t_a_b_a_s_e_ _m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t_ _s_y_s_t_e_m (RDBMS) was available from _O_r_a_c_l_e in
1980._[_2_4_]
All database management systems consist of a number of components that together
allow the data they store to be accessed simultaneously by many users while
maintaining its integrity. A characteristic of all databases is that the
structure of the data they contain is defined and stored separately from the
data itself, in a _d_a_t_a_b_a_s_e_ _s_c_h_e_m_a._[_2_2_]
The _e_x_t_e_n_s_i_b_l_e_ _m_a_r_k_u_p_ _l_a_n_g_u_a_g_e (XML) has become a popular format for data
representation in recent years. Although XML data can be stored in normal _f_i_l_e
_s_y_s_t_e_m_s, it is commonly held in _r_e_l_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _d_a_t_a_b_a_s_e_s to take advantage of their
"robust implementation verified by years of both theoretical and practical
effort"._[_2_5_] As an evolution of the _S_t_a_n_d_a_r_d_ _G_e_n_e_r_a_l_i_z_e_d_ _M_a_r_k_u_p_ _L_a_n_g_u_a_g_e

and human-readable._[_2_6_]

The terms "data" and "information" are not synonymous. Anything stored is data,
but it only becomes information when it is organised and presented
meaningfully._[_2_7_] Most of the world's digital data is unstructured, and stored
in a variety of different physical formats_[_2_8_]_[_a_] even within a single
organization. _D_a_t_a_ _w_a_r_e_h_o_u_s_e_s began to be developed in the 1980s to integrate
these disparate stores. They typically contain data extracted from various
sources, including external sources such as the Internet, organised in such a
way as to facilitate _d_e_c_i_s_i_o_n_ _s_u_p_p_o_r_t_ _s_y_s_t_e_m_s (DSS)._[_2_9_]

Data transmission has three aspects: transmission, propagation, and reception.
_[_3_0_]
XML has been increasingly employed as a means of data interchange since the
early 2000s,_[_3_1_] particularly for machine-oriented interactions such as those
involved in web-oriented _p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l_s such as _S_O_A_P,_[_2_6_] describing "data-in-
transit rather than ... data-at-rest"._[_3_1_] One of the challenges of such usage

Hilbert and Lopez_[_2_0_] identify the exponential pace of technological change (a
kind of _M_o_o_r_e_'_s_ _l_a_w): machines' application-specific capacity to compute
information per capita roughly doubled every 14 months between 1986 and 2007;
the per capita capacity of the world's general-purpose computers doubled every
18 months during the same two decades; the global telecommunication capacity
per capita doubled every 34 months; the world's storage capacity per capita
required roughly 40 months to double (every 3 years); and per capita broadcast
information has doubled every 12.3 years._[_2_0_]
Massive amounts of data are stored worldwide every day, but unless it can be
analysed and presented effectively it essentially resides in what have been
called data tombs: "data archives that are seldom visited"._[_3_3_] To address that
issue, the field of _d_a_t_a_ _m_i_n_i_n_g â€“ "the process of discovering interesting
patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data"_[_3_4_] â€“ emerged in the late
1980s._[_3_5_]

   4. _^^ On the later more broad application of the term IT, Keary comments- "In
      its original application 'information technology' was appropriate to
      describe the convergence of technologies with application in the broad
      field of data storage, retrieval, processing, and dissemination. This
      useful conceptual term has since been converted to what purports to be
      concrete use, but without the reinforcement of definition...the term IT
      lacks substance when applied to the name of any function, discipline, or
      position." Anthony Ralston (2000). _E_n_c_y_c_l_o_p_e_d_i_a_ _o_f_ _c_o_m_p_u_t_e_r_ _s_c_i_e_n_c_e.
