activity designed to add value and improve an organization's operations. It
helps an organization accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic,

catalyst for improving an organization's governance, risk management and
management controls by providing insight and recommendations based on analyses
and assessments of data and business _p_r_o_c_e_s_s_e_s. With commitment to _i_n_t_e_g_r_i_t_y
and _a_c_c_o_u_n_t_a_b_i_l_i_t_y, internal auditing provides value to _g_o_v_e_r_n_i_n_g_ _b_o_d_i_e_s and
_s_e_n_i_o_r_ _m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t as an objective source of independent advice. Professionals
called internal _a_u_d_i_t_o_r_s are employed by organizations to perform the internal
auditing activity.
The scope of internal auditing within an organization is broad and may involve
topics such as an organization's governance, risk management and management
controls over: efficiency/effectiveness of operations (including safeguarding
of assets), the reliability of financial and management reporting, and
_c_o_m_p_l_i_a_n_c_e with laws and regulations. Internal auditing may also involve
conducting proactive fraud audits to identify potentially fraudulent acts;
participating in fraud investigations under the direction of fraud
investigation professionals, and conducting post investigation fraud audits to
identify control breakdowns and establish financial loss.
Internal auditors are not responsible for the execution of company activities;
they _a_d_v_i_s_e management and the _B_o_a_r_d_ _o_f_ _D_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_s (or similar _o_v_e_r_s_i_g_h_t body)
regarding how to better execute their _r_e_s_p_o_n_s_i_b_i_l_i_t_i_e_s. As a result of their
broad scope of involvement, internal auditors may have a variety of higher
educational and professional backgrounds.
The Institute of Internal Auditors (_I_I_A) is the recognized international
standard setting body for the internal audit profession and awards the
Certified Internal Auditor designation internationally through rigorous written
examination. Other designations are available in certain countries._[_2_] In the
United States the professional standards of the Institute of Internal Auditors
have been codified in several states' statutes pertaining to the practice of
internal auditing in government (New York State, Texas, and Florida being three
examples). There are also a number of other international standard setting
bodies.
Internal auditors work for government agencies (federal, state and local); for
publicly traded companies; and for non-profit companies across all industries.
Internal auditing departments are led by a _C_h_i_e_f_ _A_u_d_i_t_ _E_x_e_c_u_t_i_v_e ("CAE") who

The Internal Auditing profession evolved steadily with the progress of
_m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t_ _s_c_i_e_n_c_e after World War II. It is conceptually similar in many ways
to _f_i_n_a_n_c_i_a_l_ _a_u_d_i_t_i_n_g by _p_u_b_l_i_c_ _a_c_c_o_u_n_t_i_n_g firms, _q_u_a_l_i_t_y_ _a_s_s_u_r_a_n_c_e and banking
compliance activities. While some of the audit technique underlying internal
auditing is derived from _m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t_ _c_o_n_s_u_l_t_i_n_g and public accounting
professions, the theory of internal auditing was conceived primarily by
Lawrence Sawyer (1911-2002), often referred to as "the father of modern
internal auditing";_[_3_] and the current philosophy, theory and practice of
modern internal auditing as defined by the International Professional Practices
Framework (IPPF) of the Institute of Internal Auditors owes much to Sawyer's
vision.
With the implementation in the United States of the _S_a_r_b_a_n_e_s_-_O_x_l_e_y_ _A_c_t of 2002,
the profession's exposure and value was enhanced, as many internal auditors
possessed the skills required to help companies meet the requirements of the
law. However, the focus by internal audit departments of publicly traded
companies on SOX related financial policy and procedures derailed progress made
by the profession in the late 20th century toward Larry Sawyer's vision for
internal audit. Beginning in about 2010, the IIA once again began advocating
for the broader role internal auditing should play in the corporate arena, in
keeping with the IPPF's philosophy._[_4_]

While internal auditors are not independent of the companies that employ them,
independence and objectivity are a cornerstone of the IIA professional
standards; and are discussed at length in the standards and the supporting
practice guides and practice advisories. Professional internal auditors are
mandated by the IIA standards to be independent of the business activities they
audit. This independence and objectivity are achieved through the
organizational placement and reporting lines of the internal audit department.
Internal auditors of publicly traded companies in the United States are
required to report functionally to the board of directors directly, or a sub-
committee of the board of directors (typically the audit committee), and not to
management except for administrative purposes.
The required _o_r_g_a_n_i_z_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _i_n_d_e_p_e_n_d_e_n_c_e from _m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t enables unrestricted
_e_v_a_l_u_a_t_i_o_n of management activities and personnel and allows internal _a_u_d_i_t_o_r_s
to perform their role effectively. Although internal auditors are part of
company management and paid by the company, the primary customer of internal
_a_u_d_i_t activity is the entity charged with _o_v_e_r_s_i_g_h_t of management's activities.
This is typically the _A_u_d_i_t_ _C_o_m_m_i_t_t_e_e, a sub-committee of the _B_o_a_r_d_ _o_f
_D_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_s. To provide independence, most _C_h_i_e_f_ _A_u_d_i_t_ _E_x_e_c_u_t_i_v_e_s report to the
Chairperson of the Audit Committee and can only be replaced with the
concurrence of that individual.

Internal auditing activity is primarily directed at evaluating _i_n_t_e_r_n_a_l
_c_o_n_t_r_o_l. Under the _C_O_S_O Framework, internal control is broadly defined as a
process, effected by an entity's board of directors, management, and other
personnel, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement
of the following core objectives for which all businesses strive:
    * Effectiveness and efficiency of operations.
    * Reliability of financial and management reporting.
    * Compliance with laws and regulations.
    * Safeguarding of Assets
Management is responsible for internal control, which comprises five critical
components: the control environment; risk assessment; risk focused control
activities; information and communication; and monitoring activities. Managers
establish policies, processes, and practices in these five components of
management control to help the organization achieve the four specific
objectives listed above. Internal auditors perform audits to evaluate whether
the five components of management control are present and operating
effectively, and if not, provide recommendations for improvement.
In the _U_n_i_t_e_d_ _S_t_a_t_e_s, internal auditors may assist management with compliance
with the _S_a_r_b_a_n_e_s_-_O_x_l_e_y_ _A_c_t (SOX).

Internal auditing professional standards require the function to evaluate the
effectiveness of the organization's _R_i_s_k_ _m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t activities. Risk management
is the process by which an organization identifies, analyzes, responds, gathers
information about, and monitors strategic risks that could actually or
potentially impact the organization's ability to achieve its mission and
objectives.
Under the _C_O_S_O enterprise risk management (ERM) Framework, an organization's
strategy, operations, reporting, and compliance objectives all have associated
strategic business risks - the negative outcomes resulting from internal and
external events that inhibit the organization's ability to achieve its
objectives. Management assesses risk as part of the ordinary course of business
activities such as strategic planning, marketing planning, capital planning,
budgeting, hedging, incentive payout structure, credit/lending practices,
mergers and acquisitions, strategic partnerships, legislative changes,
conducting business abroad, etc. _S_a_r_b_a_n_e_s_-_O_x_l_e_y regulations require extensive
risk assessment of financial reporting processes. Corporate legal counsel often
prepares comprehensive assessments of the current and potential litigation a
company faces. Internal auditors may evaluate each of these activities, or
focus on the overarching process used to manage risks entity-wide. For example,
internal auditors can advise management regarding the reporting of forward-
looking operating measures to the Board, to help identify emerging risks; or
internal auditors can evaluate and report on whether the board and other
stakeholders can have reasonable assurance the organization's management team
has implemented an effective enterprise risk management program.
In larger organizations, major strategic initiatives are implemented to achieve
objectives and drive changes. As a member of senior management, the Chief Audit
Executive (CAE) may participate in status updates on these major initiatives.
This places the CAE in the position to report on many of the major risks the
organization faces to the Audit Committee, or ensure management's reporting is

past been generally informal, accomplished primarily through participation in
meetings and discussions with members of the Board of Directors. According to
COSO's ERM framework, governance is the policies, processes and structures used
by the organization‚Äôs leadership to direct activities, achieve objectives,
and protect the interests of diverse stakeholder groups in a manner consistent
with ethical standards. The internal auditor is often considered one of the
"four pillars" of corporate governance, the other pillars being the Board of
Directors, management, and the external auditor._[_7_]
A primary focus area of internal auditing as it relates to corporate governance
is helping the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (or equivalent)
perform its responsibilities effectively. This may include reporting critical
management control issues, suggesting questions or topics for the Audit
Committee's meeting agendas, and coordinating with the external auditor and
management to ensure the Committee receives effective information. In recent
years, the IIA has advocated more formal evaluation of Corporate governance,
particularly in the areas of board oversight of enterprise risk, corporate
ethics, and fraud.

Based on a _r_i_s_k_ _a_s_s_e_s_s_m_e_n_t of the organization, internal auditors, management
and oversight Boards determine where to focus internal auditing efforts. This
focus or prioritization is part of the annual/multi-year audit planning. The
audit plan is typically proposed by the CAE (sometimes with several options or
alternatives) for the review and approval of the Audit Committee or Board of
Directors. Internal auditing activity is generally conducted as one or more
discrete assignments. A typical internal audit assignment _[_8_] involves the
following steps:
   1. Establish and communicate the scope and objectives for the audit to
      appropriate management.
   2. Develop an understanding of the business area under review. This includes
      objectives, measurements, and key transaction types. This involves review
      of documents and interviews. Flowcharts and narratives may be created if
      necessary.
   3. Describe the key risks facing the business activities within the scope of
      the audit.
   4. Identify management practices in the five components of control used to
      ensure each key risk is properly controlled and monitored.
   5. Develop and execute a risk-based sampling and testing approach to
      determine whether the most important management controls are operating as
      intended.
   6. Report issues and challenges identified and negotiate action plans with
      management to address the problems.
   7. Follow-up on reported findings at appropriate intervals. Internal audit
      departments maintain a follow-up database for this purpose.
Audit assignment length varies based on the complexity of the activity being
audited and Internal Audit resources available. Many of the above steps are
iterative and may not all occur in the sequence indicated.
In addition to assessing business processes, specialists called Information
Technology (IT) Auditors review _i_n_f_o_r_m_a_t_i_o_n_ _t_e_c_h_n_o_l_o_g_y_ _c_o_n_t_r_o_l_s_.

Internal auditors typically issue reports at the end of each audit that
summarize their findings, recommendations, and any responses or action plans
from management. An audit report may have an executive summary; a body that
includes the specific issues or findings identified and related recommendations
or action plans; and appendix information such as detailed graphs and charts or
process information. Each audit finding within the body of the report may
contain five elements, sometimes called the "5 C's":
   1. Condition: What is the particular problem identified?
   2. Criteria: What is the standard that was not met? The standard may be a
      company policy or other benchmark.
   3. Cause: Why did the problem occur?
   4. Consequence: What is the risk/negative outcome (or opportunity foregone)
      because of the finding?
   5. Corrective action: What should management do about the finding? What have
      they agreed to do and by when?
The recommendations in an internal audit report are designed to help the
organization achieve effective and efficient governance, risk and control
processes associated with operations objectives, financial and management
reporting objectives; and legal/regulatory compliance objectives.
Audit findings and recommendations may also relate to particular assertions
about transactions, such as whether the transactions audited were valid or
authorized, completely processed, accurately valued, processed in the correct
time period, and properly disclosed in financial or operational reporting,
among other elements.
Under the IIA standards, a critical component of the audit process is the
preparation of a balanced report that provides executives and the board with
the opportunity to evaluate and weigh the issues being reported in the proper
context and perspective. In providing perspective, analysis and workable
recommendations for business improvements in critical areas, auditors help the
organization meet its objectives.

approach._[_9_] Internal audit functions are primarily evaluated based on the
quality of counsel and information provided to the Audit Committee and top
management. However, this is primarily qualitative and therefore difficult to
measure. "Customer surveys" sent to key managers after each audit engagement or
report can be used to measure performance, with an annual survey to the Audit
Committee. Scoring on dimensions such as professionalism, quality of counsel,
timeliness of work product, utility of meetings, and quality of status updates
are typical with such surveys. Understanding the expectations of senior
management and the audit committee represent important steps in developing a
performance measurement process, as well as how such measures help align the
audit function with organizational priorities._[_1_0_]_[_1_1_]

causing substantial financial or reputational damage to the company. For
particularly complex issues, the responsible manager may participate in the
discussion. Such reporting is critical to ensure the function is respected,

Some of the philosophy and approach of internal auditing is derived from the
work of Lawrence Sawyer. His philosophy and guidance on the role of internal
audit was a forerunner of the current definition of internal auditing. It
emphasized assisting management and the Board in achieving the organization‚Äôs
objectives through well-reasoned audits, evaluations, and analyses of
operational areas. He encouraged the modern internal auditor to act as a
counselor to management rather than as an adversary. Sawyer saw auditors as
active players influencing events in the business rather than criticizing all
degrees of errors and mistakes. He also foresaw a more desirable auditor future
involving a stronger relationship with members of Audit Committee and the Board
and a divorce from direct reporting to the Chief Financial Officer._[_1_2_]
Sawyer often talked about ‚Äúcatching a manager doing something right‚Äù and
providing recognition and positive reinforcement. Writing about positive
observations in audit reports was rarely done until Sawyer started talking
about the idea. He understood and forecast the benefits of providing more
balanced reporting while simultaneously building better relationships. Sawyer
understood the psychology of interpersonal dynamics and the need for all people
to receive acknowledgment and validation for relationships to prosper._[_1_2_]
Sawyer helped make internal auditing more relevant and more interesting through
a sharp focus on operational or performance auditing. He strongly encouraged
looking beyond financial statements and financial-related auditing into areas
such as purchasing, warehousing and distribution, human resources, information
technology, facilities management, customer service, field operations, and
program management. This approach helped catapult the chief audit executive
into the role of a respected and knowledgeable adviser who was thought to be
reasonable, objective, and concerned about helping the organization achieve the
stated goals._[_1_2_]
