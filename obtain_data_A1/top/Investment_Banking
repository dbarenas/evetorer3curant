An iinnvveessttmmeenntt bbaannkk is a financial institution that assists individuals,
corporations, and governments in raising capital by _u_n_d_e_r_w_r_i_t_i_n_g and/or acting
as the client's agent in the issuance of _s_e_c_u_r_i_t_i_e_s. An investment bank may
also assist companies involved in _m_e_r_g_e_r_s_ _a_n_d_ _a_c_q_u_i_s_i_t_i_o_n_s and provide
ancillary services such as _m_a_r_k_e_t_ _m_a_k_i_n_g, trading of _d_e_r_i_v_a_t_i_v_e_s and _e_q_u_i_t_y
_s_e_c_u_r_i_t_i_e_s, and FICC services (_f_i_x_e_d_ _i_n_c_o_m_e instruments, _c_u_r_r_e_n_c_i_e_s, and
_c_o_m_m_o_d_i_t_i_e_s).
Unlike _c_o_m_m_e_r_c_i_a_l_ _b_a_n_k_s and _r_e_t_a_i_l_ _b_a_n_k_s, investment banks do not take
deposits. From 1933 (_G_l_a_s_s_â_€_“_S_t_e_a_g_a_l_l_ _A_c_t) until 1999 (_G_r_a_m_m_â_€_“_L_e_a_c_h_â_€_“_B_l_i_l_e_y
_A_c_t), the _U_n_i_t_e_d_ _S_t_a_t_e_s maintained a separation between investment banking and
_c_o_m_m_e_r_c_i_a_l_ _b_a_n_k_s. Other industrialized countries, including _G_8 countries, have
historically not maintained such a separation. As part of the Dodd-Frank Act
2010, _V_o_l_c_k_e_r_ _R_u_l_e asserts full institutional separation of investment banking
services from commercial banking.
There are two main lines of business in investment banking. Trading securities
for cash or for other securities (i.e. facilitating transactions, market-
making), or the promotion of securities (i.e. underwriting, research, etc.) is
the "_s_e_l_l_ _s_i_d_e", while _b_u_y_ _s_i_d_e is a term used to refer to advising
institutions concerned with buying investment services. Private equity funds,
mutual funds, life insurance companies, unit trusts, and hedge funds are the
most common types of buy side entities.
An investment bank can also be split into private and public functions with an
_i_n_f_o_r_m_a_t_i_o_n_ _b_a_r_r_i_e_r which separates the two to prevent information from
crossing. The private areas of the bank deal with private _i_n_s_i_d_e_r_ _i_n_f_o_r_m_a_t_i_o_n
that may not be publicly disclosed, while the public areas such as stock
analysis deal with public information.
An advisor who provides investment banking services in the United States must
be a licensed _b_r_o_k_e_r_-_d_e_a_l_e_r and subject to _S_e_c_u_r_i_t_i_e_s_ _&_ _E_x_c_h_a_n_g_e_ _C_o_m_m_i_s_s_i_o_n

and sales/trading/research, respectively.
Investment banks offer services to both corporations issuing securities and
investors buying securities. For corporations, investment bankers offer
information on when and how to place their securities on the open market, an
activity very important to an investment bank's reputation. Therefore,
investment bankers play a very important role in issuing new security
offerings._[_2_]

three product segments: (1) investment banking (fees for M&A advisory services
and securities underwriting); (2) asset management (fees for sponsored
investment funds), and (3) trading and principal investments (broker-dealer
activities including proprietary trading ("dealer" transactions) and brokerage
trading ("broker" transactions))._[_3_]
In the United States, commercial banking and investment banking were separated
by the Glassâ€“Steagall Act, which was repealed in 1999. The repeal led to more
"_u_n_i_v_e_r_s_a_l_ _b_a_n_k_s" offering an even greater range of services. Many large
commercial banks have therefore developed investment banking divisions through
acquisitions and hiring. Notable large banks with significant investment banks
include _J_P_M_o_r_g_a_n_ _C_h_a_s_e, _B_a_n_k_ _o_f_ _A_m_e_r_i_c_a, _C_r_e_d_i_t_ _S_u_i_s_s_e, _D_e_u_t_s_c_h_e_ _B_a_n_k,

_C_o_r_p_o_r_a_t_e_ _f_i_n_a_n_c_e is the traditional aspect of investment banks which also
involves helping customers raise _f_u_n_d_s in _c_a_p_i_t_a_l_ _m_a_r_k_e_t_s and giving advice on

security issuance, coordinating with bidders, or negotiating with a merger
target. Another term for the investment banking division is corporate finance,
and its advisory group is often termed _m_e_r_g_e_r_s and _a_c_q_u_i_s_i_t_i_o_n_s. A _p_i_t_c_h_ _b_o_o_k
of financial information is generated to market the bank to a potential M&A
client; if the pitch is successful, the bank arranges the deal for the client.
The investment banking division (IBD) is generally divided into industry
coverage and product coverage groups. Industry coverage groups focus on a
specific industry â€“ such as healthcare, public finance (governments), FIG
(financial institutions group), industrials, TMT (technology, media, and
telecommunication) â€“ and maintains relationships with corporations within the
industry to bring in business for the bank. Product coverage groups focus on
financial products â€“ such as mergers and acquisitions, leveraged finance,
public finance, asset finance and leasing, structured finance, restructuring,
equity, and high-grade debt â€“ and generally work and collaborate with
industry groups on the more intricate and specialized needs of a client. _T_h_e

On behalf of the bank and its clients, a large investment bank's primary
function is _b_u_y_i_n_g_ _a_n_d_ _s_e_l_l_i_n_g products. In _m_a_r_k_e_t_ _m_a_k_i_n_g, traders will buy and
sell financial products with the goal of making money on each trade. Sales is
the term for the investment bank's sales force, whose primary job is to call on
institutional and high-net-worth investors to suggest trading ideas (on a
_c_a_v_e_a_t_ _e_m_p_t_o_r basis) and take orders. Sales desks then communicate their
clients' orders to the appropriate _t_r_a_d_i_n_g_ _d_e_s_k_s, which can price and execute
trades, or structure new products that fit a specific need. Structuring has
been a relatively recent activity as _d_e_r_i_v_a_t_i_v_e_s have come into play, with
highly technical and numerate employees working on creating complex structured
products which typically offer much greater margins and returns than underlying
cash securities. In 2010, investment banks came under pressure as a result of
selling complex derivatives contracts to local municipalities in Europe and the
US._[_5_] Strategists advise external as well as internal clients on the
strategies that can be adopted in various markets. Ranging from derivatives to
specific industries, strategists place companies and industries in a
quantitative framework with full consideration of the macroeconomic scene. This
strategy often affects the way the firm will operate in the market, the
direction it would like to take in terms of its proprietary and flow positions,
the suggestions salespersons give to clients, as well as the way _s_t_r_u_c_t_u_r_e_r_s
create new products. Banks also undertake risk through _p_r_o_p_r_i_e_t_a_r_y_ _t_r_a_d_i_n_g,
performed by a special set of traders who do not interface with clients and
through "principal risk"â€”risk undertaken by a trader after he buys or sells a
product to a client and does not hedge his total exposure. Banks seek to
maximize profitability for a given amount of risk on their balance sheet. The
necessity for numerical ability in sales and trading has created jobs for
physics, mathematics and engineering _P_h_._D_._s who act as _q_u_a_n_t_i_t_a_t_i_v_e_ _a_n_a_l_y_s_t_s.

The _e_q_u_i_t_y_ _r_e_s_e_a_r_c_h division reviews companies and writes reports about their
prospects, often with "buy" or "sell" ratings. Investment banks typically have
_s_e_l_l_-_s_i_d_e_ _a_n_a_l_y_s_t_s which cover various industries. Their sponsored funds or
proprietary trading offices will also have buy-side research. While the
research division may or may not generate revenue (based on policies at
different banks), its resources are used to assist traders in trading, the
sales force in suggesting ideas to customers, and investment bankers by
covering their clients. Research also serves outside clients with investment
advice (such as institutional investors and high net worth individuals) in the
hopes that these clients will execute suggested _t_r_a_d_e_ _i_d_e_a_s through the sales
and trading division of the bank, and thereby generate revenue for the firm.
Research also covers credit research, fixed income research, macroeconomic
research, and quantitative analysis, all of which are used internally and
externally to advise clients but do not directly affect revenue. All research
groups, nonetheless, provide a key service in terms of advisory and strategy.
There is a potential conflict of interest between the investment bank and its
analysis, in that published analysis can affect the bank's profits. Hence in
recent years the relationship between investment banking and research has
become highly regulated, requiring a _C_h_i_n_e_s_e_ _w_a_l_l between public and private
functions.

Risk management involves analyzing the market and credit risk that an
investment bank or its clients take onto their balance sheet during
transactions or trades. Credit risk focuses around capital markets activities,
such as loan syndication, bond issuance, restructuring, and leveraged finance.
Market risk conducts review of sales and trading activities utilizing the VaR
model and provide hedge-fund solutions to portfolio managers. Other risk groups
include country risk, operational risk, and counterparty risks which may or may
not exist on a bank to bank basis. Credit risk solutions are key part of
capital market transactions, involving debt structuring, exit financing, loan
amendment, _p_r_o_j_e_c_t_ _f_i_n_a_n_c_e, leveraged buy-outs, and sometimes portfolio
hedging. Front office market risk activities provide service to investors via
derivative solutions, portfolio management, portfolio consulting, and risk
advisory. Well-known risk groups in JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Barclays
engage in revenue-generating activities involving debt structuring,
restructuring, loan syndication, and securitization for clients such as
corporates, governments, and hedge funds. J.P. Morgan IB Risk works with
investment banking to execute transactions and advise investors, although its
Finance & Operation risk groups focus on middle office functions involving
internal, non-revenue generating, operational risk controls._[_6_]_[_7_]_[_8_] _C_r_e_d_i_t
_d_e_f_a_u_l_t_ _s_w_a_p, for instance, is a famous credit risk hedging solution for
clients invented by J.P. Morgan's _B_l_y_t_h_e_ _M_a_s_t_e_r_s during the 1990s. The Loan
Risk Solutions group_[_9_] within Barclays' investment banking division and Risk
Management and Financing group_[_1_0_] housed in Goldman Sach's securities division
are client-driven franchises. However, risk management groups such as
operational risk, internal risk control, legal risk, and the one at Morgan
Stanley are restrained to internal business functions including firm balance-
sheet risk analysis and assigning trading cap that are independent of client
needs, even though these groups may be responsible for deal approval that
directly affects capital market activities. Risk management is a broad area,
and like research, its roles can be client-facing or internal.

losses. As of late 2012, global revenues for investment banks were estimated at
$240 billion, down about a third from 2009, as companies pursued less deals and
traded less._[_1_6_] Differences in total revenue are likely due to different ways
of classifying investment banking revenue, such as subtracting proprietary
trading revenue.
In terms of total revenue, SEC filings of the major independent investment
banks in the United States show that investment banking (defined as M&A
advisory services and security underwriting) only made up about 15-20% of total
revenue for these banks from 1996 to 2006, with the majority of revenue (60+%
in some years) brought in by "trading" which includes brokerage commissions and
_p_r_o_p_r_i_e_t_a_r_y_ _t_r_a_d_i_n_g; the proprietary trading is estimated to provide a
significant portion of this revenue._[_3_]
The _U_n_i_t_e_d_ _S_t_a_t_e_s generated 46% of global revenue in 2009, down from 56% in
1999. Europe (with Middle East and Africa) generated about a third while Asian
countries generated the remaining 21%._[_1_5_]:8 The industry is heavily
concentrated in a small number of major financial centers, including _C_i_t_y_ _o_f
_L_o_n_d_o_n, _N_e_w_ _Y_o_r_k_ _C_i_t_y, _F_r_a_n_k_f_u_r_t, _H_o_n_g_ _K_o_n_g and _T_o_k_y_o.
According to estimates published by the International Financial Services
London, for the decade prior to the financial crisis in 2008, M&A was a primary
source of investment banking revenue, often accounting for 40% of such revenue,
but dropped during and after the financial crisis._[_1_5_]:9 Equity underwriting
revenue ranged from 30% to 38% and fixed-income underwriting accounted for the
remaining revenue._[_1_5_]:9
Revenues have been affected by the introduction of new products with higher
margins; however, these innovations are often copied quickly by competing
banks, pushing down trading margins. For example, brokerages commissions for
bond and equity trading is a commodity business but structuring and trading
_d_e_r_i_v_a_t_i_v_e_s has higher margins because each _o_v_e_r_-_t_h_e_-_c_o_u_n_t_e_r contract has to be
uniquely structured and could involve complex pay-off and risk profiles. One
growth area is _p_r_i_v_a_t_e_ _i_n_v_e_s_t_m_e_n_t_ _i_n_ _p_u_b_l_i_c_ _e_q_u_i_t_y (PIPEs, otherwise known as
Regulation D or Regulation S). Such transactions are privately negotiated
between companies and _a_c_c_r_e_d_i_t_e_d_ _i_n_v_e_s_t_o_r_s.
Banks also earned revenue by securitizing debt, particularly mortgage debt
prior to the financial crisis. Investment banks have become concerned that
lenders are securitizing in-house, driving the investment banks to pursue
_v_e_r_t_i_c_a_l_ _i_n_t_e_g_r_a_t_i_o_n by becoming lenders, which is allowed in the United States
since the repeal of the Glass-Steagall act in 1999.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]

The 2008 financial credit crisis led to the notable collapse of several banks,
notably including the bankruptcy of large investment bank _L_e_h_m_a_n_ _B_r_o_t_h_e_r_s and
the hurried sale of _M_e_r_r_i_l_l_ _L_y_n_c_h and the much smaller _B_e_a_r_ _S_t_e_a_r_n_s to banks
which effectively rescued them from bankruptcy. The entire financial services
industry, including numerous investment banks, was rescued by government loans
through the _T_r_o_u_b_l_e_d_ _A_s_s_e_t_ _R_e_l_i_e_f_ _P_r_o_g_r_a_m (TARP). Surviving U.S. investment
banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley converted to traditional bank
holding companies to accept TARP relief._[_1_8_] Similar situations occurred across
the globe with countries rescuing their banking industry. Initially, banks
received part of a $700 billion _T_r_o_u_b_l_e_d_ _A_s_s_e_t_ _R_e_l_i_e_f_ _P_r_o_g_r_a_m (TARP) intended
to stabilize the economy and thaw the frozen credit markets._[_1_9_] Eventually,
taxpayer assistance to banks reached nearly $13 trillion, most without much
scrutiny,_[_2_0_] lending did not increase_[_2_1_] and credit markets remained frozen.
_[_2_2_]
The crisis led to questioning of the _b_u_s_i_n_e_s_s_ _m_o_d_e_l of the investment bank_[_2_3_]
without the regulation imposed on it by Glass-Steagall.[_n_e_u_t_r_a_l_i_t_y is _d_i_s_p_u_t_e_d]
Once _R_o_b_e_r_t_ _R_u_b_i_n, a former co-chairman of _G_o_l_d_m_a_n_ _S_a_c_h_s, became part of the
_C_l_i_n_t_o_n administration and deregulated banks, the previous conservatism of
underwriting established companies and seeking long-term gains was replaced by
lower standards and short-term profit._[_2_4_] Formerly, the guidelines said that
in order to take a company public, it had to be in business for a minimum of
five years and it had to show profitability for three consecutive years. After
deregulation, those standards were gone, but small investors did not grasp the
full impact of the change._[_2_4_]
A number of former Goldman-Sachs top executives, such as _H_e_n_r_y_ _P_a_u_l_s_o_n and _E_d
_L_i_d_d_y were in high-level positions in government and oversaw the controversial
taxpayer-funded _b_a_n_k_ _b_a_i_l_o_u_t._[_2_4_] The TARP Oversight Report released by the
_C_o_n_g_r_e_s_s_i_o_n_a_l_ _O_v_e_r_s_i_g_h_t_ _P_a_n_e_l found that the bailout tended to encourage risky
behavior and "corrupt[ed] the fundamental tenets of a _m_a_r_k_e_t_ _e_c_o_n_o_m_y"._[_2_5_]
Under threat of a _s_u_b_p_o_e_n_a, Goldman Sachs revealed that it received $12.9
billion in taxpayer aid, $4.3 billion of which was then paid out to 32
entities, including many overseas banks, _h_e_d_g_e_ _f_u_n_d_s and pensions._[_2_6_] The same
year it received $10 billion in aid from the government, it also paid out
multi-million dollar bonuses; the total paid in bonuses was $4.82 billion._[_2_7_]

The investment banking industry, and many individual investment banks, have
come under criticism for a variety of reasons, including perceived conflicts of
interest, overly large pay packages, cartel-like or oligopolic behavior, taking
both sides in transactions, and more._[_3_0_] Investment banking has also been
criticised for its opacity._[_3_1_]

Conflicts of interest may arise between different parts of a bank, creating the
potential for _m_a_r_k_e_t_ _m_a_n_i_p_u_l_a_t_i_o_n, according to critics. Authorities that
regulate investment banking (the _F_S_A in the _U_n_i_t_e_d_ _K_i_n_g_d_o_m and the _S_E_C in the
_U_n_i_t_e_d_ _S_t_a_t_e_s) require that banks impose a _C_h_i_n_e_s_e_ _w_a_l_l to prevent
communication between investment banking on one side and equity research and
trading on the other. Critics say such a barrier does not always exist in
practice, however.
Conflicts of interest often arise in relation to investment banks' equity
research units, which have long been part of the industry. A common practice is
for equity analysts to initiate coverage of a company in order to develop
relationships that lead to highly profitable investment banking business. In
the 1990s, many equity researchers allegedly traded positive stock ratings for
investment banking business. Alternatively, companies may threaten to divert
investment banking business to competitors unless their stock was rated
favorably. Laws were passed to criminalize such acts, and increased pressure
from regulators and a series of lawsuits, settlements, and prosecutions curbed
this business to a large extent following the 2001 stock market tumble after
the _d_o_t_-_c_o_m_ _b_u_b_b_l_e.
Philip Augar, author of The Greed Merchants, said in an interview that: "You
cannot simultaneously serve the interest of issuer clients and investing
clients. And itâ€™s not just underwriting and sales; investment banks run
proprietary trading operations that are also making a profit out of these
securities."_[_3_0_]
Many investment banks also own retail brokerages. During the 1990s, some retail
brokerages sold consumers securities which did not meet their stated risk
profile. This behavior may have led to investment banking business or even
sales of surplus shares during a public offering to keep public perception of
the stock favorable.
Since investment banks engage heavily in trading for their own account, there
is always the temptation for them to engage in some form of _f_r_o_n_t_ _r_u_n_n_i_n_g â€“
the illegal practice whereby a broker executes orders for their own account
before filling orders previously submitted by their customers, there benefiting
from any changes in prices induced by those orders.

Investment banking is often criticized for the enormous pay packages awarded to
those who work in the industry. According to Bloomberg Wall Street's five
biggest firms paid over $3 billion to their executives from 2003 to 2008,
"while they presided over the packaging and sale of loans that helped bring
down the investment-banking system." _[_3_4_]
The highly generous pay packages include $172 million for Merrill Lynch & Co.
CEO Stanley O'Neal from 2003 to 2007, before it was bought by Bank of America
in 2008, and $161 million for Bear Stearns Co.'s James Cayne before the bank
collapsed and was sold to JPMorgan Chase & Co. in June 2008._[_3_4_]
Such pay arrangements have attracted the ire of Democrats and Republicans in
Congress, who demanded limits on executive pay in 2008 when the U.S. government
was bailing out the industry with a $700 billion financial rescue package._[_3_4_]
Writing in the Global Association of Risk Professionals, Aaron Brown, a vice
president at Morgan Stanley, says "By any standard of human fairness, of
course, investment bankers make obscene amounts of money." _[_3_0_]
