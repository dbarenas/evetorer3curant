_L_a_d_y_ _J_u_s_t_i_c_e is the symbol of _j_u_s_t_i_c_e. Lady Justice is depicted as a _g_o_d_d_e_s_s
equipped with three symbols of justice: a sword symbolising the court's
coercive power; scales representing an objective standard by which competing
claims are weighed; and a blindfold indicating that justice is or should be
meted out objectively, without fear or favor, regardless of power, money,
wealth, or identity._[_1_]
LLaaww is a term which does not have a universally accepted definition,_[_2_] but one
definition is that law is a _s_y_s_t_e_m of rules and guidelines which are enforced
through social institutions to govern behavior._[_3_] Laws can be made by
legislatures through legislation, the executive through decrees and
regulations, or judges through binding precedents (normally in common law
jurisdictions). Private individuals can create legally binding instruments,
though not laws strictly speaking, through for example contractual
arrangements, particularly arbitration agreements that exclude the normal court
process. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a _c_o_n_s_t_i_t_u_t_i_o_n
(written or unwritten) and the _r_i_g_h_t_s encoded therein. The law shapes _p_o_l_i_t_i_c_s,
_e_c_o_n_o_m_i_c_s and _s_o_c_i_e_t_y in various ways and serves as a social mediator of
relations between _p_e_o_p_l_e.
A general distinction can be made between _c_i_v_i_l_ _l_a_w _j_u_r_i_s_d_i_c_t_i_o_n_s (including
_C_a_n_o_n and _S_o_c_i_a_l_i_s_t_ _l_a_w), in which the legislature or other central body
codifies and consolidates their laws, and _c_o_m_m_o_n_ _l_a_w systems, where judge-made
_b_i_n_d_i_n_g _p_r_e_c_e_d_e_n_t_s are accepted. Historically, _r_e_l_i_g_i_o_u_s_ _l_a_w_s played a
significant role even in settling of secular matters, which is still the case
in some countries, particularly Islamic, and some religious communities,
particularly Jewish _H_a_l_a_k_h_a.
The adjudication of the law is generally divided into two main areas. _C_r_i_m_i_n_a_l
_l_a_w deals with conduct that is considered harmful to _s_o_c_i_a_l_ _o_r_d_e_r and in which
the _g_u_i_l_t_y party may be imprisoned or fined. _C_i_v_i_l_ _l_a_w (not to be confused with
civil law jurisdictions above) deals with the resolution of _l_a_w_s_u_i_t_s (disputes)
between individuals or organizations. These resolutions seek to provide a _l_e_g_a_l
_r_e_m_e_d_y (often monetary _d_a_m_a_g_e_s) to the winning _l_i_t_i_g_a_n_t.
Under civil law, the following specialties, among others, exist: _C_o_n_t_r_a_c_t_ _l_a_w
regulates everything from buying a bus ticket to trading on _d_e_r_i_v_a_t_i_v_e_s
_m_a_r_k_e_t_s. _P_r_o_p_e_r_t_y_ _l_a_w regulates the transfer and title of _p_e_r_s_o_n_a_l_ _p_r_o_p_e_r_t_y and
_r_e_a_l_ _p_r_o_p_e_r_t_y. _T_r_u_s_t_ _l_a_w applies to assets held for investment and financial
security. _T_o_r_t_ _l_a_w allows claims for compensation if a person's property is
_h_a_r_m_e_d. _C_o_n_s_t_i_t_u_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _l_a_w provides a framework for the creation of law, the
protection of human rights and the election of political representatives.
_A_d_m_i_n_i_s_t_r_a_t_i_v_e_ _l_a_w is used to review the decisions of government agencies.
_I_n_t_e_r_n_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _l_a_w governs affairs between sovereign states in activities
ranging from trade to military action.
To implement and enforce the law and provide services to the public by public
servants, a government's bureaucracy, the military and police are vital. While
all these organs of the state are creatures created and bound by law, an
independent _l_e_g_a_l_ _p_r_o_f_e_s_s_i_o_n and a vibrant _c_i_v_i_l_ _s_o_c_i_e_t_y inform and support
their progress[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d].
Law provides a rich source of scholarly inquiry into _l_e_g_a_l_ _h_i_s_t_o_r_y, _p_h_i_l_o_s_o_p_h_y,
_e_c_o_n_o_m_i_c_ _a_n_a_l_y_s_i_s and _s_o_c_i_o_l_o_g_y. Law also raises important and complex issues
concerning equality, fairness, and _j_u_s_t_i_c_e. _A_l_l_ _a_r_e_ _e_q_u_a_l_ _b_e_f_o_r_e_ _t_h_e_ _l_a_w_. The
author _A_n_a_t_o_l_e_ _F_r_a_n_c_e said in 1894, "In its majestic equality, the law forbids
_r_i_c_h_ _a_n_d_ _p_o_o_r_ _a_l_i_k_e to sleep under bridges, beg in the streets, and steal
loaves of bread."_[_4_] Writing in 350 BC, the _G_r_e_e_k philosopher _A_r_i_s_t_o_t_l_e
declared, "The _r_u_l_e_ _o_f_ _l_a_w is better than the _r_u_l_e_ _o_f_ _a_n_y_ _i_n_d_i_v_i_d_u_a_l."_[_5_]
_M_i_k_h_a_i_l_ _B_a_k_u_n_i_n said: "All law has for its object to confirm and exalt into a
system the exploitation of the workers by a ruling class"._[_6_] _C_i_c_e_r_o said "more
law, less justice"._[_7_] Marxist doctrine asserts that law will not be required
once the state has _w_i_t_h_e_r_e_d_ _a_w_a_y._[_8_]

There have been many attempts to produce "a universally acceptable definition
of law". By 1972, no such definition had been produced._[_2_] McCoubrey and White
said that the question "what is law?" has no simple answer._[_9_] _G_l_a_n_v_i_l_l_e
_W_i_l_l_i_a_m_s said that the meaning of the word "law" depends on the context in
which that word is used. He said that, for example, "_e_a_r_l_y_ _c_u_s_t_o_m_a_r_y_ _l_a_w" and
"_m_u_n_i_c_i_p_a_l_ _l_a_w" were contexts where the word "law" had two different and
irreconcilable meanings._[_1_0_] _T_h_u_r_m_a_n_ _A_r_n_o_l_d said that it is obvious that it is
impossible to define the word "law" and that it is also equally obvious that
the struggle to define that word should not ever be abandoned._[_1_1_] It is
possible to take the view that there is no need to define the word "law" (e.g.
"let's forget about generalities and get down to _c_a_s_e_s")._[_1_2_]

_L_a_w Hart argued law is a "system of rules";_[_1_3_] Austin said law was "the
command of a sovereign, backed by the threat of a sanction";_[_1_4_] Dworkin
describes law as an "interpretive concept" to achieve _j_u_s_t_i_c_e;_[_1_5_] and Raz
argues law is an "authority" to mediate people's interests._[_1_6_] Holmes said
"The prohecies of what the courts will do in fact, and nothing more
pretentious, are what I mean by the law."_[_1_7_] Aquinas said that law is a
rational ordering of things which concern the common good that is promulgated
by whoever is charged with the care of the community._[_1_8_] This definition has
both positivist and naturalist elements._[_1_9_]

All legal systems deal with the same basic issues, but jurisdictions categorise
and identify its legal subjects in different ways. A common distinction is that
between "_p_u_b_l_i_c_ _l_a_w" (a term related closely to the _s_t_a_t_e, and including
constitutional, administrative and criminal law), and "_p_r_i_v_a_t_e_ _l_a_w" (which
covers contract, _t_o_r_t and property)._[_2_0_] In _c_i_v_i_l_ _l_a_w systems, contract and
tort fall under a general _l_a_w_ _o_f_ _o_b_l_i_g_a_t_i_o_n_s, while trusts law is dealt with

individuals against the state. Most jurisdictions, like the _U_n_i_t_e_d_ _S_t_a_t_e_s and

the _U_n_i_t_e_d_ _K_i_n_g_d_o_m, have no such document. A "constitution" is simply those
laws which constitute the _b_o_d_y_ _p_o_l_i_t_i_c, from _s_t_a_t_u_t_e, _c_a_s_e_ _l_a_w and _c_o_n_v_e_n_t_i_o_n.

deriving from the common law. Mr Entick's house was searched and ransacked by
Sheriff Carrington. When Mr Entick complained in court, Sheriff Carrington
argued that a warrant from a Government minister, the _E_a_r_l_ _o_f_ _H_a_l_i_f_a_x, was
valid authority. However, there was no written statutory provision or court
authority. The leading judge, _L_o_r_d_ _C_a_m_d_e_n, stated that,
     The great end, for which men entered into society, was to secure
     their property. That right is preserved sacred and incommunicable in
     all instances, where it has not been taken away or abridged by some
     public law for the good of the whole ... If no excuse can be found or
     produced, the silence of the books is an authority against the
     defendant, and the plaintiff must have judgment._[_2_9_]
The fundamental constitutional principle, inspired by _J_o_h_n_ _L_o_c_k_e, holds that
_t_h_e_ _i_n_d_i_v_i_d_u_a_l_ _c_a_n_ _d_o_ _a_n_y_t_h_i_n_g_ _b_u_t_ _t_h_a_t_ _w_h_i_c_h_ _i_s_ _f_o_r_b_i_d_d_e_n_ _b_y_ _l_a_w, and the
state may do nothing but that which is authorised by law._[_3_0_]_[_3_1_]

Criminal law, also known as penal law, pertains to crimes and punishment._[_3_3_]
It thus regulates the definition of and penalties for offences found to have a
sufficiently deleterious social impact but, in itself, makes no moral judgment
on an offender nor imposes restrictions on society that physically prevents
people from committing a crime in the first place._[_3_4_] Investigating,
apprehending, charging, and trying suspected offenders is regulated by the law
of _c_r_i_m_i_n_a_l_ _p_r_o_c_e_d_u_r_e._[_3_5_] The paradigm case of a crime lies in the proof,
_b_e_y_o_n_d_ _r_e_a_s_o_n_a_b_l_e_ _d_o_u_b_t, that a person is guilty of two things. First, the
accused must commit an act which is deemed by society to be criminal, or _a_c_t_u_s
_r_e_u_s (guilty act)._[_3_6_] Second, the accused must have the requisite _m_a_l_i_c_i_o_u_s
_i_n_t_e_n_t to do a criminal act, or _m_e_n_s_ _r_e_a (guilty mind). However, for so called
"_s_t_r_i_c_t_ _l_i_a_b_i_l_i_t_y" crimes, an actus reus is enough._[_3_7_] Criminal systems of the
civil law tradition distinguish between intention in the broad sense (dolus
directus and dolus eventualis), and negligence. Negligence does not carry
criminal responsibility unless a particular crime provides for its punishment.

A depiction of a 1600s criminal trial, for _w_i_t_c_h_c_r_a_f_t in _S_a_l_e_m
Examples of crimes include murder, assault, fraud and theft. In exceptional
circumstances defences can apply to specific acts, such as killing in _s_e_l_f
_d_e_f_e_n_c_e, or pleading _i_n_s_a_n_i_t_y. Another example is in the 19th-century English
case of _R_ _v_ _D_u_d_l_e_y_ _a_n_d_ _S_t_e_p_h_e_n_s, which tested a defence of "_n_e_c_e_s_s_i_t_y". The
Mignonette, sailing from _S_o_u_t_h_a_m_p_t_o_n to Sydney, sank. Three crew members and
Richard Parker, a 17-year-old cabin boy, were stranded on a raft. They were
starving and the cabin boy was close to death. Driven to extreme hunger, the
crew killed and ate the cabin boy. The crew survived and were rescued, but put
on trial for murder. They argued it was necessary to kill the cabin boy to
preserve their own lives. _L_o_r_d_ _C_o_l_e_r_i_d_g_e, expressing immense disapproval,
ruled, "to preserve one's life is generally speaking a duty, but it may be the
plainest and the highest duty to sacrifice it." The men were sentenced to _h_a_n_g,
but public opinion was overwhelmingly supportive of the crew's right to
preserve their own lives. In the end, the _C_r_o_w_n commuted their sentences to six
months in jail._[_4_0_]
Criminal law offences are viewed as offences against not just individual
victims, but the community as well._[_3_4_] The state, usually with the help of
police, takes the lead in prosecution, which is why in common law countries
cases are cited as "The People v ..." or "R (for _R_e_x or _R_e_g_i_n_a) v ..." Also,
lay _j_u_r_i_e_s are often used to determine the guilt of defendants on points of
fact: juries cannot change legal rules. Some developed countries still condone
capital punishment for criminal activity, but the normal punishment for a crime
will be _i_m_p_r_i_s_o_n_m_e_n_t, _f_i_n_e_s, state supervision (such as probation), or
_c_o_m_m_u_n_i_t_y_ _s_e_r_v_i_c_e. Modern criminal law has been affected considerably by the
social sciences, especially with respect to _s_e_n_t_e_n_c_i_n_g, legal research,
legislation, and _r_e_h_a_b_i_l_i_t_a_t_i_o_n._[_4_1_] On the international field, 111 countries

Contract law concerns enforceable promises, and can be summed up in the Latin
phrase _p_a_c_t_a_ _s_u_n_t_ _s_e_r_v_a_n_d_a (agreements must be kept)._[_4_3_] In common law
jurisdictions, three key elements to the creation of a contract are necessary:
_o_f_f_e_r_ _a_n_d_ _a_c_c_e_p_t_a_n_c_e, _c_o_n_s_i_d_e_r_a_t_i_o_n and the intention to create legal
relations. In _C_a_r_l_i_l_l_ _v_ _C_a_r_b_o_l_i_c_ _S_m_o_k_e_ _B_a_l_l_ _C_o_m_p_a_n_y a medical firm advertised
that its new wonder drug, the smokeball, would cure people's flu, and if it did
not, the buyers would get _Â_£100. Many people sued for their Â£100 when the drug
did not work. Fearing bankruptcy, Carbolic argued the advert was not to be
taken as a serious, legally binding offer. It was an _i_n_v_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _t_o_ _t_r_e_a_t, mere
puff, a gimmick. But the court of appeal held that to a _r_e_a_s_o_n_a_b_l_e_ _m_a_n Carbolic
had made a serious offer. People had given good consideration for it by going
to the "distinct inconvenience" of using a faulty product. "Read the
advertisement how you will, and twist it about as you will", said _L_o_r_d_ _J_u_s_t_i_c_e
_L_i_n_d_l_e_y, "here is a distinct promise expressed in language which is perfectly
unmistakable"._[_4_4_]
"Consideration" indicates the fact that all parties to a contract have
exchanged something of value. Some common law systems, including Australia, are
moving away from the idea of consideration as a requirement. The idea of
_e_s_t_o_p_p_e_l or culpa in contrahendo, can be used to create obligations during pre-
contractual negotiations._[_4_5_] In civil law jurisdictions, consideration is not
required for a contract to be binding._[_4_6_] In France, an ordinary contract is
said to form simply on the basis of a "meeting of the minds" or a "concurrence
of wills". _G_e_r_m_a_n_y has a special approach to contracts, which ties into
property law. Their '_a_b_s_t_r_a_c_t_i_o_n_ _p_r_i_n_c_i_p_l_e' (Abstraktionsprinzip) means that
the personal obligation of contract forms separately from the title of property
being conferred. When contracts are invalidated for some reason (e.g. a car
buyer is so drunk that he lacks legal capacity to contract)_[_4_7_] the contractual
obligation to pay can be invalidated separately from the proprietary title of
the car. _U_n_j_u_s_t_ _e_n_r_i_c_h_m_e_n_t law, rather than contract law, is then used to
restore title to the rightful owner._[_4_8_]

The "_M_c_L_i_b_e_l" two were involved in the longest-running case in UK history for
publishing a pamphlet criticising _M_c_D_o_n_a_l_d_'_s restaurants.
Torts, sometimes called _d_e_l_i_c_t_s, are civil wrongs. To have acted tortiously,
one must have breached a duty to another person, or infringed some pre-existing
legal right. A simple example might be accidentally hitting someone with a
cricket ball._[_4_9_] Under the law of _n_e_g_l_i_g_e_n_c_e, the most common form of tort,
the injured party could potentially claim compensation for his injuries from
the party responsible. The principles of negligence are illustrated by _D_o_n_o_g_h_u_e
_v_ _S_t_e_v_e_n_s_o_n._[_5_0_] A friend of Mrs Donoghue ordered an opaque bottle of _g_i_n_g_e_r
_b_e_e_r (intended for the consumption of Mrs Donoghue) in a cafÃ© in _P_a_i_s_l_e_y.
Having consumed half of it, Mrs Donoghue poured the remainder into a tumbler.
The decomposing remains of a snail floated out. She claimed to have suffered
from shock, fell ill with gastroenteritis and sued the manufacturer for
carelessly allowing the drink to be contaminated. The _H_o_u_s_e_ _o_f_ _L_o_r_d_s decided
that the manufacturer was liable for Mrs Donoghue's illness. _L_o_r_d_ _A_t_k_i_n took a
distinctly moral approach, and said,
     The liability for negligence ... is no doubt based upon a general
     public sentiment of moral wrongdoing for which the offender must pay
     ... The rule that you are to love your neighbour becomes in law, you
     must not injure your neighbour; and the _l_a_w_y_e_r's question, Who is my
     neighbour? receives a restricted reply. You must take reasonable care
     to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be
     likely to injure your neighbour._[_5_1_]
This became the basis for the four principles of negligence; (1) Mr Stevenson
owed Mrs Donoghue a _d_u_t_y_ _o_f_ _c_a_r_e to provide safe drinks (2) he _b_r_e_a_c_h_e_d his
duty of care (3) the harm would not have occurred _b_u_t_ _f_o_r his breach and (4)
his act was the _p_r_o_x_i_m_a_t_e_ _c_a_u_s_e, or not too _r_e_m_o_t_e a consequence, of her harm.
_[_5_0_] Another example of tort might be a neighbour making excessively loud
noises with machinery on his property._[_5_2_] Under a _n_u_i_s_a_n_c_e claim the noise
could be stopped. Torts can also involve intentional acts, such as _a_s_s_a_u_l_t,
_b_a_t_t_e_r_y or _t_r_e_s_p_a_s_s. A better known tort is _d_e_f_a_m_a_t_i_o_n, which occurs, for
example, when a newspaper makes unsupportable allegations that damage a
politician's reputation._[_5_3_] More infamous are economic torts, which form the
basis of _l_a_b_o_u_r_ _l_a_w in some countries by making trade unions liable for
strikes,_[_5_4_] when statute does not provide immunity._[_5_5_]

back. Land law forms the basis for most kinds of property law, and is the most
complex. It concerns _m_o_r_t_g_a_g_e_s, _r_e_n_t_a_l_ _a_g_r_e_e_m_e_n_t_s, _l_i_c_e_n_c_e_s, _c_o_v_e_n_a_n_t_s,

_D_e_l_a_m_i_r_i_e [1722]._[_5_8_] A _c_h_i_m_n_e_y_ _s_w_e_e_p's boy found a jewel encrusted with
precious stones. He took it to a goldsmith to have it valued. The goldsmith's
apprentice looked at it, sneakily removed the stones, told the boy it was worth
three _h_a_l_f_p_e_n_c_e and that he would buy it. The boy said he would prefer the
jewel back, so the apprentice gave it to him, but without the stones. The boy
sued the goldsmith for his apprentice's attempt to cheat him. _L_o_r_d_ _C_h_i_e_f
_J_u_s_t_i_c_e_ _P_r_a_t_t ruled that even though the boy could not be said to own the
jewel, he should be considered the rightful keeper ("finders keeper") until the
original owner is found. In fact the apprentice and the boy both had a right of
_p_o_s_s_e_s_s_i_o_n in the jewel (a technical concept, meaning evidence that something
could belong to someone), but the boy's possessory interest was considered
better, because it could be shown to be first in time. Possession may be nine
tenths of the law, but not all.
This case is used to support the view of property in common law jurisdictions,
that the person who can show the best claim to a piece of property, against any
contesting party, is the owner._[_5_9_] By contrast, the classic civil law approach
to property, propounded by _F_r_i_e_d_r_i_c_h_ _C_a_r_l_ _v_o_n_ _S_a_v_i_g_n_y, is that it is a right
good against the world. Obligations, like contracts and torts, are
conceptualised as rights good between individuals._[_6_0_] The idea of property
raises many further philosophical and political issues. Locke argued that our
"lives, liberties and estates" are our property because we own our bodies and
_m_i_x_ _o_u_r_ _l_a_b_o_u_r with our surroundings._[_6_1_]

The _C_o_u_r_t_ _o_f_ _C_h_a_n_c_e_r_y, London, early 19th century
Equity is a body of rules that developed in England separately from the "common
law". The common law was administered by judges. The _L_o_r_d_ _C_h_a_n_c_e_l_l_o_r on the
other hand, as the King's keeper of conscience, could overrule the judge-made
law if he thought it equitable to do so._[_6_2_] This meant equity came to operate
more through _p_r_i_n_c_i_p_l_e_s than rigid rules. For instance, whereas neither the
common law nor civil law systems allow people to split the ownership from the
control of one piece of property, equity allows this through an arrangement
known as a 'trust'. 'Trustees' control property, whereas the 'beneficial' (or
'equitable') ownership of trust property is held by people known as
'beneficiaries'. Trustees owe duties to their beneficiaries to take good care
of the entrusted property._[_6_3_] In the early case of _K_e_e_c_h_ _v_ _S_a_n_d_f_o_r_d [1722]_[_6_4_]
a child had inherited the _l_e_a_s_e on a _m_a_r_k_e_t in _R_o_m_f_o_r_d, London. Mr Sandford was
entrusted to look after this property until the child matured. But before then,
the lease expired. The landlord had (apparently) told Mr Sandford that he did
not want the child to have the renewed lease. Yet the landlord was happy
(apparently) to give Mr Sandford the opportunity of the lease instead. Mr
Sandford took it. When the child (now Mr Keech) grew up, he sued Mr Sandford
for the profit that he had been making by getting the market's lease. Mr
Sandford was meant to be trusted, but he put himself in a position of _c_o_n_f_l_i_c_t
_o_f_ _i_n_t_e_r_e_s_t. The _L_o_r_d_ _C_h_a_n_c_e_l_l_o_r, _L_o_r_d_ _K_i_n_g, agreed and ordered Mr Sandford
should disgorge his profits. He wrote,
     I very well see, if a trustee, on the refusal to renew, might have a
     lease to himself few trust-estates would be renewed ... This may seem
     very hard, that the trustee is the only person of all mankind who
     might not have the lease; but it is very proper that the rule should
     be strictly pursued and not at all relaxed.
Of course, Lord King LC was worried that trustees might exploit opportunities
to use trust property for themselves instead of looking after it. Business
speculators using trusts had just recently caused a _s_t_o_c_k_ _m_a_r_k_e_t_ _c_r_a_s_h. Strict
duties for trustees made their way into company law and were applied to
directors and chief executive officers. Another example of a trustee's duty
might be to invest property wisely or sell it._[_6_5_] This is especially the case
for pension funds, the most important form of trust, where investors are
trustees for people's savings until retirement. But trusts can also be set up
for _c_h_a_r_i_t_a_b_l_e_ _p_u_r_p_o_s_e_s, famous examples being the _B_r_i_t_i_s_h_ _M_u_s_e_u_m or the

In general, legal systems can be split between civil law and common law
systems._[_6_9_] The term "civil law" referring to a legal system should not be
confused with "civil law" as a group of legal subjects distinct from criminal
or _p_u_b_l_i_c_ _l_a_w. A third type of legal systemâaccepted by some countries
without _s_e_p_a_r_a_t_i_o_n_ _o_f_ _c_h_u_r_c_h_ _a_n_d_ _s_t_a_t_eâis religious law, based on _s_c_r_i_p_t_u_r_e_s.
The specific system that a country is ruled by is often determined by its
history, connections with other countries, or its adherence to international
standards. The _s_o_u_r_c_e_s that jurisdictions adopt as authoritatively binding are
the defining features of any legal system. Yet classification is a matter of
form rather than substance, since similar rules often prevail.

Civil law is the legal system used in most countries around the world today. In
civil law the sources recognised as authoritative are, primarily,
legislationâespecially _c_o_d_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n_s in constitutions or _s_t_a_t_u_t_e_s passed by
governmentâand _c_u_s_t_o_m._[_7_0_] Codifications date back millennia, with one early
example being the _B_a_b_y_l_o_n_i_a_n _C_o_d_e_x_ _H_a_m_m_u_r_a_b_i. Modern civil law systems
essentially derive from the legal practice of the 6th-century _E_a_s_t_e_r_n_ _R_o_m_a_n
_E_m_p_i_r_e whose texts were rediscovered by late _m_e_d_i_e_v_a_l Western Europe. Roman law
in the days of the _R_o_m_a_n_ _R_e_p_u_b_l_i_c and Empire was heavily procedural, and lacked
a professional legal class._[_7_1_] Instead a lay _m_a_g_i_s_t_r_a_t_e, iudex, was chosen to
adjudicate. Precedents were not reported, so any case law that developed was
disguised and almost unrecognised._[_7_2_] Each case was to be decided afresh from
the laws of the State, which mirrors the (theoretical) unimportance of judges'
decisions for future cases in civil law systems today. From 529â534 AD the
_B_y_z_a_n_t_i_n_e Emperor _J_u_s_t_i_n_i_a_n_ _I codified and consolidated Roman law up until that
point, so that what remained was one-twentieth of the mass of legal texts from
before._[_7_3_] This became known as the _C_o_r_p_u_s_ _J_u_r_i_s_ _C_i_v_i_l_i_s. As one legal
historian wrote, "Justinian consciously looked back to the golden age of Roman
law and aimed to restore it to the peak it had reached three centuries before."
_[_7_4_] The Justinian Code remained in force in the East until the fall of the
_B_y_z_a_n_t_i_n_e_ _E_m_p_i_r_e. Western Europe, meanwhile, relied on a mix of the _T_h_e_o_d_o_s_i_a_n
_C_o_d_e and Germanic customary law until the Justinian Code was rediscovered in
the 11th century, and scholars at the _U_n_i_v_e_r_s_i_t_y_ _o_f_ _B_o_l_o_g_n_a used it to
interpret their own laws._[_7_5_] Civil law codifications based closely on Roman
law, alongside some influences from _r_e_l_i_g_i_o_u_s_ _l_a_w_s such as _C_a_n_o_n_ _l_a_w, continued
to spread throughout Europe until the _E_n_l_i_g_h_t_e_n_m_e_n_t; then, in the 19th century,
both France, with the _C_o_d_e_ _C_i_v_i_l, and Germany, with the _B_Ã_¼_r_g_e_r_l_i_c_h_e_s
_G_e_s_e_t_z_b_u_c_h, modernised their legal codes. Both these codes influenced heavily
not only the law systems of the countries in continental Europe (e.g. Greece),
but also the _J_a_p_a_n_e_s_e and _K_o_r_e_a_n legal traditions._[_7_6_]_[_7_7_] Today, countries
that have civil law systems range from _R_u_s_s_i_a and _C_h_i_n_a to most of _C_e_n_t_r_a_l and

King John of England signs Magna Carta
Common law and equity are legal systems where decisions by courts are
explicitly acknowledged as legal sources. The "doctrine of precedent", or _s_t_a_r_e
_d_e_c_i_s_i_s (Latin for "to stand by decisions") means that decisions by higher
courts bind lower courts. Common law systems also rely on statutes, passed by
the legislature, but may make less of a systematic attempt to codify their laws
than in a "civil law" system. Common law originated from England and has been
inherited by almost every country once tied to the _B_r_i_t_i_s_h_ _E_m_p_i_r_e (except
Malta, _S_c_o_t_l_a_n_d, the U.S. state of _L_o_u_i_s_i_a_n_a, and the Canadian province of
_Q_u_e_b_e_c). In medieval England, the _N_o_r_m_a_n_ _c_o_n_q_u_e_s_t led to a unification of
various tribal customs and hence a law "common" to the whole country. The
common law developed when the English monarchy had been weakened by the
enormous cost of fighting for control over large parts of France. _K_i_n_g_ _J_o_h_n had
been forced by his barons to sign a document limiting his authority to pass
laws. This "great charter" or _M_a_g_n_a_ _C_a_r_t_a of 1215 also required that the King's
entourage of judges hold their courts and judgments at "a certain place" rather
than dispensing autocratic justice in unpredictable places about the country.
_[_7_9_] A concentrated and elite group of judges acquired a dominant role in law-
making under this system, and compared to its European counterparts the English
judiciary became highly centralised. In 1297, for instance, while the highest
court in France had fifty-one judges, the _E_n_g_l_i_s_h_ _C_o_u_r_t_ _o_f_ _C_o_m_m_o_n_ _P_l_e_a_s had
five._[_8_0_] This powerful and tight-knit judiciary gave rise to a rigid and
inflexible system of common law._[_8_1_] As a result, as time went on, increasing
numbers of citizens petitioned the King to override the common law, and on the
King's behalf the _L_o_r_d_ _C_h_a_n_c_e_l_l_o_r gave judgment to do what was equitable in a
case. From the time of _S_i_r_ _T_h_o_m_a_s_ _M_o_r_e, the first _l_a_w_y_e_r to be appointed as
Lord Chancellor, a systematic body of equity grew up alongside the rigid common
law, and developed its own _C_o_u_r_t_ _o_f_ _C_h_a_n_c_e_r_y. At first, equity was often
criticised as erratic, that it varied according to the length of the
Chancellor's foot._[_8_2_] But over time it developed solid _p_r_i_n_c_i_p_l_e_s, especially
under _L_o_r_d_ _E_l_d_o_n._[_8_3_] In the 19th century the two systems were fused into one
another. In developing the common law and equity, academic authors have always
played an important part. _W_i_l_l_i_a_m_ _B_l_a_c_k_s_t_o_n_e, from around 1760, was the first
scholar to describe and teach it._[_8_4_] But merely in describing, scholars who
sought explanations and underlying structures slowly changed the way the law
actually worked._[_8_5_]

Religious law is explicitly based on religious precepts. Examples include the
Jewish _H_a_l_a_k_h_a and Islamic _S_h_a_r_i_aâboth of which translate as the "path to
follow"âwhile Christian _c_a_n_o_n_ _l_a_w also survives in some church communities.
Often the implication of religion for law is unalterability, because the word
of God cannot be amended or legislated against by judges or governments.
[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] However a thorough and detailed legal system generally
requires human elaboration. For instance, the _Q_u_r_a_n has some law, and it acts
as a source of further law through interpretation,_[_8_6_] _Q_i_y_a_s (reasoning by
analogy), _I_j_m_a (consensus) and _p_r_e_c_e_d_e_n_t. This is mainly contained in a body of
law and jurisprudence known as _S_h_a_r_i_a and _F_i_q_h respectively. Another example is
the _T_o_r_a_h or _O_l_d_ _T_e_s_t_a_m_e_n_t, in the _P_e_n_t_a_t_e_u_c_h or Five Books of Moses. This
contains the basic code of Jewish law, which some Israeli communities choose to
use. The _H_a_l_a_k_h_a is a code of Jewish law which summarises some of the Talmud's
interpretations. Nevertheless, _I_s_r_a_e_l_i_ _l_a_w allows _l_i_t_i_g_a_n_t_s to use religious
laws only if they choose. Canon law is only in use by members of the Catholic
Church, the _E_a_s_t_e_r_n_ _O_r_t_h_o_d_o_x_ _C_h_u_r_c_h and the _A_n_g_l_i_c_a_n_ _C_o_m_m_u_n_i_o_n.

being a first attempt at _c_o_d_i_f_y_i_n_g elements of Sharia law. Since the mid-1940s,
efforts have been made, in country after country, to bring Sharia law more into
line with modern conditions and conceptions._[_8_7_]_[_8_8_] In modern times, the legal
systems of many Muslim countries draw upon both civil and common law traditions
as well as Islamic law and custom. The constitutions of certain Muslim states,
such as Egypt and Afghanistan, recognise Islam as the religion of the state,
obliging legislature to adhere to Sharia._[_8_9_] Saudi Arabia recognises Quran as
its constitution, and is governed on the basis of Islamic law._[_9_0_] Iran has
also witnessed a reiteration of Islamic law into its legal system after 1979.

The history of law connects closely to the development of _c_i_v_i_l_i_z_a_t_i_o_n. _A_n_c_i_e_n_t
_E_g_y_p_t_i_a_n law, dating as far back as 3000 BC, contained a civil code that was
probably broken into twelve books. It was based on the concept of _M_a_'_a_t,
characterised by tradition, _r_h_e_t_o_r_i_c_a_l speech, social equality and
impartiality._[_9_3_]_[_9_4_] By the 22nd century BC, the ancient _S_u_m_e_r_i_a_n ruler _U_r_-
_N_a_m_m_u had formulated the first _l_a_w_ _c_o_d_e, which consisted of _c_a_s_u_i_s_t_i_c
statements ("if ... then ..."). Around 1760 BC, _K_i_n_g_ _H_a_m_m_u_r_a_b_i further
developed _B_a_b_y_l_o_n_i_a_n_ _l_a_w, by codifying and inscribing it in stone. Hammurabi
placed several copies of his law code throughout the kingdom of Babylon as
_s_t_e_l_a_e, for the entire public to see; this became known as the _C_o_d_e_x_ _H_a_m_m_u_r_a_b_i.
The most intact copy of these stelae was discovered in the 19th century by
British Assyriologists, and has since been fully _t_r_a_n_s_l_i_t_e_r_a_t_e_d and translated
into various languages, including English, German, and French._[_9_5_]
The _O_l_d_ _T_e_s_t_a_m_e_n_t dates back to 1280 BC and takes the form of moral imperatives
as recommendations for a good society. The small _G_r_e_e_k city-state, ancient
_A_t_h_e_n_s, from about the 8th century BC was the first society to be based on
broad inclusion of its citizenry, excluding women and the _s_l_a_v_e class. However,
Athens had no legal science or single word for "law",_[_9_6_] relying instead on
the three-way distinction between divine law (thÃ©mis), human decree (nomos)
and custom (dÃ­kÄ)._[_9_7_] Yet _A_n_c_i_e_n_t_ _G_r_e_e_k_ _l_a_w contained major _c_o_n_s_t_i_t_u_t_i_o_n_a_l

Over the centuries between the rise and decline of the _R_o_m_a_n_ _E_m_p_i_r_e, law was
adapted to cope with the changing social situations and underwent major
codification under _T_h_e_o_d_o_s_i_u_s_ _I_I and _J_u_s_t_i_n_i_a_n_ _I._[_1_0_1_] Although codes were

rediscovered around the 11th century when medieval legal scholars began to
research Roman codes and adapt their concepts. Latin _l_e_g_a_l_ _m_a_x_i_m_s (called
_b_r_o_c_a_r_d_s) were compiled for guidance. In medieval England, royal courts
developed a body of _p_r_e_c_e_d_e_n_t which later became the _c_o_m_m_o_n_ _l_a_w. A Europe-wide
_L_a_w_ _M_e_r_c_h_a_n_t was formed so that merchants could trade with common standards of
practice rather than with the many splintered facets of local laws. The Law
Merchant, a precursor to modern commercial law, emphasised the freedom to
contract and alienability of property._[_1_0_2_] As nationalism grew in the 18th and
19th centuries, the Law Merchant was incorporated into countries' local law
under new civil codes. The _N_a_p_o_l_e_o_n_i_c and _G_e_r_m_a_n Codes became the most
influential. In contrast to English common law, which consists of enormous
tomes of case law, codes in small books are easy to export and easy for judges
to apply. However, today there are signs that civil and common law are
converging._[_1_0_3_] EU law is codified in treaties, but develops through the

_S_i_n_g_a_p_o_r_e and _H_o_n_g_ _K_o_n_g also adopted the common law. The eastern Asia legal

Japan was the first country to begin modernising its legal system along western
lines, by importing bits of the _F_r_e_n_c_h, but mostly the German Civil Code._[_1_0_8_]
This partly reflected Germany's status as a rising power in the late
19th century. Similarly, _t_r_a_d_i_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _C_h_i_n_e_s_e_ _l_a_w gave way to westernisation
towards the final years of the _C_h_'_i_n_g_ _d_y_n_a_s_t_y in the form of six private law
codes based mainly on the Japanese model of German law._[_1_0_9_] Today _T_a_i_w_a_n_e_s_e
_l_a_w retains the closest affinity to the codifications from that period, because
of the split between _C_h_i_a_n_g_ _K_a_i_-_s_h_e_k's nationalists, who fled there, and _M_a_o
_Z_e_d_o_n_g's communists who won control of the mainland in 1949. The current legal

is undergoing a process of reform, at least in terms of economic, if not social
and political, rights. A new contract code in 1999 represented a move away from

"But what, after all, is a law? [...] When I say that the object of laws is
always general, I mean that law considers subjects en masse and actions in the
abstract, and never a particular person or action. [...] On this view, we at
once see that it can no longer be asked whose business it is to make laws,
since they are acts of the general will; nor whether the prince is above the
law, since he is a member of the State; nor whether the law can be unjust,
since no one is unjust to himself; nor how we can be both free and subject to
the laws, since they are but registers of our wills."
Jean-Jacques Rousseau, _T_h_e_ _S_o_c_i_a_l_ _C_o_n_t_r_a_c_t, II, 6._[_1_1_3_]
The philosophy of law is commonly known as jurisprudence. Normative
jurisprudence is essentially _p_o_l_i_t_i_c_a_l_ _p_h_i_l_o_s_o_p_h_y, and asks "what should law
be?", while analytic jurisprudence asks "what is law?" _J_o_h_n_ _A_u_s_t_i_n's
_u_t_i_l_i_t_a_r_i_a_n answer was that law is "commands, backed by threat of sanctions,
from a sovereign, to whom people have a habit of obedience"._[_1_4_] _N_a_t_u_r_a_l
_l_a_w_y_e_r_s on the other side, such as _J_e_a_n_-_J_a_c_q_u_e_s_ _R_o_u_s_s_e_a_u, argue that law
reflects essentially moral and unchangeable laws of nature. The concept of
"natural law" emerged in ancient _G_r_e_e_k_ _p_h_i_l_o_s_o_p_h_y concurrently and in
entanglement with the notion of justice, and re-entered the mainstream of
_W_e_s_t_e_r_n_ _c_u_l_t_u_r_e through the writings of _T_h_o_m_a_s_ _A_q_u_i_n_a_s.
_H_u_g_o_ _G_r_o_t_i_u_s, the founder of a purely rationalistic system of natural law,
argued that law arises from both a social impulseâas Aristotle had
indicatedâand reason._[_1_1_4_] _I_m_m_a_n_u_e_l_ _K_a_n_t believed a moral imperative requires
laws "be chosen as though they should hold as universal laws of nature"._[_1_1_5_]
_J_e_r_e_m_y_ _B_e_n_t_h_a_m and his student Austin, following _D_a_v_i_d_ _H_u_m_e, believed that this
conflated the _"_i_s_"_ _a_n_d_ _w_h_a_t_ _"_o_u_g_h_t_ _t_o_ _b_e_" problem. Bentham and Austin argued
for law's _p_o_s_i_t_i_v_i_s_m; that real law is entirely separate from "morality"._[_1_1_6_]
Kant was also criticised by _F_r_i_e_d_r_i_c_h_ _N_i_e_t_z_s_c_h_e, who rejected the principle of
equality, and believed that law emanates from the _w_i_l_l_ _t_o_ _p_o_w_e_r, and cannot be
labelled as "moral" or "immoral"._[_1_1_7_]_[_1_1_8_]_[_1_1_9_]
In 1934, the Austrian philosopher _H_a_n_s_ _K_e_l_s_e_n continued the positivist
tradition in his book the _P_u_r_e_ _T_h_e_o_r_y_ _o_f_ _L_a_w._[_1_2_0_] Kelsen believed that
although law is separate from morality, it is endowed with "normativity";
meaning we ought to obey it. While laws are positive "is" statements (e.g. the
fine for reversing on a highway is â¬500); law tells us what we "should" do.
Thus, each legal system can be hypothesised to have a basic norm (_G_r_u_n_d_n_o_r_m)
instructing us to obey. Kelsen's major opponent, _C_a_r_l_ _S_c_h_m_i_t_t, rejected both
positivism and the idea of the _r_u_l_e_ _o_f_ _l_a_w because he did not accept the
primacy of abstract normative principles over concrete political positions and
decisions._[_1_2_1_] Therefore, Schmitt advocated a jurisprudence of the exception
(_s_t_a_t_e_ _o_f_ _e_m_e_r_g_e_n_c_y), which denied that legal norms could encompass of all
political experience._[_1_2_2_]
Bentham's utilitarian theories remained dominant in law until the 20th century
Later in the 20th century, _H_._ _L_._ _A_._ _H_a_r_t attacked Austin for his
simplifications and Kelsen for his fictions in _T_h_e_ _C_o_n_c_e_p_t_ _o_f_ _L_a_w._[_1_2_3_] Hart
argued law is a system of rules, divided into primary (rules of conduct) and
secondary ones (rules addressed to officials to administer primary rules).
Secondary rules are further divided into rules of adjudication (to resolve
legal disputes), rules of change (allowing laws to be varied) and the rule of
recognition (allowing laws to be identified as valid). Two of Hart's students
continued the debate: In his book Law's Empire, _R_o_n_a_l_d_ _D_w_o_r_k_i_n attacked Hart
and the positivists for their refusal to treat law as a moral issue. Dworkin
argues that law is an "_i_n_t_e_r_p_r_e_t_i_v_e concept",_[_1_5_] that requires judges to find
the best fitting and most just solution to a legal dispute, given their
constitutional traditions. _J_o_s_e_p_h_ _R_a_z, on the other hand, defended the
positivist outlook and criticised Hart's "soft social thesis" approach in The
Authority of Law._[_1_6_] Raz argues that law is authority, identifiable purely
through social sources and without reference to moral reasoning. In his view,
any categorisation of rules beyond their role as authoritative instruments in
mediation are best left to _s_o_c_i_o_l_o_g_y, rather than jurisprudence._[_1_2_4_]

same allocation of resources, regardless of the way a court might rule in
property disputes._[_1_2_9_] Coase used the example of a _n_u_i_s_a_n_c_e case named _S_t_u_r_g_e_s

went to court to see who should have to move._[_5_2_] Coase said that regardless of
whether the judge ruled that the sweetmaker had to stop using his machinery, or
that the doctor had to put up with it, they could strike a mutually beneficial
bargain about who moves house that reaches the same outcome of resource
distribution. Only the existence of _t_r_a_n_s_a_c_t_i_o_n_ _c_o_s_t_s may prevent this._[_1_3_0_] So
the law ought to pre-empt what would happen, and be guided by the most

effective at helping people as lawyers and government planners believe._[_1_3_1_]

Sociology of law is a diverse field of study that examines the interaction of
law with society and overlaps with jurisprudence, philosophy of law, social
theory and more specialised subjects such as _c_r_i_m_i_n_o_l_o_g_y._[_1_3_3_] The institutions
of _s_o_c_i_a_l_ _c_o_n_s_t_r_u_c_t_i_o_n, _s_o_c_i_a_l_ _n_o_r_m_s, _d_i_s_p_u_t_e_ _p_r_o_c_e_s_s_i_n_g and _l_e_g_a_l_ _c_u_l_t_u_r_e are
key areas for inquiry in this knowledge field. Sociology of law is sometimes
seen as a sub-discipline of sociology, but its ties to the academic discipline
of law are equally strong, and it is best seen as a transdisciplinary and
multidisciplinary study focused on the theorisation and empirical study of
legal practices and experiences as social phenomena. In the United States the
field is usually called _l_a_w_ _a_n_d_ _s_o_c_i_e_t_y studies; in Europe it is more often
referred to as _s_o_c_i_o_-_l_e_g_a_l_ _s_t_u_d_i_e_s. At first, jurists and legal philosophers
were suspicious of sociology of law. Kelsen attacked one of its founders, _E_u_g_e_n
_E_h_r_l_i_c_h, who sought to make clear the differences and connections between
positive law, which lawyers learn and apply, and other forms of 'law' or social
norms that regulate everyday life, generally preventing conflicts from reaching
lawyers and courts._[_1_3_4_] Contemporary research in sociology of law is much
concerned with the way that law is developing outside discrete state
jurisdictions, being produced through social interaction in many different
kinds of social arenas, and acquiring a diversity of sources of (often
competing or conflicting) authority in communal networks existing sometimes
within nation states but increasingly also transnationally._[_1_3_5_]
_M_a_x_ _W_e_b_e_r in 1917, Weber began his career as a lawyer, and is regarded as one
of the founders of sociology and sociology of law
Around 1900 _M_a_x_ _W_e_b_e_r defined his "scientific" approach to law, identifying the
"legal rational form" as a type of domination, not attributable to personal
authority but to the authority of abstract norms._[_1_3_6_] Formal legal rationality
was his term for the key characteristic of the kind of coherent and calculable
law that was a precondition for modern political developments and the modern
bureaucratic state. Weber saw this law as having developed in parallel with the
growth of capitalism._[_1_3_3_] Another leading sociologist, _Ã__m_i_l_e_ _D_u_r_k_h_e_i_m, wrote
in his classic work The Division of Labour in Society that as society becomes
more complex, the body of civil law concerned primarily with restitution and
compensation grows at the expense of criminal laws and penal sanctions._[_1_3_7_]

European countries the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg can overrule

A judiciary is theoretically bound by the constitution, just as all other
government bodies are. In most countries judges may only _i_n_t_e_r_p_r_e_t the
constitution and all other laws. But in common law countries, where matters are
not constitutional, the judiciary may also create law under the _d_o_c_t_r_i_n_e_ _o_f
_p_r_e_c_e_d_e_n_t. The UK, Finland and New Zealand assert the ideal of _p_a_r_l_i_a_m_e_n_t_a_r_y
_s_o_v_e_r_e_i_g_n_t_y, whereby the unelected judiciary may not overturn law passed by a
democratic legislature._[_1_4_8_]
In _c_o_m_m_u_n_i_s_t_ _s_t_a_t_e_s, such as China, the courts are often regarded as parts of
the executive, or subservient to the legislature; governmental institutions and
actors exert thus various forms of influence on the judiciary._[_1_4_9_] In Muslim
countries, courts often examine whether state laws adhere to the Sharia: the

Prominent examples of legislatures are the _H_o_u_s_e_s_ _o_f_ _P_a_r_l_i_a_m_e_n_t in London, the

principle of representative government people vote for politicians to carry out
their wishes. Although countries like Israel, Greece, Sweden and China are
_u_n_i_c_a_m_e_r_a_l, most countries are _b_i_c_a_m_e_r_a_l, meaning they have two separately
appointed legislative houses._[_1_5_2_]
In the 'lower house' politicians are elected to represent smaller
_c_o_n_s_t_i_t_u_e_n_c_i_e_s. The 'upper house' is usually elected to represent states in a
_f_e_d_e_r_a_l system (as in Australia, Germany or the United States) or different
voting configuration in a unitary system (as in France). In the UK the upper
house is appointed by the government as a _h_o_u_s_e_ _o_f_ _r_e_v_i_e_w. One criticism of
bicameral systems with two elected chambers is that the upper and lower houses
may simply mirror one another. The traditional justification of bicameralism is
that an upper chamber acts as a house of review. This can minimise
arbitrariness and injustice in governmental action._[_1_5_2_]
To pass legislation, a majority of the members of a legislature must _v_o_t_e for a
_b_i_l_l_ _(_p_r_o_p_o_s_e_d_ _l_a_w_) in each house. Normally there will be several readings and
amendments proposed by the different political factions. If a country has an
entrenched constitution, a special majority for changes to the constitution may
be required, making changes to the law more difficult. A government usually
leads the process, which can be formed from Members of Parliament (e.g. the UK
or Germany). However, in a presidential system, the government is usually
formed by an executive and his or her appointed cabinet officials (e.g. the
United States or Brazil)._[_1_5_3_]

The _G_2_0 meetings are composed of representatives of each country's executive
branch
The executive in a legal system serves as a government's centre of political
_a_u_t_h_o_r_i_t_y. In a _p_a_r_l_i_a_m_e_n_t_a_r_y_ _s_y_s_t_e_m, as with Britain, Italy, Germany, India,
and Japan, the executive is known as the cabinet, and composed of members of
the legislature. The executive is chosen by the Prime Minister or _C_h_a_n_c_e_l_l_o_r,
whose office holds power under the _c_o_n_f_i_d_e_n_c_e of the legislature. Because
popular elections appoint political parties to govern, the leader of a party
can change in between elections._[_1_5_4_]
The _h_e_a_d_ _o_f_ _s_t_a_t_e is apart from the executive, and symbolically enacts laws and
acts as representative of the nation. Examples include the _G_e_r_m_a_n_ _p_r_e_s_i_d_e_n_t
(appointed by members of federal and state Parliaments) the _Q_u_e_e_n_ _o_f_ _t_h_e_ _U_n_i_t_e_d
_K_i_n_g_d_o_m (a _h_e_r_e_d_i_t_a_r_y title), and the _A_u_s_t_r_i_a_n_ _p_r_e_s_i_d_e_n_t (elected by popular
vote). The other important model is the _p_r_e_s_i_d_e_n_t_i_a_l_ _s_y_s_t_e_m, found in France,
the U.S. and Russia. In presidential systems, the executive acts as both head
of state and head of government, and has power to appoint an unelected cabinet.
Under a presidential system, the executive branch is separate from the
legislature to which it is not accountable._[_1_5_4_]_[_1_5_5_]
Although the role of the executive varies from country to country, usually it
will propose the majority of legislation, and propose government agenda. In
presidential systems, the executive often has the power to veto legislation.
Most executives in both systems are responsible for _f_o_r_e_i_g_n_ _r_e_l_a_t_i_o_n_s, the
military and police, and the bureaucracy. _M_i_n_i_s_t_e_r_s or other officials head a
country's public offices, such as a _f_o_r_e_i_g_n_ _m_i_n_i_s_t_r_y or _i_n_t_e_r_i_o_r_ _m_i_n_i_s_t_r_y. The
election of a different executive is therefore capable of revolutionising an
entire country's approach to government.

While military organizations have existed as long as government itself, the
idea of a standing police force is a relatively modern concept. For example,

_t_r_i_a_l_s and public executions to instill communities with fear to maintain
control._[_1_5_6_] The first modern police were probably those in 17th-century

The etymology of "bureaucracy" derives from the French word for "office"
(bureau) and the _A_n_c_i_e_n_t_ _G_r_e_e_k for word "power" (kratos)._[_1_6_2_] Like the
military and police, a legal system's government servants and bodies that make
up its bureaucracy carry out the directives of the executive. One of the
earliest references to the concept was made by _B_a_r_o_n_ _d_e_ _G_r_i_m_m, a German author
who lived in France. In 1765 he wrote,
     The real spirit of the laws in France is that bureaucracy of which
     the late Monsieur de Gournay used to complain so greatly; here the
     offices, clerks, secretaries, inspectors and intendants are not
     appointed to benefit the public interest, indeed the public interest
     appears to have been established so that offices might exist._[_1_6_3_]
Cynicism over "officialdom" is still common, and the workings of public
servants is typically contrasted to _p_r_i_v_a_t_e_ _e_n_t_e_r_p_r_i_s_e motivated by _p_r_o_f_i_t.
_[_1_6_4_] In fact private companies, especially large ones, also have
bureaucracies._[_1_6_5_] Negative perceptions of "_r_e_d_ _t_a_p_e" aside, public services
such as schooling, health care, policing or public transport are a crucial
state function making public bureaucratic action the locus of government power.
_[_1_6_5_]
Writing in the early 20th century, Max Weber believed that a definitive feature
of a developed state had come to be its bureaucratic support._[_1_6_6_] Weber wrote
that the typical characteristics of modern bureaucracy are that officials
define its mission, the scope of work is bound by rules, management is composed
of career experts, who manage top down, communicating through writing and
binding public servants' discretion with rules._[_1_6_7_]

In civil law systems such as those of France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Greece,
there is a distinct category of _n_o_t_a_r_y, a legally trained public official,
compensated by the parties to a transaction._[_1_6_8_] This is a 16th-century

A corollary of the rule of law is the existence of a legal profession
sufficiently autonomous to invoke the authority of the independent judiciary;
the right to assistance of an _a_d_v_o_c_a_t_e in a court proceeding emanates from this
corollaryâin England the function of barrister or advocate is distinguished
from legal counselor (solicitor)._[_1_6_9_] As the European Court of Human Rights
