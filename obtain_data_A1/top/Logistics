LLooggiissttiiccss is the _m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t of the flow of _r_e_s_o_u_r_c_e_s between the point of
origin and the point of consumption in order to meet some requirements, for
example, of customers or corporations. The resources managed in logistics can
include physical items, such as food, materials, equipment, liquids, and staff,
as well as abstract items, such as time, information, particles, and energy.
The logistics of physical items usually involves the integration of information
flow, _m_a_t_e_r_i_a_l_ _h_a_n_d_l_i_n_g, _p_r_o_d_u_c_t_i_o_n, _p_a_c_k_a_g_i_n_g, _i_n_v_e_n_t_o_r_y, _t_r_a_n_s_p_o_r_t_a_t_i_o_n,

analyzed, visualized, and optimized by dedicated simulation software. The
minimization of the use of resources is a common motivation.

The term logistics comes from the late 19th century: from French logistique
(loger means to _l_o_d_g_e)._[_1_]
Logistics is considered to have originated in the military's need to supply
itself with arms, ammunition, and rations as it moved from a base to a forward
position. In the ancient _G_r_e_e_k, _R_o_m_a_n, and _B_y_z_a_n_t_i_n_e_ _E_m_p_i_r_e_s, military officers
with the title Logistikas were responsible for financial and supply
distribution matters.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]

_s_c_i_e_n_c_e relating to procuring, maintaining and transporting _m_a_t_e_r_i_a_l, personnel
and facilities." However, the _N_e_w_ _O_x_f_o_r_d_ _A_m_e_r_i_c_a_n_ _D_i_c_t_i_o_n_a_r_y defines logistics
as "the detailed coordination of a complex operation involving many people,
facilities, or supplies", and the Oxford Dictionary online defines it as "the
detailed organization and implementation of a complex operation"._[_2_] Another
dictionary definition is "the time-related positioning of resources". As such,
logistics is commonly seen as a branch of _e_n_g_i_n_e_e_r_i_n_g that creates "people
systems" rather than "machine systems".
According to the Council of Logistics Management, logistics includes the
integrated planning, control, realization, and monitoring of all internal and
network-wide material, part, and product flow, including the necessary
information flow, industrial and trading companies along the complete value-
added chain (and product life cycle) for the purpose of conforming to customer
requirements.
Logistics is the process of planning, implementing, and controlling the
effective and efficient flow of goods and services from the point of origin to
the point of consumption

The _U_n_i_t_e_d_ _S_t_a_t_e_s_ _A_r_m_e_d_ _F_o_r_c_e_s' categorical _s_u_p_p_l_y_ _c_l_a_s_s_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n was developed
in such a way that categories of supply with similar consumption variables are
grouped together for planning purposes. For instance, peacetime consumption of
ammunition and fuel will be considerably lower than wartime consumption of
these items, whereas other classes of supply such as subsistence and clothing
have a relatively consistent consumption rate regardless of war or peace.
Some classes of supply have a linear demand relationship: as more troops are
added, more supply items are needed; or as more equipment is used, more fuel
and ammunition are consumed. Other classes of supply must consider a third
variable besides usage and quantity: time. As equipment ages, more and more
_r_e_p_a_i_r_ _p_a_r_t_s are needed over time, even when usage and quantity stays
consistent. By recording and analyzing these trends over time and applying them
to future scenarios, the US Armed Forces can accurately supply troops with the
items necessary at the precise moment they are needed._[_3_] History has shown
that good logistical planning creates a lean and efficient fighting force. The
lack thereof can lead to a clunky, slow, and ill-equipped force with too much
or too little supply.

One definition of business logistics speaks of "having the right item in the
right quantity at the right time at the right place for the right price in the
right condition to the right customer"._[_4_] As the science of process[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n

resultant efficiencies.
Logistics as a _b_u_s_i_n_e_s_s concept evolved in the 1950s[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] due to
the increasing complexity of supplying businesses with materials and shipping
out products in an increasingly globalized supply chain, leading to a call for
experts called "supply chain logisticians".
In business, logistics may have either an internal focus (inbound logistics) or
an external focus (outbound logistics), covering the flow and storage of
materials from point of origin to point of consumption (see _s_u_p_p_l_y_-_c_h_a_i_n
_m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t). The main functions of a qualified logistician include _i_n_v_e_n_t_o_r_y
_m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t, _p_u_r_c_h_a_s_i_n_g, _t_r_a_n_s_p_o_r_t_a_t_i_o_n, _w_a_r_e_h_o_u_s_i_n_g, consultation, and the
organizing and _p_l_a_n_n_i_n_g of these activities. Logisticians combine a
professional knowledge of each of these functions to coordinate resources in an
organization.
There are two fundamentally different forms of logistics: one optimizes a
steady flow of material through a network of _t_r_a_n_s_p_o_r_t links and storage nodes,
while the other coordinates a _s_e_q_u_e_n_c_e of resources to carry out some _p_r_o_j_e_c_t.

A logistic family is a set of products which share a common characteristic:
weight and volumetric characteristics, physical storing needs (temperature,
radiation,...), handling needs, order frequency, package size, etc. The
following metrics maybe used by the company to organize its products in
different families. Physical metrics used to evaluate inventory systems include
stocking capacity, selectivity, superficial utilization, volumetric
utilization, transport capacity, transport capacity utilization. Monetary
metrics used include space holding costs (building, shelving and services) and
handling costs (people, handling machinery, energy and maintenance)._[_5_]

The term production logistics describes logistic processes within an _i_n_d_u_s_t_r_y.
Production logistics aims to ensure that each machine and workstation receives
the right product in the right quantity and quality at the right time. The
concern is not the transportation itself, but to streamline and control the
flow through value-adding processes and to eliminate nonâvalue-adding
processes. Production logistics can operate in existing as well as new plants.
Manufacturing in an existing plant is a constantly changing process.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n
_n_e_e_d_e_d] Machines are exchanged and new ones added, which gives the opportunity
to improve the production logistics system accordingly. Production logistics
provides the means to achieve customer response and capital efficiency.
Production logistics becomes more important with decreasing batch sizes. In
many industries (e.g., _m_o_b_i_l_e_ _p_h_o_n_e_s), the short-term goal is a batch size of
one, allowing even a single customer's demand to be fulfilled efficiently.

product safety and reliability issues, is also gaining importance, especially
in the _a_u_t_o_m_o_t_i_v_e and _m_e_d_i_c_a_l industries.

Although there is some overlap in functionality, warehouse management systems
(WMS) can differ significantly from warehouse control systems (WCS). Simply
put, a WMS plans a weekly activity forecast based on such factors as statistics
and trends, whereas a WCS acts like a floor supervisor, working in real time to
get the job done by the most effective means. For instance, a WMS can tell the
system that it is going to need five of _s_t_o_c_k_-_k_e_e_p_i_n_g_ _u_n_i_t (SKU) A and five of
SKU B hours in advance, but by the time it acts, other considerations may have
come into play or there could be a logjam on a conveyor. A WCS can prevent that
problem by working in real time and adapting to the situation by making a last-
minute decision based on current activity and operational status. Working
_s_y_n_e_r_g_i_s_t_i_c_a_l_l_y, WMS and WCS can resolve these issues and maximize _e_f_f_i_c_i_e_n_c_y

Third-party logistics (3PL) involves using external organizations to execute
logistics activities that have traditionally been performed within an
organization itself._[_1_0_] According to this definition, third-party logistics
includes any form of outsourcing of logistics activities previously performed
in house. For example, if a company with its own warehousing facilities decides
to employ external transportation, this would be an example of third-party
logistics. Logistics is an emerging business area in many countries.

The concept of a fourth-party logistics (4PL) provider was first defined by
Andersen Consulting (now _A_c_c_e_n_t_u_r_e) as an integrator that assembles the
resources, capabilities, and technology of its own organization and other
organizations to design, build, and run comprehensive supply chain solutions.
Whereas a third-party logistics (3PL) service provider targets a single
function, a 4PL targets management of the entire process. Some have described a
4PL as a general contractor that manages other 3PLs, truckers, forwarders,
custom house agents, and others, essentially taking responsibility of a
complete process for the customer.

used to move goods or objects rapidly in the event of an emergency.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n
_n_e_e_d_e_d] The reason for enlisting emergency logistics services could be a
production delay or anticipated production delay, or an urgent need for
specialized equipment to prevent events such as aircraft being grounded (also
known as "aircraft on ground"âAOG), ships being delayed, or
telecommunications failure. Emergency logistics services are typically sourced
from a specialist provider.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]
