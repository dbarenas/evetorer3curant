In the broadest sense, mmeerrcchhaannddiissiinngg is any practice which contributes to the
sale of products to a retail consumer. At a retail in-store level,
merchandising refers to the variety of products available for sale and the
display of those products in such a way that it stimulates interest and entices
customers to make a purchase.

In Retail commerce, visual display merchandising means merchandise _s_a_l_e_s using
_p_r_o_d_u_c_t_ _d_e_s_i_g_n, selection, _p_a_c_k_a_g_i_n_g, _p_r_i_c_i_n_g, and display that stimulates
consumers to spend more. This includes disciplines and _d_i_s_c_o_u_n_t_i_n_g, physical
presentation of products and displays, and the decisions about which products
should be presented to which customers at what time.This annual cycle of
merchandising differs between countries and even within them, particularly
relating to cultural customs like holidays, and seasonal issues like climate
and local sporting and recreation. In the United States for example, the basic
retail cycle begins in early January with merchandise for _V_a_l_e_n_t_i_n_e_'_s_ _D_a_y,
which is not until mid-February. _P_r_e_s_i_d_e_n_t_s_'_ _D_a_y sales are held shortly
thereafter. Following this, _E_a_s_t_e_r is the major holiday, while springtime
clothing and garden-related merchandise is already arriving at stores, often as
early as mid-winter (toward the beginning of this section, _S_t_._ _P_a_t_r_i_c_k_'_s_ _D_a_y
merchandise, including green items and products pertaining to Irish culture, is
also promoted). _M_o_t_h_e_r_s_ _D_a_y and _F_a_t_h_e_r_s_ _D_a_y are next, with _g_r_a_d_u_a_t_i_o_n gifts
(typically small _c_o_n_s_u_m_e_r_ _e_l_e_c_t_r_o_n_i_c_s like _d_i_g_i_t_a_l_ _c_a_m_e_r_a_s) often being
marketed as "dads and grads" in June (though most college semesters end in May;
the grads portion usually refers to high school graduation, which ends one to
two weeks after Father's Day in many U.S. states). Summer merchandise is next,
including patriotic-themed products with the American flag, out by _M_e_m_o_r_i_a_l_ _D_a_y
in preparation for _I_n_d_e_p_e_n_d_e_n_c_e_ _D_a_y (with _F_l_a_g_ _D_a_y in between). By July, _b_a_c_k_-
_t_o_-_s_c_h_o_o_l is on the shelves and autumn merchandise is already arriving, and at
some _a_r_t_s_ _a_n_d_ _c_r_a_f_t_s stores, _C_h_r_i_s_t_m_a_s_ _d_e_c_o_r_a_t_i_o_n_s. (Often, a _C_h_r_i_s_t_m_a_s_ _i_n_ _J_u_l_y
celebration is held around this time.) The back-to-school market is promoted
heavily in August, a time when there are no holidays to promote. By September,
particularly after _L_a_b_o_r_ _D_a_y, the summer merchandise is on final _c_l_o_s_e_o_u_t and
_o_v_e_r_s_t_o_c_k of school supplies is marked-down some as well, and _H_a_l_l_o_w_e_e_n (and
often even more of the Christmas) merchandise is appearing. As the Halloween
decorations and costumes dwindle in October, Christmas is already being pushed
on consumers, and by the day after Halloween retailers are going full-force
with advertising, even though the "official" season doesn't start until _t_h_e_ _d_a_y
_a_f_t_e_r _T_h_a_n_k_s_g_i_v_i_n_g. Christmas clearance sales now begin even before Christmas
at most retailers, though they usually begin on _t_h_e_ _d_a_y_ _a_f_t_e_r_ _C_h_r_i_s_t_m_a_s and
continue on at least until _N_e_w_ _Y_e_a_r_'_s_ _D_a_y but sometimes as far out as February.
Merchandising also varies within _r_e_t_a_i_l_ _c_h_a_i_n_s, where stores in places like
_B_u_f_f_a_l_o might carry _s_n_o_w_ _b_l_o_w_e_r_s, while stores in _F_l_o_r_i_d_a and _s_o_u_t_h_e_r_n
_C_a_l_i_f_o_r_n_i_a might instead carry beach clothing and barbecue grills all year.
Coastal-area stores might carry _w_a_t_e_r_ _s_k_i_i_n_g equipment, while ones near
_m_o_u_n_t_a_i_n_ _r_a_n_g_e_s would likely have _s_n_o_w_ _s_k_i_i_n_g and _s_n_o_w_b_o_a_r_d_i_n_g gear if there
are ski areas nearby.so you can solve the merchandising problem through the
proper supply chain management system

In Eastern Europe, particularly in Russia, the term ‚Äúmerchandising‚Äù is
commonly used within the trading industry and denotes all marketing and sales
stimulation activities around PoS (point of sale): design, creation, promotion,
care and training of the sales staff. A merchandiser is someone who is
continuously involved in business promotion by buying and selling of goods. In
Asian countries, such as India, this term is more synonymous with activities
right from sampling and idea conception to dispatching of the shipment. It is a
job description that involves leading and working with different departments
within the organization, suppliers and buyers to deal with timely deadlines and
accepted quality levels.

Merchandising at a _W_a_l_g_r_e_e_n_s in Chicago
In the _s_u_p_p_l_y_ _c_h_a_i_n, merchandising is the practice of making products in retail
outlets available to consumers, primarily by stocking shelves and displays.
While this used to be done exclusively by the stores' employees, many retailers
have found substantial savings in requiring it to be done by the manufacturer,
vendor, or wholesaler that provides the products to the retail store. In the
United Kingdom there are a number of organizations that supply merchandising
services to support retail outlets with general stock replenishment and
merchandising support in new stores. By doing this, retail stores have been
able to substantially reduce the number of employees needed to run the store.
While stocking shelves and building displays is often done when the product is
delivered, it is increasingly a separate activity from delivering the product.
In grocery stores, for example, almost all products delivered directly to the
store from a manufacturer or wholesaler will be stocked by the manufacturer's/
wholesaler's employee who is a full-time merchandiser. Product categories where
this is common are Beverage (all types, alcoholic and non-alcoholic), packaged
baked goods (bread and pastries), magazines and books, and health and beauty
products. For major food manufacturers in the beverage and baked goods
industries, their merchandisers are often the single largest employee group
within the company. For nationwide branded goods manufacturers such as The
Coca-Cola Company and _P_e_p_s_i_C_o, their respective merchandiser work forces number
in the thousands.

In _m_a_r_k_e_t_i_n_g, one of the definitions of merchandising is the practice in which
the brand or image from one product or service is used to sell another.
_T_r_a_d_e_m_a_r_k_e_d brand names, logos, or character images are licensed to
manufacturers of products such as toys or clothing, which then make items in or
emblazoned with the image of the license, hoping they'll sell better than the
same item with no such image._[_1_] For the owners of the IP (_i_n_t_e_l_l_e_c_t_u_a_l
_p_r_o_p_e_r_t_y) in question, merchandising is a very popular source of revenue, due
to the low cost of letting a third party manufacture the merchandise, while the
IP owners collect the merchandising fees.

Merchandising for children is most prominently seen in connection with _f_i_l_m_s
and games, usually those in current release and with _t_e_l_e_v_i_s_i_o_n shows oriented
towards children.
Merchandising, especially in connection with child-oriented films and TV shows,
often consists of toys made in the likeness of the show's characters (action
figures) or items which they use. However, sometimes it can be the other way
around, with the show written to include the toys, as advertising for the
merchandise. The first major example of this was the TV show "G.I. JOE A Real
American Hero.," produced by Hasbro in the early 1980s, but this practice has
been common in children's broadcasting ever since.
Sometimes merchandising from a television show can grow far beyond the original
show, even lasting decades after the show has largely disappeared from
popularity. In other cases, large amounts of merchandise can be generated from
a pitifully small amount of source material (_M_a_s_h_i_m_a_r_o).

The most common adult-oriented merchandising is that related to _p_r_o_f_e_s_s_i_o_n_a_l
_s_p_o_r_t_s teams (and their players).
A smaller niche in merchandising is the marketing of more adult-oriented
products in connection with similarly adult-oriented films and TV shows. This
is common especially with the _s_c_i_e_n_c_e_ _f_i_c_t_i_o_n and _h_o_r_r_o_r _g_e_n_r_e_s. (Examples:
_S_t_a_r_ _T_r_e_k, _M_c_F_a_r_l_a_n_e_ _T_o_y_s) Occasionally shows which were intended more for
children find a following among adults, and you can see a bit of a crossover,
with products from that show oriented towards both adults and children. (_G_u_n_d_a_m
_m_o_d_e_l_ _k_i_t_s) An early example of this phenomenon was the cartoon character
Little Lulu, who became licensed to products for adults, such as Kleenex facial
tissue._[_2_]
Sometimes a _b_r_a_n_d of non-media products can achieve enough recognition and
respect that simply putting its name or images on a completely unrelated item
can sell that item. (An example would be _H_a_r_l_e_y_-_D_a_v_i_d_s_o_n branded clothing.)

Yet another path official merchandising follows sometimes is the one so-called
_p_r_o_p_ _r_e_p_l_i_c_a market. Mainly focused on fan-made articles, prop replicas are
becoming more and more famous as users tend to collect those pieces of movie

levels of quality than certain 'licensed' replicas.
