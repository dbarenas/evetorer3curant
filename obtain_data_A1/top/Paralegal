Generally speaking, a ppaarraalleeggaall is a _p_a_r_a_p_r_o_f_e_s_s_i_o_n_a_l who has the required

_O_n_t_a_r_i_o, _C_a_n_a_d_a, paralegals are licensed by the Law Society of Upper Canada._[_1_]
Ontario is the only jurisdiction in the western hemisphere where paralegals are
licensed and the profession is regulated as officers of the court. Licensed
paralegals operate within a defined scope of practice, representing clients in
matters such as provincial offences (traffic tickets, etc.), immigration,
landlord & tenant disputes, labor law, small claims court (under $25,000), and
specific criminal matters. They are currently not permitted to represent
clients in family court or wills and estates. By virtue of their office,
licensed paralegals are Commissioners for Taking Affidavits (swearing oaths).
The definition of "paralegal" varies by country. In the United States, they are
not authorized by the government or other agency to offer legal services in the
same way, nor are they officers of the court, nor are they usually subject to
government-sanctioned or court-sanctioned rules of conduct. In contrast, in
_O_n_t_a_r_i_o, _C_a_n_a_d_a, paralegals are licensed and regulated the same way that
lawyers are. In Ontario, licensed paralegals provide permitted legal services
to the public and appear before certain lower level courts and administrative
tribunals.
The definition of a paralegal is a person trained in legal matters, who
performs routine tasks requiring some knowledge of the law and procedures. A
paralegal, like a lawyer, can be employed by a law office or work freelance. An
unlicensed paralegal is supervised by a lawyer and cannot engage in the
practice of law. Usually, paralegals have taken a prescribed series of courses
in law and legal processes. Paralegals often handle much of the paper work in
probates of estates, divorce actions, bankruptcies, investigations, analyzing
depositions, preparing and answering interrogatories, procedural motions, and
other specialized jobs.
In the United States, paralegals originated as assistants to lawyers at a time
when only lawyers offered legal services. In those jurisdictions, such as the
_U_n_i_t_e_d_ _S_t_a_t_e_s, where the local legal profession/judiciary is involved in
paralegal recognition/accreditation, the profession of paralegal still
basically refers to those people working under the direct supervision of a
lawyer. The profession of paralegal varies greatly between the states, due to
the fact that some states do require paralegals to be licensed. In other
jurisdictions however, such as the _U_n_i_t_e_d_ _K_i_n_g_d_o_m, the lack of local legal
profession/judiciary oversight means that the definition of paralegal
encompasses non-lawyers doing legal work, regardless of whom they do it for.
Although most jurisdictions recognize paralegals to a greater or lesser extent,
there is no international consistency as to definition, job-role, status, terms
and conditions of employment, training, regulation or anything else and so each
jurisdiction must be looked at individually.

Various legal organizations offer official definitions of a paralegal: these
definitions typically have slight differences. Definitions offered by major
organizations include:
    * From the Paralegal Society of Ontario: "A paralegal is an individual
      qualified through education or experience licensed to provide legal
      services to the general public in areas authorized by the Law Society of
      Upper Canada_[_2_]
    * From the United Kingdom's _N_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _A_s_s_o_c_i_a_t_i_o_n_ _o_f_ _L_i_c_e_n_s_e_d_ _P_a_r_a_l_e_g_a_l_s: 'A

    * From the _A_m_e_r_i_c_a_n_ _B_a_r_ _A_s_s_o_c_i_a_t_i_o_n: "A legal assistant or paralegal is a

      employed or retained by a lawyer, law office, corporation, governmental
      agency or other entity who performs specifically delegated substantive
      legal work for which a lawyer is responsible." Under this definition, the
      legal responsibility for a paralegal's work rests directly and solely
      upon the lawyer._[_3_]
    * From the National Federation of Paralegal Associations (NFPA) [USA]: "A
      paralegal is a person, qualified through education, training or work
      experience to perform substantive legal work that requires knowledge of
      legal concepts and is customarily, but not exclusively, performed by a
      lawyer. This person may be retained or employed by a lawyer, law office,
      governmental agency or other entity or may be authorized by
      administrative, statutory or court authority to perform this work.
      Substantive shall mean work requiring recognition, evaluation,
      organization, analysis, and communication of relevant facts and legal
      concepts."_[_4_]
    * From the National Association of Legal Assistants (NALA) [USA]: "Legal
      assistants, also known as paralegals, are a distinguishable group of
      persons who assist attorneys in the delivery of legal services. Through
      formal education, training and experience, legal assistants have
      knowledge and expertise regarding the legal system and substantive and
      procedural law which qualify them to do work of a legal nature under the
      supervision of an attorney." In 2001, NALA adopted the ABA's definition
      of a paralegal or legal assistant as an addition to its definition._[_5_]
    * From the American Association for Paralegal Education (AAfPE):
      "Paralegals perform substantive and procedural legal work as authorized
      by law, which work, in the absence of the paralegal, would be performed
      by an attorney. Paralegals have knowledge of the law gained through
      education, or education and work experience, which qualifies them to
      perform legal work. Paralegals adhere to recognized ethical standards and
      rules of professional responsibility."_[_6_]
    * From the United Kingdom's Institute of Paralegals: "A paralegal is a non-
      lawyer who does legal work that previously would have been done by a
      lawyer, or if done by a lawyer, would be charged for."
    * From the International Paralegal Management Association (IPMA) "A legal
      assistant or paralegal is a person qualified by education, training or
      work experience who is employed or retained by a lawyer, law office,
      corporation, governmental agency or other entity who performs
      specifically delegated substantive legal work for which a lawyer is

The greatest differences between lawyers and paralegals are that lawyers give
legal advice, can set fees, appear as counsel of record in court, and sign
pleadings (and other court documents) in a representative capacity. A paralegal
who attempts to do any of these acts will be in violation of the _u_n_a_u_t_h_o_r_i_z_e_d
_p_r_a_c_t_i_c_e_ _o_f_ _l_a_w statutes in most U.S. states. Paralegals are responsible for
handling tasks such as legal writing, research and other forms of documentation
for the lawyers for whom they work.
Other traditional differences between a paralegal and a lawyer (i.e. attorney)
is that:
   1. paralegal expertise/training tends to be niche, whereas a lawyer has a
      much broader, more formal and holistic training, and
   2. that the lawyer's primary job is to consider, analyze and strategize,
      whereas a paralegal's primary responsibility is to carry out the tasks
      arising from that consideration, analysis and strategy.
Paralegals are found in all areas where United States lawyers work‚Äîin
_c_r_i_m_i_n_a_l_ _t_r_i_a_l_s, in _r_e_a_l_ _e_s_t_a_t_e, in government, in _e_s_t_a_t_e_ _p_l_a_n_n_i_n_g.
In some areas, legal document assistants actually advertise themselves as
paralegals. Many states, including Florida, have enacted laws or bar rules
which require any person referring to himself or herself as a paralegal to work
under the supervision of a licensed attorney._[_9_] This rule would prohibit those
individuals working as "independent paralegals" from using the title
"paralegal".

In Ontario, Canada, a paralegal can apply to the Ministry of the Attorney
General to be appointed as a Commissioner for Taking Affidavits (also known in
some jurisdictions as a Commissioner of/for Oaths; the equivalent of a _N_o_t_a_r_y
_P_u_b_l_i_c in the United States). If a paralegal holds a valid licence, they are
assumed to be a member in good standing with the Law Society of Upper
Canada.All applicants (regardless of background or standing) are subject to a
criminal background check, and depending upon its outcome, a time-limited
commission will be granted.
This link is not necessarily the norm in other jurisdictions. In the United
Kingdom for example, notaries are a distinct group, and tend to be solicitors.
In the United States, a _N_o_t_a_r_y_ _P_u_b_l_i_c does not require any legal training, and
may be commissioned regardless of their profession or occupation.
In the United States, a legal secretary is generally a secretary who has a
basic understanding of legal terminology and the specific formatting required
by a particular court or government agency. Legal secretaries are also
typically responsible for keeping case files organized and indexed, often
taking on the duties of a _f_i_l_e_ _c_l_e_r_k. Although legal secretaries may be trained
to prepare some basic legal papers and letters, they generally have little or
no knowledge of particular legal doctrines, statutes or regulations, and
typically have no training or experience in conducting legal research or draft
legal documents, pleadings, motions, briefs or other court papers. On the other
hand, a typical paralegal in the United States can perform all of these tasks
under the supervision of an attorney.

In Canada, paralegals are legal agents who have the ability to represent on
many matters, including all Provincial Offences, work for Provincial Tribunals
and Boards, as well as Summary Criminal Cases. They are not "law clerks" in the
province of Ontario, Canada and are considered to be a formal part of the legal
system. Paralegals may become Commissioners, Notaries Public and act as a
Justice of the Peace.
In the Province of Ontario, a paralegal is an _o_f_f_i_c_e_r_ _o_f_ _t_h_e_ _c_o_u_r_t (i.e.
considered a formal part of the _l_e_g_a_l_ _s_y_s_t_e_m). Paralegals in Ontario are
licensed and regulated by the Law Society of Upper Canada, which also regulates
and provides licenses for all lawyers in Ontario. The Law Society began issuing
the first paralegal licences to grandparent applicants who fulfilled all the
necessary licensing requirements (including insurance) in April 2008._[_1_0_]
Paralegals who provide legal services to the public must carry _p_r_o_f_e_s_s_i_o_n_a_l

Licensees must provide written proof of their compliance with this requirement
to carry mandatory insurance before they begin providing legal services, as
well as on an annual basis._[_1_0_] Paralegal services may be provided via a sole

encouraged to seek professional advice on the best business structure for their
particular situations._[_1_0_] A paralegal license allows a paralegal to
independently represent clients in provincial offences court, summary
conviction criminal court, small claims court and administrative tribunals such
as the Financial Services Commission of Ontario or the Workplace Safety and
Insurance Board. The role that a paralegal has in the United States is similar
to the role of a law clerk or legal assistant in Ontario. Many paralegals in
Ontario work in the areas of permitted practice for paralegals and also work
alongside lawyers in areas of practice that are only permitted to be practiced
by lawyers. It is illegal for paralegals in Ontario to independently practice
in an area of law that is permitted only for lawyers. An example of this is
family law, or an indictable offence in criminal law.

All Lawyers and paralegals who practise law and provide legal services in
Ontario, are required to complete the CPD program.
Continuing professional development (CPD) is the maintenance and enhancement of
a lawyer or paralegal's professional knowledge, skills, attitudes and
professionalism throughout the individual's career. It is a positive tool that
benefits lawyers and paralegals and is an essential component of the commitment
they make to the public to practise law or provide legal services competently
and ethically._[_1_1_]

In the United States, paralegals have taken many different paths to their
careers. These paths comprise an array of varying levels of education,
different certifications, and on-the-job-training. They work in government, for
_l_a_w_ _f_i_r_m_s, for _c_o_r_p_o_r_a_t_i_o_n_s, for real estate firms, and for nonprofit
organizations. Where they work and what they do often depends on what mixture
of experience, skills, education, and certification they possess.
****** IInn ggeenneerraall[[_ee_dd_ii_tt]] ******
Some paralegals have only on-the-job experience, while other paralegals have
completed a formal program. Formal training programs may result in an
associate's degree, bachelor's degree, or _m_a_s_t_e_r_'_s_ _d_e_g_r_e_e. Some paralegals
holding a degree in another field have earned a supplementary certificate in
paralegal studies._[_1_2_] Others have completed an associate's, bachelor's or a
master's degree in another field. Many paralegals have completed all of their
training before entering the profession, while others have completed their
education while working their way up from the mailroom in a law firm. Many
paralegals take Continuing Legal Education (CLE) courses to fulfill the
requirements of their firm, state, or association.
There has been little or no regulation of legal assistants or paralegals in the
United States in the past. There is a current trend towards regulation or self-
regulation. For example, _t_h_e_ _F_l_o_r_i_d_a_ _B_a_r has a paralegal registration program,
which is voluntary. Florida bar rules prohibit a non-attorney who is not
working under the supervision of an attorney from advertising himself or
herself as a paralegal.

Up until Bus & Prof. Code ¬ß 6450 was signed into law by _C_a_l_i_f_o_r_n_i_a Governor
_G_r_a_y_ _D_a_v_i_s in 2000, there was little, if any regulation of paralegals in that
state. The purpose of regulation under ¬ß 6450 was to shut down the paralegals
who were providing self-help legal services to consumers.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]
There had been relatively few consumer complaints against paralegals; instead
most of the complaints were from lawyers who urged the California State Bar to
police the unauthorized practice of law.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] In response, the
State Bar appointed a Public Protection Committee to look at the L.A. bar's
claim.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]
Then, "in 1988, the Public Protection Committee unanimously recommended that
the California legislature completely abolish the state's UPL laws. It further
concluded that independent paralegals should be allowed to provide all types of
legal services as long as they are registered with a state agency and disclose
their non-lawyer status to all customers." After many local bar associations
reacted in dismay, "The California Bar then appointed a third group (The
Commission on Legal Technicians) to restudy the issue. This commission largely
agreed with the conclusions of its predecessors and recommended that nonlawyers
be authorized by the California Supreme Court to deliver legal services in
several major areas (bankruptcy, family, immigration, and landlord-tenant),
under the terms of a licensing scheme that would be supervised by an
independent state agency."_[_1_3_]
This development culminated in paralegals being forced to give up the title
paralegal for Legal Document Assistant (LDA) under California Bus & Prof. Code
¬ß 6400. Yet, they were the ones who popularized the title paralegal, since the
public viewed paralegals as providers of affordable legal services.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n
_n_e_e_d_e_d] Since 2000, the term paralegal has been consolidated into a one size
fits all. Paralegals now find themselves in subservient support roles working
for lawyers who control them, along with the paralegal associations that ensure
those control measures stay in place through their guidelines that paralegals
must to work under the supervision of lawyers._[_1_4_]

Paralegals are restrained from exercising independence and prohibited from
providing even basic legal advice. In her book, Access to Justice, Stanford law
professor Deborah Rhode states: ‚ÄúOver four-fifths of surveyed attorneys have
supported prosecution of lay practitioners, and the profession has repeatedly
blocked licensing proposals that would enable independent paralegals to offer
routine services. Many local, state and national bar associations have recently
launched initiatives to broaden the definition, raise the penalties, and
increase the enforcement of unauthorized practice prohibitions.‚Äù_[_1_5_]

The Institute of Legal Executives (ILEX) has been established for almost 50
years, and was launched with the blessing of the Law Society. It regulates
15,000 trainee and 7,000 practising Legal Executive lawyers through an MOJ

become fully qualified lawyers, advocates, partners and judges, subject to
achieving the correct level of qualifications, skills, and experience.

In the United States, there is no such thing as a paralegal licensed by a
government body; rather, paralegals can be "registered," "certified," or
certificated.
There are two major national organizations that offer professional
certification to paralegals who meet voluntary regulation standards: the

Both NALA and the NFPA offer non-accredited professional certification exams
that should not be confused with a paralegal certificate offered by an
officially accredited college or university. A paralegal certification is not
the equivalent of a certification issued by a body that has achieved formal
accreditation through NNaattiioonnaall CCoommmmiissssiioonn ffoorr CCeerrttiiffyyiinngg AAggeenncciieess ((_NN_CC_CC_AA)) or

certification the equivalent of a paralegal certificate awarded by an

NALA offers its non-accredited Certified Legal Assistant or Certified Paralegal
examination, a comprehensive two-day examination that covers the following
subjects: Communications, Ethics, Legal Research, Judgment and Analytical
Ability, American Legal System and four sub-sections selected by the applicants
from a list of nine substantive areas of the law. These sub-section tests cover
general knowledge of the following practice areas: Administrative Law,
Bankruptcy, Business Organizations, Civil Litigation, Contracts, Criminal Law
and Procedure, Estate, Planning and Probate, Family Law and Real Estate. _h_t_t_p_:_/

NALA awards the paralegal the "CLA" (Certified Legal Assistant) or "CP"
(Certified Paralegal) designation. Both the "CLA" and "CP" designations are
proprietary trademarks owned by NALA. Paralegals who have attained further
education and received a paralegal certificate are referred to as
"Certificated" unless they have passed the examination and have been awarded
the "Certified" designation. Additionally, those paralegals who receive the
"Certified Paralegal" designation then have the opportunity to earn the
"Advanced Certified Paralegal" designation. There is a 45 to 50 percent pass
rate for persons taking the NALA exams._[_1_8_]

The NFPA offers its non-accredited Paralegal Advanced Competency Exam, which is
a four-hour exam on a variety of legal topics; those who pass that exam can
call themselves PACE-Registered Paralegals and display the "RP" designation.
_[_1_9_] NFPA‚Äôs core purpose is to advance the paralegal profession and is
committed to the profession‚Äôs Code of Ethics.
In most states, passing an exam administered by an unaccredited entity such as
NALA or the NFPA is similar to an unaccredited school issuing a diploma. It
will have no official recognition and should not be confused with a
certification issued by an accredited organization. The two recognized
accreditors of certifications is NCCA and ANSI. Neither NALA or NFPA are
accredited by them. As such, their certifications are not recognized
benchmarks. Some states have considered the licensure of paralegals. Whether
paralegals should be licensed or certified is one of the most important issues
for paralegals today.

England and Wales. Anyone implying otherwise (i.e. that you need to do a
particular course to qualify) is misrepresenting the position. You become a
paralegal simply by getting a job as a paralegal. The majority of paralegals
still do not have any formal legal qualifications. The only paralegals needing
prior permission before practising are paralegal law firms or paralegal sole

The paralegal phenomenon is a legal-economics argument in all jurisdictions -
they exist precisely because they are not lawyers and thus can do the work much
more cheaply. Other than expertise, the main constraint on what work a
paralegal can or cannot do tends to be local rules that reserve (i.e. give a
monopoly to) particular activities to lawyers. Each jurisdiction tends to have
its own "reserved activities list".

   4. Appear in court on behalf of another (i.e. the client)_[_2_2_]

In the United States, the need for accredited qualifications and bar licensure
limits the number of licensed attorneys. At the same time, there are many legal
tasks for which a bar license is unnecessary but some amount of legal training
is helpful. In order to lower costs, businesses may choose to employ paralegals
to undertake such tasks instead of a more expensive lawyer. Paralegal time is
typically billed at only a fraction of what a lawyer charges, and thus to the
paralegal has fallen those substantive and procedural tasks which are too
complex for _l_e_g_a_l_ _s_e_c_r_e_t_a_r_i_e_s (whose time is not billed) but for which lawyers
can no longer bill. This in turn makes lawyers more efficient by allowing them
to concentrate solely on the substantive legal issues of the case, while
paralegals have become the "case managers."
The growing demand of paralegal professionals at a very rapid rate has resulted
in schools and colleges catering to such education popping up everywhere. It
has been found through a survey that currently 50,000 students are enrolled in
paralegal education courses. The American Association for Paralegal Education
(AAPE) itself has more than 450 members; 260 of them are ABA-approved. Seminars
and events are being held by various institutes to help broaden the knowledge
base of the paralegal service providers and the importance associated with it.
Although the nation is experiencing a recession, the paralegal profession
continues to grow. Law firms and legal departments are cutting costs and
increasing access to legal services by hiring paralegals.
The United Kingdom has gone one step further. Much legal work by lawyers for
the poorer elements of society is _l_e_g_a_l_l_y_ _a_i_d_e_d, or paid for by the state. As
overall costs have risen due to more people than ever engaging with the law,
the government has reduced such legal aid. As a result the work has become
uneconomic for many and they have ceased doing it. Paralegal advisory firms are
stepping in to fill the gap.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]
The increased use of paralegals has slowed the rising cost of legal services
and serves in some small measure (in combination with contingency fees and
insurance) to keep the cost of legal services within the reach of the regular
population. However, one commentator has warned that "our profession makes a
serious error if it uses legal assistants only as economic tools."_[_2_4_]

There are a variety of services available to the general public depending on
our State of residence. These companies have been known as Paralegal Services
until they were required to change their names. These companies are now
typically known to the general public as Court Document Preparers or Court
Forms Providers. The State of Florida has numerous companies that prepare court
documents for a variety of issues, such as Divorce, Bankruptcy, Paternity,
Custody, Modification of Child Support, Name Change, Wills, Power of Attorney,
Quit Claim Deeds, etc. If you do not have the ability to remedy your situation
because of the high cost fees of any attorney a Court Document Preparer can
save thousands of dollars. Such document preparers, however, frequently come
under the scrutiny of various state bar organizations by overstepping the basic
document preparation and engaging in what could be considered "unauthorized
practice of law." Such document preparation is indeed cost-saving for those who
truly want to represent themselves in a legal matter, but want to pay someone
to create the required documents. If problems arise in the legal case, however,
the person who hired the paralegal service needs to understand that there is
typically no legal liability on the part of the paralegal service and that such
institutions cannot be sued for legal malpractice. Again, the philosophy is
that the person utilizing such service is representing himself or herself in
all legal matters and merely hiring a document preparer.

The original concept of paralegals started with the Paralegal Association in
the mid 1980s (now the _N_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _A_s_s_o_c_i_a_t_i_o_n_ _o_f_ _L_i_c_e_n_s_e_d_ _P_a_r_a_l_e_g_a_l_s). However
the oldest incorporated professional body for paralegals in the UK who set the
competency standards for paralegals and legal secretaries, issue legal
qualifications, and support, represent and promote paralegals is the _I_n_s_t_i_t_u_t_e
_O_f_ _P_a_r_a_l_e_g_a_l_s.
Both the Association and Institute have similar roles in recognising and
registering Paralegals but unfortunately do not always agree on all the
principles of practice.
However, it is only recently that paralegals have begun to be seen as more than
merely assistants to lawyers. They are now a newly emergent, and increasingly
distinct, group of legal professionals.
Research shows there to be over 200,000 non-lawyers doing legal work in the
United Kingdom. There are now almost 4,000 government registered/regulated
paralegal advisory firms offering services that would previously have been
offered only by lawyers.
The United Kingdom actually comprises three separate jurisdictions: England and
Wales; Scotland; and Northern Ireland (the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man
are distinct political entities as well as different jurisdictions). Surprising
as it may seem in the United Kingdom anyone may call himself/herself a
paralegal without any qualifications or reistrations. Professional bodies such
as the _N_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _A_s_s_o_c_i_a_t_i_o_n_ _o_f_ _L_i_c_e_n_s_e_d_ _P_a_r_a_l_e_g_a_l_s are lobbying for this to
change, but for the present 'paralegal' is not a protected title.
Paralegals in England and Wales may offer legal advice, as may any person, as
there is no offence such as the unauthorized practice of law - with three
exceptions:
   1. Undertaking the activities reserved to solicitors under the Solicitors
      Act 1974;
   2. Undertaking immigration work if not registered with the Office of the
      Immigrations Services Commissioner;
   3. Undertaking certain types of claims/compensation related work if not
      registered with the Ministry of Justice.
Paralegals technically have very limited rights to conduct litigation/rights of
audience before courts/tribunals. In practice though many appear in courts and
particularly tribunals at all levels.
Paralegals also act as Police Station Representatives if they are accredited,
giving advice to clients held in police custody.
The National Association of Licensed Paralegals is working to improve
recognition for paralegals and has done so for nearly 24 years, having
introduced qualifications and standards and self-regulation to the profession
and is recognised by The Law Society of England as the professional body for
paralegals in England & Wales.
In Scotland, the Scottish Paralegals Association has been recognised by the Law
Society of Scotland as the independent professional body for paralegals in
Scotland.

The Province of _O_n_t_a_r_i_o, _C_a_n_a_d_a, recently became the first jurisdiction in
North America to provide for the licensing of independent paralegals. This task
will be the responsibility of the _L_a_w_ _S_o_c_i_e_t_y_ _o_f_ _U_p_p_e_r_ _C_a_n_a_d_a (founded in
1797), which already regulates Ontario's 40,000 or so lawyers. Aspiring
paralegals must complete an accredited educational program and complete a
licensing exam. The Society will also be responsible for disciplining
paralegals who do not conform to rules of professional conduct, known as the
Paralegal Rules of Conduct.
The Province of _A_l_b_e_r_t_a, _C_a_n_a_d_a, has no legislation in place currently that
regulates paralegals. The majority of legal assistants and paralegals work
under the supervision of a lawyer.

_A_u_s_t_r_a_l_i_a has a distinct regime for the utiliziation of paralegals._[_3_6_]
According to one _p_a_r_a_l_e_g_a_l_ _s_t_u_d_i_e_s scholar:
     The legal profession‚Äôs monopoly in Australia is, however, confined
     to the right of appearance in a court of law and to the preparation
     of certain documents for reward, which leaves a vast field of legal
     tasks open to performance by other workers, including paralegals.
     ‚ÄîJill Irene Cowley_[_3_6_]
Furthermore, Australian paralegals have "little formal recognition of, or
status accorded" them, yet they "require specialist education."_[_3_6_]

exists, and functions similarly to paralegals. Scriveners perform legal work,
above the level of secretary but below the level of attorney, and may be
attached to an attorney's office or operate independently. Scriveners may
represent clients in some low-level matters, but not in more advanced stages of
litigation. As with lawyers in Japan, scriveners are regulated and must pass an
exam.

Unlike nurses and _p_h_y_s_i_c_i_a_n_ _a_s_s_i_s_t_a_n_t_s, paralegals have not caught the popular
imagination and rarely are seen or mentioned in fictional or non-fiction legal
television programs, or in legal fiction in print. There are however
exceptions.
The most famous is probably _E_r_i_n_ _B_r_o_c_k_o_v_i_c_h, a real legal clerk whose
participation in a _t_o_x_i_c_ _t_o_r_t case became a major motion picture. In the movie
_E_a_g_l_e_ _E_y_e (2008) starring _S_h_i_a_ _L_a_B_e_o_u_f and _M_i_c_h_e_l_l_e_ _M_o_n_a_g_h_a_n, Monaghan plays a
single mom who works as a paralegal._[_3_7_]
Another notable exception is the character _D_e_l_l_a_ _S_t_r_e_e_t, from the _P_e_r_r_y_ _M_a_s_o_n
novel, television and movie series. Although Mason identifies Della as "my
confidential secretary", the projects he assigns her are entirely consistent
with the law office work performed by experienced paralegals.
_J_o_h_n_ _G_r_i_s_h_a_m includes many paralegals in his novels; for example, Rudy Baylor
(the main character in _R_a_i_n_m_a_k_e_r) works briefly as a paralegal - and his
associate Deck subsequently becomes Rudy's paralegal when he starts his own
firm.

paralegal in the form of Avenger, Harvey Birdman's eagle, who is usually seen
managing files, preparing and presenting documents to the attorneys, and
drafting letters to clients. Avenger will usually accompany the charismatic,
yet often underprepared, Birdman into court, and whisper case information and
advice into his ear. Despite not knowing English, he is by far the most
competent employee of Sebben & Sebben.
The most current example is likely contained in _F_X's _T_h_e_ _R_i_c_h_e_s in which Doug
Rich, a con-artist played by _E_d_d_i_e_ _I_z_z_a_r_d, impersonates a lawyer at a cutthroat
real estate development company. Rich's apparent lack of legal knowledge is
often compensated by Aubrey McDonald, a highly-skilled paralegal who manages to
help guide the undereducated anti-hero through more than a few sticky
situations.
In American television, USA's "Suits" features a young paralegal named Rachel
who greatly assists a young aspiring lawyer with various research and
otherwise.
In Eoin Colfer's book, 'The Supernaturalists', paralegals are lawyers that
double as mercenaries to apprehend and then prosecute offenders for the person,
or more common, company who hired them.
A few current and former paralegals have also ventured into politics, including
_A_m_a_n_d_a_ _R_e_e_v_e (Arizona State Legislature) and _M_i_c_h_a_e_l_ _S_t_r_a_u_t_m_a_n_i_s (_O_b_a_m_a friend
