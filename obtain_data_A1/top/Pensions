A ppeennssiioonn is a contract for a fixed sum to be paid regularly to a person,
typically following _r_e_t_i_r_e_m_e_n_t from service._[_1_] Pensions should not be confused
with _s_e_v_e_r_a_n_c_e_ _p_a_y; the former is paid in regular installments, while the
latter is paid in one lump sum.
The terms retirement plan and superannuation refer to a pension granted upon
retirement of the individual._[_2_] Retirement plans may be set up by employers,
insurance companies, the government or other institutions such as employer
associations or trade unions. Called retirement plans in the _U_n_i_t_e_d_ _S_t_a_t_e_s,
they are commonly known as pension schemes in the _U_n_i_t_e_d_ _K_i_n_g_d_o_m and _I_r_e_l_a_n_d
and superannuation plans (or super_[_3_]) in _A_u_s_t_r_a_l_i_a and _N_e_w_ _Z_e_a_l_a_n_d. Retirement
pensions are typically in the form of a guaranteed _l_i_f_e_ _a_n_n_u_i_t_y, thus insuring
against the _r_i_s_k_ _o_f_ _l_o_n_g_e_v_i_t_y.
A pension created by an employer for the benefit of an employee is commonly
referred to as an occupational or employer pension. _L_a_b_o_r_ _u_n_i_o_n_s, the
government, or other organizations may also fund pensions. Occupational
pensions are a form of _d_e_f_e_r_r_e_d_ _c_o_m_p_e_n_s_a_t_i_o_n, usually advantageous to employee
and employer for _t_a_x reasons. Many pensions also contain an additional
_i_n_s_u_r_a_n_c_e aspect, since they often will pay benefits to survivors or disabled
beneficiaries. Other vehicles (certain _l_o_t_t_e_r_y payouts, for example, or an
_a_n_n_u_i_t_y) may provide a similar stream of payments.
The common use of the term pension is to describe the payments a person
receives upon retirement, usually under pre-determined legal or contractual
terms. A recipient of a retirement pension is known as a _p_e_n_s_i_o_n_e_r or retiree.

A retirement plan is an arrangement to provide people with an income during
retirement when they are no longer earning a steady income from employment.
Often retirement plans require both the employer and employee to contribute
money to a fund during their employment in order to receive defined benefits
upon retirement. It is a tax deferred savings vehicle that allows for the tax-
free accumulation of a fund for later use as a retirement income. Funding can
be provided in other ways, such as from labor unions, government agencies, or
self-funded schemes. Pension plans are therefore a form of "deferred
compensation". A _S_S_A_S is a type of employment-based Pension in the UK.
Some countries also grant pensions to military veterans. Military pensions are
overseen by the government; an example of a standing agency is the _U_n_i_t_e_d

Many countries have created funds for their citizens and residents to provide
income when they retire (or in some cases become disabled). Typically this
requires payments throughout the citizen's working life in order to qualify for
benefits later on. A basic state pension is a "contribution based" benefit, and
depends on an individual's contribution history. For examples, see _N_a_t_i_o_n_a_l
_I_n_s_u_r_a_n_c_e in the UK, or _S_o_c_i_a_l_ _S_e_c_u_r_i_t_y in the USA.
Many countries have also put in place a "_s_o_c_i_a_l_ _p_e_n_s_i_o_n". These are regular,
tax-funded non-contributory cash transfers paid to older people. Over 80
countries have social pensions._[_4_] Examples are the "older person's grant" in

Retirement plans may be classified as defined benefit or defined contribution
according to how the benefits are determined._[_7_] A defined benefit plan
guarantees a certain payout at retirement, according to a fixed formula which
usually depends on the member's salary and the number of years' membership in
the plan. A defined contribution plan will provide a payout at retirement that
is dependent upon the amount of money contributed and the performance of the
investment vehicles utilized.
Some types of retirement plans, such as cash balance plans, combine features of
both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. They are often referred to
as hybrid plans. Such plan designs have become increasingly popular in the US
since the 1990s. Examples include Cash Balance and Pension Equity plans.

A traditional defined benefit (DB) plan is a plan in which the benefit on
retirement is determined by a set formula, rather than depending on investment
returns. In the US, _2_6_ _U_._S_._C_. _Â_§_ _4_1_4_(_j_) specifies a defined benefit plan to be
any pension plan that is not a defined contribution plan (see below) where a
defined contribution plan is any plan with individual accounts. A traditional
pension plan that defines a benefit for an employee upon that employee's
retirement is a defined benefit plan.
Traditionally, retirement plans have been administered by institutions which
exist specifically for that purpose, by large businesses, or, for _g_o_v_e_r_n_m_e_n_t
workers, by the government itself. A traditional form of defined benefit plan
is the final salary plan, under which the pension paid is equal to the number
of years worked, multiplied by the member's salary at retirement, multiplied by
a factor known as the accrual rate. The final accrued amount is available as a
monthly pension or a lump sum, but usually monthly.
The benefit in a defined benefit pension plan is determined by a formula that
can incorporate the employee's pay, years of employment, age at retirement, and
other factors. A simple example is a Dollars Times Service plan design that
provides a certain amount per month based on the time an employee works for a
company. For example, a plan offering $100 a month per year of service would
provide $3,000 per month to a retiree with 30 years of service. While this type
of plan is popular among unionized workers, Final Average Pay (FAP) remains the
most common type of defined benefit plan offered in the United States. In FAP
plans, the average salary over the final years of an employee's career
determines the benefit amount.
Averaging salary over a number of years means that the calculation is averaging
different dollars. For example, if salary is averaged over five years, and
retirement is in 2009, then salary in 2004 dollars is averaged with salary in
2005 dollars, etc., with 2004 dollars being worth more than the dollars of
succeeding years. The pension is then paid in first year of retirement dollars,
in this example 2009 dollars, with the lowest value of any dollars in the
calculation. Thus inflation in the salary averaging years has a considerable
impact on purchasing power and cost, both being reduced equally by inflation
This effect of inflation can be eliminated by converting salaries in the
averaging years to first year of retirement dollars, and then averaging.
In the _U_n_i_t_e_d_ _K_i_n_g_d_o_m, benefits are typically indexed for inflation (known as
_R_e_t_a_i_l_ _P_r_i_c_e_s_ _I_n_d_e_x (RPI)) as required by law for registered pension plans._[_8_]
Inflation during an employee's retirement affects the purchasing power of the
pension; the higher the inflation rate, the lower the purchasing power of a
fixed annual pension. This effect can be mitigated by providing annual
increases to the pension at the rate of inflation (usually capped, for instance
at 5% in any given year). This method is advantageous for the employee since it
stabilizes the purchasing power of pensions to some extent.
If the pension plan allows for early retirement, payments are often reduced to
recognize that the _r_e_t_i_r_e_e_s will receive the payouts for longer periods of
time. In the United States, under the _E_m_p_l_o_y_e_e_ _R_e_t_i_r_e_m_e_n_t_ _I_n_c_o_m_e_ _S_e_c_u_r_i_t_y_ _A_c_t
_o_f_ _1_9_7_4, any reduction factor less than or equal to the _a_c_t_u_a_r_i_a_l early
retirement reduction factor is acceptable._[_9_]
Many DB plans include early retirement provisions to encourage employees to
retire early, before the attainment of normal retirement age (usually age 65).
Companies would rather hire younger employees at lower wages. Some of those
provisions come in the form of additional temporary or supplemental benefits,
which are payable to a certain age, usually before attaining normal retirement
age._[_1_0_]

Defined benefit plans may be either funded or unfunded.
In an unfunded defined benefit pension, no assets are set aside and the
benefits are paid for by the employer or other pension sponsor as and when they
are paid. Pension arrangements provided by the state in most countries in the
world are unfunded, with benefits paid directly from current workers'
contributions and taxes. This method of financing is known as Pay-as-you-go
(PAYGO or PAYG)._[_1_1_] The social security systems of many European countries are
unfunded,_[_1_2_] having benefits paid directly out of current taxes and social
security contributions, although several countries have hybrid systems which
are partially funded. Spain set up the Social Security Reserve Fund and France
set up the Pensions Reserve Fund; in Canada the wage-based retirement plan
(CPP) is funded, with assets managed by the _C_P_P_ _I_n_v_e_s_t_m_e_n_t_ _B_o_a_r_d while the U.S.
_S_o_c_i_a_l_ _S_e_c_u_r_i_t_y system is funded by investment in special U.S. Treasury Bonds.
In a funded plan, contributions from the employer, and sometimes also from plan
members, are invested in a fund towards meeting the benefits. The future
returns on the investments, and the future benefits to be paid, are not known
in advance, so there is no guarantee that a given level of contributions will
be enough to meet the benefits. Typically, the contributions to be paid are
regularly reviewed in a valuation of the plan's assets and liabilities, carried
out by an _a_c_t_u_a_r_y to ensure that the pension fund will meet future payment
obligations. This means that in a defined benefit pension, investment risk and
investment rewards are typically assumed by the sponsor/employer and not by the
individual. If a plan is not well-funded, the plan sponsor may not have the

Traditional defined benefit plan designs (because of their typically flat
accrual rate and the decreasing time for interest discounting as people get
closer to retirement age) tend to exhibit a J-shaped accrual pattern of
benefits, where the present value of benefits grows quite slowly early in an
employee's career and accelerates significantly in mid-career: in other words
it costs more to fund the pension for older employees than for younger ones (an
"age bias"). Defined benefit pensions tend to be less _p_o_r_t_a_b_l_e than defined
contribution plans, even if the plan allows a lump sum cash benefit at
termination. Most plans, however, pay their benefits as an annuity, so retirees
do not bear the risk of low investment returns on contributions or of outliving
their retirement income. The open-ended nature of these risks to the employer
is the reason given by many employers for switching from defined benefit to
defined contribution plans over recent years. The risks to the employer can
sometimes be mitigated by discretionary elements in the benefit structure, for
instance in the rate of increase granted on accrued pensions, both before and
after retirement.
The age bias, reduced _p_o_r_t_a_b_i_l_i_t_y and open ended risk make defined benefit
plans better suited to large employers with less mobile workforces, such as the
public sector (which has open-ended support from taxpayers). This coupled with
a lack of foresight on the employers part means a large proportion of the
workforce are kept in the dark over future investment schemes.
Defined benefit plans are sometimes criticized as being paternalistic as they
enable employers or plan trustees to make decisions about the type of benefits
and family structures and lifestyles of their employees. However they are
typically more valuable than defined contribution plans in most circumstances
and for most employees (mainly because the employer tends to pay higher
contributions than under defined contribution plans), so such criticism is
rarely harsh.
The "cost" of a defined benefit plan is not easily calculated, and requires an
actuary or actuarial software. However, even with the best of tools, the cost
of a defined benefit plan will always be an estimate based on economic and
financial assumptions. These assumptions include the average retirement age and
lifespan of the employees, the returns to be earned by the pension plan's
investments and any additional taxes or levies, such as those required by the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation in the U.S. So, for this arrangement, the
benefit is relatively secure but the contribution is uncertain even when
estimated by a professional. This has serious cost considerations and risks for
the employer offering a pension plan._[_1_3_]

Many countries offer state-sponsored retirement benefits, beyond those provided
by employers, which are funded by _p_a_y_r_o_l_l or other taxes. The United States
Social Security system is similar to a defined benefit pension arrangement,
albeit one that is constructed differently than a pension offered by a private
employer.
Individuals that have worked in the UK and have paid certain levels of national
insurance deductions can expect an income from the state pension scheme after
their normal retirement. The state pension is currently divided into two parts:
the basic state pension, State Second [tier] Pension scheme called S2P.
Individuals will qualify for the basic state pension if they have completed
sufficient years contribution to their national insurance record. The S2P
pension scheme is earnings related and depends on earnings in each year as to
how much an individual can expect to receive. It is possible for an individual
to forgo the S2P payment from the state, in lieu of a payment made to an
appropriate pension scheme of their choice, during their working life. For more

In a defined contribution plan, contributions are paid into an individual
account for each member. The contributions are invested, for example in the
stock market, and the returns on the investment (which may be positive or
negative) are credited to the individual's account. On retirement, the member's
account is used to provide retirement benefits, sometimes through the purchase
of an annuity which then provides a regular income. Defined contribution plans
have become widespread all over the world in recent years, and are now the
dominant form of plan in the private sector in many countries. For example, the
number of defined benefit plans in the US has been steadily declining, as more
and more employers see pension contributions as a large expense avoidable by
disbanding the defined benefit plan and instead offering a defined contribution
plan.
Money contributed can either be from employee salary deferral or from employer
contributions. The _p_o_r_t_a_b_i_l_i_t_y of defined contribution pensions is legally no
different from the _p_o_r_t_a_b_i_l_i_t_y of defined benefit plans. However, because of
the cost of administration and ease of determining the plan sponsor's liability
for defined contribution plans (you do not need to pay an actuary to calculate
the lump sum equivalent that you do for defined benefit plans) in practice,
defined contribution plans have become generally _p_o_r_t_a_b_l_e.
In a defined contribution plan, investment risk and investment rewards are
assumed by each individual/employee/retiree and not by the sponsor/employer,
and these risks may be substantial._[_1_4_] In addition, participants do not
necessarily purchase annuities with their savings upon retirement, and bear the
risk of outliving their assets. (In the United Kingdom, for instance, it is a
legal requirement to use the bulk of the fund to purchase an annuity.)
The "cost" of a defined contribution plan is readily calculated, but the
benefit from a defined contribution plan depends upon the account balance at
the time an employee is looking to use the assets. So, for this arrangement,
the contribution is known but the benefit is unknown (until calculated).
Despite the fact that the participant in a defined contribution plan typically
has control over investment decisions, the plan sponsor retains a significant
degree of fiduciary responsibility over investment of plan assets, including
the selection of investment options and administrative providers.
A defined contribution plan typically involves a number of service providers,
including in many cases:
    * Trustee
    * Custodian
    * Administrator
    * Recordkeeper
    * Auditor
    * Legal counsel_[_1_5_]

In the United States, the legal definition of a defined contribution plan is a
plan providing for an individual account for each participant, and for benefits
based solely on the amount contributed to the account, plus or minus income,
gains, expenses and losses allocated to the account (see _2_6_ _U_._S_._C_. _Â_§_ _4_1_4_(_i_)).
Examples of defined contribution plans in the United States include _I_n_d_i_v_i_d_u_a_l
_R_e_t_i_r_e_m_e_n_t_ _A_c_c_o_u_n_t_s (IRAs) and _4_0_1_(_k_)_ _p_l_a_n_s. In such plans, the employee is
responsible, to one degree or another, for selecting the types of _i_n_v_e_s_t_m_e_n_t_s
toward which the funds in the retirement plan are allocated. This may range
from choosing one of a small number of pre-determined _m_u_t_u_a_l_ _f_u_n_d_s to selecting
individual _s_t_o_c_k_s or other _s_e_c_u_r_i_t_i_e_s. Most self-directed retirement plans are
characterized by certain _t_a_x_ _a_d_v_a_n_t_a_g_e_s, and some provide for a portion of the
employee's contributions to be matched by the employer. In exchange, the funds
in such plans may not be withdrawn by the investor prior to reaching a certain
ageâ€”typically the year the employee reaches 59.5 years old-- (with a small
number of exceptions) without incurring a substantial penalty.
In the US, defined contribution plans are subject to _I_R_S limits on how much can
be contributed, known as the section 415 limit. In 2009, the total deferral
amount, including employee contribution plus employer contribution, was limited
to $49,000 or 100% of compensation, whichever is less. The employee-only limit
in 2009 is $16,500 with a $5,500 catch-up. These numbers may increase each year
and are indexed to compensate for the effects of inflation.
Examples of defined contribution pension schemes in other countries are, the
UKâ€™s personal pensions and proposed National Employment Savings Trust (NEST),
Germanyâ€™s Riester plans, Australiaâ€™s Superannuation system and New
Zealandâ€™s KiwiSaver scheme. Individual pension savings plans also exist in
Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Greece, Finland, Ireland, Netherlands,
Slovenia and Spain_[_1_6_]

Hybrid plan designs combine the features of defined benefit and defined
contribution plan designs.
A _c_a_s_h_ _b_a_l_a_n_c_e_ _p_l_a_n is a defined benefit plan made by the employer, with the
help of consulting _a_c_t_u_a_r_i_e_s (like _K_w_a_s_h_a_ _L_i_p_t_o_n, who it is said created the
cash balance plan) to appear as if they were defined contribution plans. They
have notional balances in hypothetical accounts where, typically, each year the
plan administrator will contribute an amount equal to a certain percentage of
each participant's salary; a second contribution, called interest credit, is
made as well. These are not actual contributions and further discussion is
beyond the scope of this entry suffice it to say that there is currently much
controversy. In general, they are usually treated as _d_e_f_i_n_e_d_ _b_e_n_e_f_i_t_ _p_l_a_n_s for
tax, accounting and regulatory purposes. As with defined benefit plans,
investment risk in hybrid designs is largely borne by the plan sponsor. As with
defined contribution designs, plan benefits are expressed in the terms of a
notional account balance, and are usually paid as cash balances upon
termination of employment. These features make them more _p_o_r_t_a_b_l_e than
traditional defined benefit plans and perhaps more attractive to a more highly
mobile workforce.

Advocates of defined contribution plans point out that each employee has the
ability to tailor the investment portfolio to his or her individual needs and
financial situation, including the choice of how much to contribute, if
anything at all. However, others state that these apparent advantages could
also hinder some workers who might not possess the financial savvy to choose
the correct investment vehicles or have the discipline to voluntarily
contribute money to retirement accounts. This debate parallels the discussion
currently going on in the U.S., where many _R_e_p_u_b_l_i_c_a_n leaders favor
transforming the Social Security system, at least in part, to a self-directed
investment plan.

Defined contribution pensions, by definition, are funded, as the "guarantee"
made to employees is that specified (defined) contributions will be made during
an individual's working life.
There are many ways to finance your pension and save for retirement. Pension
plans can be set up by your employer, matching your contribution each month, by
the state or personally through a pension scheme with a financial institution,
such as a bank or brokerage firm. Pension plans often come with a tax break
depending on the country and plan type.
For example Canadians have the option to open a _R_e_g_i_s_t_e_r_e_d_ _R_e_t_i_r_e_m_e_n_t_ _S_a_v_i_n_g_s
_P_l_a_n (RRSP), as well as a range of employee and state pension programs._[_1_7_]
This plan allows contributions to this account to be marked as un-taxable
income and remain un-taxed until withdrawal. Most countryâ€™s governments will
provide advice on pension schemes.

Prussian was 45 years; in fact this figure ignores the very high infant
mortality and high maternal death rate from childbirth of this era. In fact, an
adult entering into insurance under the scheme would on average live to 70
years of age, a figure used in the actuarial assumptions included in the
legislation.

relaxing the stringency of minimum funding requirements for pensions, while

legislated, made to veterans of the _R_e_v_o_l_u_t_i_o_n_a_r_y_ _W_a_r and, more extensively,
the _C_i_v_i_l_ _W_a_r. They were expanded greatly, and began to be offered by a number
of state and local governments during the early _P_r_o_g_r_e_s_s_i_v_e_ _E_r_a in the late
nineteenth century.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]

Pension plans became popular in the United States during _W_o_r_l_d_ _W_a_r_ _I_I, when
wage freezes prohibited outright increases in workers' pay. The defined benefit
plan had been the most popular and common type of _r_e_t_i_r_e_m_e_n_t_ _p_l_a_n_ _i_n_ _t_h_e_ _U_n_i_t_e_d
_S_t_a_t_e_s through the 1980s; since that time, defined contribution plans have
become the more common type of retirement plan in the United States and many
other western countries.
In April 2012, the _N_o_r_t_h_e_r_n_ _M_a_r_i_a_n_a_ _I_s_l_a_n_d_s_ _R_e_t_i_r_e_m_e_n_t_ _F_u_n_d filed for _C_h_a_p_t_e_r

in _a_s_s_e_t_s and $911 million in _l_i_a_b_i_l_i_t_i_e_s. The plan experienced low investment
returns and a benefit structure that had been increased without raises in
funding._[_2_2_] According to Pensions and Investments, this is "apparently the

A growing challenge for many nations is _p_o_p_u_l_a_t_i_o_n_ _a_g_e_i_n_g. As birth rates drop
and life expectancy increases an ever-larger portion of the population is
elderly. This leaves fewer workers for each retired person. In almost all
developed countries this means that government and _p_u_b_l_i_c_ _s_e_c_t_o_r pensions could
collapse their economies unless pension systems are reformed or taxes are
increased[_d_u_b_i_o_u_s â€“ _d_i_s_c_u_s_s]. One method of reforming the pension system is
to increase the retirement age. Two exceptions are _A_u_s_t_r_a_l_i_a and _C_a_n_a_d_a, where
the pension system is forecast to be _s_o_l_v_e_n_t for the foreseeable future.
[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] In Canada, for instance, the annual payments were increased
by some 70% in 1998 to achieve this. These two nations also have an advantage
from their relative openness to immigration. However, their populations are not
growing as fast as the U.S., which supplements a high immigration rate with one
of the highest birthrates among Western countries. Thus, the population in the
U.S. is not ageing to the extent as those in Europe, Australia, or Canada.
Another growing challenge is the recent trend of states and businesses in the
United States purposely under-funding their pension schemes in order to push
the costs onto the federal government. For example, in 2009, the majority of
states have unfunded pension liabilities exceeding all reported state debt.
_B_r_a_d_l_e_y_ _B_e_l_t, former executive director of the PBGC (the _P_e_n_s_i_o_n_ _B_e_n_e_f_i_t
_G_u_a_r_a_n_t_y_ _C_o_r_p_o_r_a_t_i_o_n, the federal agency that insures private-sector defined-
benefit pension plans in the event of bankruptcy), testified before a
Congressional hearing in October 2004, "I am particularly concerned with the
temptation, and indeed, growing tendency, to use the pension insurance fund as
a means to obtain an interest-free and risk-free loan to enable companies to
restructure. Unfortunately, the current calculation appears to be that shifting
pension liabilities onto other premium payers or potentially taxpayers is the
path of least resistance rather than a last resort."
Challenges have further been increased by the post-2007 credit crunch. Total
funding of the nation's 100 largest corporate pension plans fell by $303bn in
2008, going from a $86bn surplus at the end of 2007 to a $217bn deficit at the
end of 2008._[_2_3_]
