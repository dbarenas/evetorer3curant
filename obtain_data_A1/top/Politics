PPoolliittiiccss (from _G_r_e_e_k: politikos, meaning "of, for, or relating to citizens") is
the practice and theory of influencing other people on a civic or individual
level. More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of
_g_o_v_e_r_n_a_n_c_e ‚Äî organized control over a human community, particularly a _s_t_a_t_e.
A variety of methods is employed in politics, which include promoting its own
political views among people, _n_e_g_o_t_i_a_t_i_o_n with other political subjects, making
_l_a_w_s, and exercising _f_o_r_c_e, including _w_a_r_f_a_r_e against adversaries. Politics is
exercised on a wide range of social levels, from _c_l_a_n_s and _t_r_i_b_e_s of
traditional societies, through modern _l_o_c_a_l_ _g_o_v_e_r_n_m_e_n_t_s, _c_o_m_p_a_n_i_e_s and
institutions up to _s_o_v_e_r_e_i_g_n_ _s_t_a_t_e_s, to _i_n_t_e_r_n_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _l_e_v_e_l.
A _p_o_l_i_t_i_c_a_l_ _s_y_s_t_e_m is a framework which defines acceptable political methods
within a given society. _H_i_s_t_o_r_y_ _o_f_ _p_o_l_i_t_i_c_a_l_ _t_h_o_u_g_h_t can be traced back to
early antiquity, with seminal works such as _P_l_a_t_o's _R_e_p_u_b_l_i_c, _A_r_i_s_t_o_t_l_e's
_P_o_l_i_t_i_c_s and opus of _C_o_n_f_u_c_i_u_s.
Modern political discourse focuses on democracy and the relationship between
people and politics. It is thought of as the way we "choose government
officials and make decisions about public policy"._[_1_]

The origin of the _s_t_a_t_e is to be found in the development of the _a_r_t_ _o_f
_w_a_r_f_a_r_e. Historically speaking, all political communities of the modern type
owe their existence to successful warfare._[_7_]
Kings, emperors and other types of monarchs in many countries including China
and Japan, were considered divine. Of the institutions that ruled states, that
of _k_i_n_g_s_h_i_p stood at the forefront until the French Revolution put an end to
the "_d_i_v_i_n_e_ _r_i_g_h_t_ _o_f_ _k_i_n_g_s". Nevertheless, the monarchy is among the longest-
lasting political institutions, dating as early as 2100 BC in Sumeria_[_8_] to the
21st Century AD British Monarchy. Kingship becomes an institution through
heredity.
The king often, even in _a_b_s_o_l_u_t_e_ _m_o_n_a_r_c_h_i_e_s, ruled his kingdom with the aid of
an elite group of advisors, a _C_o_u_n_c_i_l without which he could not maintain
power. As these advisors, and others outside the monarchy negotiated for power,
_c_o_n_s_t_i_t_u_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _m_o_n_a_r_c_h_i_e_s emerged, which may be considered the germ of
_c_o_n_s_t_i_t_u_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _g_o_v_e_r_n_m_e_n_t.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] Long before the council became a
bulwark of democracy, it rendered invaluable aid to the institution of kingship

   3. Being able to withstand criticism as an impersonal authority.
   4. Being able to manage a greater deal of knowledge and action than a single
      individual such as the king.
The greatest of the king's subordinates, the _e_a_r_l_s and _d_u_k_e_s in England and
Scotland, the _d_u_k_e_s and _c_o_u_n_t_s in the Continent, always sat as a right on the
Council. A conqueror wages war upon the vanquished for vengeance or for plunder
but an established kingdom exacts _t_r_i_b_u_t_e. One of the functions of the Council
is to keep the coffers of the king full. Another is the satisfaction of
_m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y_ _s_e_r_v_i_c_e and the establishment of _l_o_r_d_s_h_i_p_s by the king to satisfy the
task of collecting taxes and soldiers._[_9_]

_P_r_o_p_e_r_t_y is the right vested on the individual or a group of people to enjoy
the benefits of an object be it material or intellectual. A right is a power
enforced by public trust. Sometimes it happens that the exercise of a right is
opposed to public trust. Nevertheless, a right is really an institution brought
around by public trust, past, present or future. The growth of knowledge is the
key to the history of property as an institution. The more man becomes
knowledgeable of an object be it physical or intellectual, the more it is
appropriated. The appearance of the State brought about the final stage in the
evolution of property from wildlife to husbandry. In the presence of the State,
man can hold landed property. The State began granting lordships and ended up
conferring property and with it came _i_n_h_e_r_i_t_a_n_c_e. With landed property came
rent and in the exchange of goods, profit, so that in modern times, the "lord
of the land" of long ago becomes the landlord. If it is wrongly assumed that
the value of land is always the same, then there is of course no evolution of
property whatever. However, the price of land goes up with every increase in
population benefiting the landlord. The landlordism of large land owners has
been the most rewarded of all political services. In industry, the position of
the landlord is less important but in towns which have grown out of an
industry, the fortunate landlord has reaped an enormous profit. Towards the
latter part of the Middle Ages in Europe, both the State - the State would use
the instrument of _c_o_n_f_i_s_c_a_t_i_o_n for the first time to satisfy a debt - and the
Church - the Church succeeded in acquiring immense quantities of land - were
allied against the village community to displace the small landlord and they
were successful to the extent that today, the village has become the ideal of
the _i_n_d_i_v_i_d_u_a_l_i_s_t, a place in which every man "does what he wills with his
own." The State has been the most important factor in the evolution of the
institution of property be it public or private._[_1_0_]

As a primarily military institution, the State is concerned with the _a_l_l_e_g_i_a_n_c_e
of its subjects viewing disloyalty and _e_s_p_i_o_n_a_g_e as well as other sorts of
_c_o_n_s_p_i_r_a_c_i_e_s as detrimental to its national security. Thus arises the law of
_t_r_e_a_s_o_n. Criminal acts in general, breaking the peace and treason make up the
whole, or at least part of _c_r_i_m_i_n_a_l_ _l_a_w enforced by the State as distinguished

merchant and ecclesiastical justice due to its strength, skill and simplicity.
One very striking evidence of the superiority of the royal courts over the
feudal and popular courts in the matter of official skill is the fact that,
until comparatively late in history, the royal courts alone kept written
records of their proceedings. The _t_r_i_a_l_ _b_y_ _j_u_r_y was adopted by the Royal
Courts, securing its popularity and making it a bulwark of liberty. By the time

administering justice._[_1_1_]

The making of laws was unknown to primitive societies.
That most persistent of all patriarchal societies, the _J_e_w_i_s_h, retains to a
certain extent its tribal law in the _G_e_n_t_i_l_e cities of the West. This tribal
law is the rudimentary idea of law as it presented itself to people in the
patriarchal stage of society, it was _c_u_s_t_o_m or _o_b_s_e_r_v_a_n_c_e sanctioned by the
approval and practice of ancestors.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]
The state of affairs which existed in the 10th century, when every town had its
own laws and nations like France, Germany, Spain and other countries had no
national law until the end of the 18th century, was brought to an end by three
great agencies that helped to create the modern system of law and legislation:
[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]
   1. RReeccoorrddss:: From the early Middle Ages in Europe there come what are called
      folk-laws and they appear exactly at the time when the patriarchal is
      becoming the State. They are due almost universally to one cause: the
      desire of the king to know the custom of his subjects. These are not
      legislation in the sense of law-making but statements or declarations of
      custom. They are drawn from a knowledge of the custom of the people.
      Unwritten custom changes imperceptibly but not the written. It is always
      possible to point to the exact text and show what it says. Nevertheless,
      the written text can change by addition with every new edition.
   2. LLaaww CCoouurrttss:: By taking some general rule which seemed to be common to all
      the communities and ignoring the differences, English common law was
      modeled after such a practice so that the law became common in all the
      districts of the kingdom. The reason why in the rest of Europe, there was
      no common law till centuries later is because the State in those
      countries did not get hold of the administration of justice when England
      did. One of the shrewdest moves by which the English judges pushed their
      plan of making a common law was by limiting the verdict of the jury in
      every case to _q_u_e_s_t_i_o_n_s_ _o_f_ _f_a_c_t. At first the jury used to give answers
      both on law and fact; and being a purely local body, they followed local
      custom. A famous division came to pass: the province of the judge and the
      province of the jury.
   3. FFiiccttiioonnss:: Records and Law Courts were valuable in helping the people
      adapt to law-making but like Fictions, they were slow and imperfect.
      Though slowly, Fictions work because it is a well known fact that people
      will accept a change in the form of a fiction while they would resist it
      to the end if the fact is out in the open.
Finally there is the enactment of laws or legislation. When progress and
development is rapid, the faster method of _p_o_l_i_t_i_c_a_l_ _r_e_p_r_e_s_e_n_t_a_t_i_o_n is adopted.
This method does not originate in primitive society but in the State need for
money and its use of an assembly to raise the same. From the town assembly, a
national assembly and the progress of commerce sprang _P_a_r_l_i_a_m_e_n_t all over
Europe around the end of the 12th century but not entirely representative or
homogeneous for the nobility and the clergy. The clergy had amassed a fortune
in land, about one-fifth of all Christendom but at the time, in the 12th and
13th centuries, the Church was following a policy of isolation; they adopted
the rule of _c_e_l_i_b_a_c_y and cut themselves from domestic life; they refused to
plead in a secular court; they refused to pay taxes to the State on the grounds
that they had already paid it to the _P_o_p_e. Since the main object of the king in
holding a national assembly was to collect money, the Church could not be left
out and so they came to Parliament. The Church did not like it but in most
cases they had to come.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]
The medieval Parliament was complete when it represented all the states in the
realm: nobles, clergy, peasants and craftsmen but it was not a popular
institution mainly because it meant _t_a_x_a_t_i_o_n. Only by the strongest pressure of
the Crown were Parliaments maintained during the first century of their
existence and the best proof of this assertion lies in the fact that in those
countries where the Crown was weak, Parliament ceased to exist. The notion that
parliaments were the result of a democratic movement cannot be supported by
historical facts. Originally, the representative side of Parliament was solely
concerned with money; representation in Parliament was a liability rather than
a privilege. It is not uncommon that an institution created for one purpose
begins to serve another. People who were asked to contribute with large sums of
money began to _p_e_t_i_t_i_o_n. Pretty soon, sessions in Parliament would turn into
bargaining tables, the king granting petitions in exchange for money. However,
there were two kinds of petitions, one private and the other public and it was
from this last that laws were adopted or _l_e_g_i_s_l_a_t_i_o_n originated. The king as
head of State could give orders to preserve territorial integrity but not until
these royal enactments were combined with public petition that successful
legislation ever took place. Even to the present day, this has always been the
basis of all successful legislation: public custom is adopted and enforced by
the State.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]
In the early days of political representation, the _m_a_j_o_r_i_t_y did not necessarily
carry the day and there was very little need for contested _e_l_e_c_t_i_o_n_s but by the
beginning of the 15th century, a seat in Parliament was something to be
cherished. Historically speaking, the dogma of the equality of man is the
result of the adoption of the purely practical machinery of the majority but
the adoption of the majority principle is also responsible for another
institution of modern times: the _p_a_r_t_y_ _s_y_s_t_e_m. The party system is an elaborate
piece of machinery that pits at least two political candidates against each
other for the vote of an electorate; its advantage being equal representation
interesting a large number of people in politics; it provides effective
criticism of the government in power and it affords an outlet for the ambition
of a large number of wealthy and educated people guaranteeing a consistent
policy in government.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]
These three institutions: political representation, majority rule and the party
system are the basic components of modern political machinery; they are
applicable to both central and local governments and are becoming by their
adaptability ends in themselves rather than a machinery to achieve some
purpose._[_1_2_]

The administration is one of the most difficult aspects of government. In the
enactment and enforcement of laws, the victory of the State is complete but not
so in regards to administration the reason being that it is easy to see the
advantage of the enactment and enforcement of laws but not the administration
of domestic, religious and business affairs which should be kept to a minimum
by government.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]
Originally, the state was a military institution. For many years, it was just a
territory ruled by a king who was surrounded by a small elite group of warriors
and court officials and it was basically rule by force over a larger mass of
people. Slowly, however, the people gained political representation for none
can really be said to be a member of the State without the right of having a
voice in the direction of policy making. One of the basic functions of the
State in regards to administration is maintaining peace and internal order; it
has no other excuse for interfering in the lives of its citizens. To maintain
law and order the State develops means of _c_o_m_m_u_n_i_c_a_t_i_o_n. Historically, the
"king's highway" was laid down and maintained for the convenience of the royal
armies not as an incentive to _c_o_m_m_e_r_c_e. In almost all countries, the State
maintains the control of the means of communication and special freedoms such
as those delineated in the _F_i_r_s_t_ _A_m_e_n_d_m_e_n_t_ _t_o_ _t_h_e_ _U_n_i_t_e_d_ _S_t_a_t_e_s_ _C_o_n_s_t_i_t_u_t_i_o_n
are rather limited. The State's original function of maintaining law and order
within its borders gave rise to _p_o_l_i_c_e administration which is a branch of the
dispensation of _J_u_s_t_i_c_e but on its preventive side, police jurisdiction has a
special character of its own, which distinguishes it from ordinary judicial
work. In the _c_u_r_f_e_w, the State shows early in history the importance of
preventing disorder. In early days, next to maintaining law and order, the
State was concerned with the raising of _r_e_v_e_n_u_e. It was then useful to the
State to establish a _s_t_a_n_d_a_r_d of _w_e_i_g_h_t_s_ _a_n_d_ _m_e_a_s_u_r_e_s so that value could be
generally accepted and finally the State acquired a _m_o_n_o_p_o_l_y of _c_o_i_n_a_g_e. The
regulation of labor by the State as one of its functions dates from the 15th
century, when _t_h_e_ _B_l_a_c_k_ _P_l_a_g_u_e killed around half of the European population.
[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]
The invariable policy of the State has always been to break down all
intermediate authorities and to deal directly with the individual. This was the
policy until _A_d_a_m_ _S_m_i_t_h's _T_h_e_ _W_e_a_l_t_h_ _o_f_ _N_a_t_i_o_n_s was published promoting a
strong public reaction against State interference. By its own action, the State
raised the issue of the poor or the State relief of the _i_n_d_i_g_e_n_t. The State, of
course, did not create poverty but by destroying the chief agencies which dealt
with it such as the village, the church and the _g_u_i_l_d_s, it practically assumed
full responsibility for the poor without exercising any power over it. The
Great Poor Law Report of 1834 showed that _c_o_m_m_u_n_i_s_m was widespread in the rural
areas of England. In newly developed countries such as the _c_o_l_o_n_i_e_s of the
_B_r_i_t_i_s_h_ _E_m_p_i_r_e, the State has refused to take responsibility for the poor and
the relief of poverty, although the poor classes lean heavily towards State
socialism.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]
Taking into account the arguably significant powers of the State, it is only
natural that in times of great crisis such as an overwhelming calamity the
people should invoke general State aid.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]
Political representation has helped to shape State administration. When the
voice of the individual can be heard, the danger of arbitrary interference by
the State is greatly reduced. To that extent is the increase of State activity
popular. There are no hard and fast rules to limit State administration but it
is a fallacy to believe that the State is the nation and what the State does is
necessarily for the good of the nation. In the first place, even in modern
times, the State and the nation are never identical. Even where "universal
suffrage" prevails, the fact remains that an extension of State administration
means an increased interference of some by others, limiting freedom of action.
Even if it is admitted that State and nation are one and the same, it is
sometimes difficult to admit that State administration is necessarily good.
Finally, the modern indiscriminate advocacy of State administration conceals
the fallacy that State officials must necessarily prove more effective in their
action than _p_r_i_v_a_t_e_ _e_n_t_e_r_p_r_i_s_e. Herein lies the basic difference between _P_u_b_l_i_c

second deals basically in _p_r_o_f_i_t but both require a great deal of _e_d_u_c_a_t_i_o_n and
_e_t_h_i_c_a_l_ _c_o_n_d_u_c_t to avoid the mishaps inherent in the relationship not only
relating to _b_u_s_i_n_e_s_s and _l_a_b_o_u_r but also the State and the people
administrating its _g_o_v_e_r_n_m_e_n_t._[_1_3_]

According to Aristotle, States are classified into _m_o_n_a_r_c_h_i_e_s, _a_r_i_s_t_o_c_r_a_c_i_e_s,
_t_i_m_o_c_r_a_c_i_e_s, _d_e_m_o_c_r_a_c_i_e_s, _o_l_i_g_a_r_c_h_i_e_s, and _t_y_r_a_n_n_i_e_s. Due to an increase in
knowledge of the history of politics, this classification has been abandoned.
Generally speaking, no form of government could be considered the absolute
best, as it would have to be the perfect form under all circumstances, for all
people and in all ways. As an institution created by the human nature to _g_o_v_e_r_n
_s_o_c_i_e_t_y, it is vulnerable to _a_b_u_s_e_ _b_y_ _p_e_o_p_l_e_ _f_o_r_ _t_h_e_i_r_ _o_w_n_ _g_a_i_n, no matter what
form of government a state utilizes, thus posing that there is no 'best' form
of government.
All States are varieties of a single type, the sovereign State. All the _G_r_e_a_t
_P_o_w_e_r_s of the modern world rule on the principle of _s_o_v_e_r_e_i_g_n_t_y. Sovereign
power may be vested on an individual as in an _a_u_t_o_c_r_a_t_i_c_ _g_o_v_e_r_n_m_e_n_t or it may
be vested on a group as in a constitutional government. _C_o_n_s_t_i_t_u_t_i_o_n_s are
written documents that specify and limit the powers of the different branches
of government. Although a Constitution is a written document, there is also an
unwritten Constitution. The unwritten constitution is continually being written
by the Legislative branch of government; this is just one of those cases in
which the nature of the circumstances determines the form of government that is
most appropriate. Nevertheless, the written constitution is essential. England
did set the fashion of written constitutions during the _C_i_v_i_l_ _W_a_r but after the
_R_e_s_t_o_r_a_t_i_o_n abandoned them to be taken up later by the _A_m_e_r_i_c_a_n_ _C_o_l_o_n_i_e_s after
their _e_m_a_n_c_i_p_a_t_i_o_n and then _F_r_a_n_c_e after the _R_e_v_o_l_u_t_i_o_n and the rest of Europe
including the European colonies.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]
There are two forms of government, one a strong central government as in France
and the other a local government such as the ancient divisions in England that
is comparatively weaker but less bureaucratic. These two forms helped to shape
the _f_e_d_e_r_a_l_ _g_o_v_e_r_n_m_e_n_t, first in Switzerland, then in the United States in

of the Constitution, the essential features of a federal constitution are: a) A
written supreme constitution in order to prevent disputes between the
jurisdictions of the Federal and State authorities; b) A distribution of power
between the Federal and State governments and c) A Supreme Court vested with
the power to interpret the Constitution and enforce the law of the land
remaining independent of both the executive and legislative branches._[_1_4_]

Recently in history, political analysts and politicians divide politics into
_l_e_f_t_ _w_i_n_g and _r_i_g_h_t_ _w_i_n_g politics, often also using the idea of center politics
as a middle path of policy between the right and left. This classification is
comparatively recent (it was not used by _A_r_i_s_t_o_t_l_e or _H_o_b_b_e_s, for instance),
and dates from the _F_r_e_n_c_h_ _R_e_v_o_l_u_t_i_o_n era, when those members of the _N_a_t_i_o_n_a_l

action for a _p_r_o_l_e_t_a_r_i_a_n revolution to overthrow the _b_o_u_r_g_e_o_i_s society and
abolish private property, in the belief that this would lead to a _c_l_a_s_s_l_e_s_s and

The meaning of left-wing and right-wing varies considerably between different
countries and at different times, but generally speaking, it can be said that
the right wing often values _t_r_a_d_i_t_i_o_n and _s_o_c_i_a_l_ _s_t_r_a_t_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n while the left

between the two such as with _s_o_c_i_a_l_ _d_e_m_o_c_r_a_c_y or _r_e_g_u_l_a_t_e_d_ _c_a_p_i_t_a_l_i_s_m._[_2_2_]
According to _N_o_r_b_e_r_t_o_ _B_o_b_b_i_o, one of the major exponents of this distinction,
the Left believes in attempting to eradicate social inequality, while the Right
regards most social inequality as the result of ineradicable natural
inequalities, and sees attempts to enforce social equality as utopian or
authoritarian._[_2_3_]
Some ideologies, notably _C_h_r_i_s_t_i_a_n_ _D_e_m_o_c_r_a_c_y, claim to combine left and right
