banks to private individuals who invest sizable assets. The term "private"
refers to customer service rendered on a more personal basis than in mass-
market _r_e_t_a_i_l_ _b_a_n_k_i_n_g, usually via dedicated bank advisers. It does not refer

Private banking forms an important, more exclusive, subset of wealth
management. At least until recently, it largely consisted of banking services
(deposit taking and payments), discretionary asset management, brokerage,
limited tax advisory services and some basic concierge-type services, offered
by a single designated relationship manager. On the whole, many clients trust
their private banking relationship manager to ‚Äòget on with it‚Äô, and take a
largely passive approach to financial decision making.

Private banking is the way banking originated. _T_h_e_ _f_i_r_s_t_ _b_a_n_k_s_ _i_n_ _V_e_n_i_c_e were
focused on managing personal finance for wealthy families. Private banks became
known as ‚ÄòPrivate‚Äô to stand out from the retail banking & _s_a_v_i_n_g_s_ _b_a_n_k_s
aimed at the new middle class. Traditionally, Private Banks were linked to
families for several generations. They often advised and performed all
financial & banking services for families. Historically, private banking has
developed in Europe (see the _L_i_s_t_ _o_f_ _p_r_i_v_a_t_e_ _b_a_n_k_s). Some banks in Europe are
known for managing assets of some royal families. The assets of the _P_r_i_n_c_e_l_y
_F_a_m_i_l_y_ _o_f_ _L_i_e_c_h_t_e_n_s_t_e_i_n is managed by _L_G_T_ _B_a_n_k (founded in 1920). The assets of
the _D_u_t_c_h_ _r_o_y_a_l_ _f_a_m_i_l_y is managed by _M_e_e_s_P_i_e_r_s_o_n (founded in 1720). The assets
of the _B_r_i_t_i_s_h_ _R_o_y_a_l_ _F_a_m_i_l_y is managed by _C_o_u_t_t_s (founded in 1692). _[_1_]
Historically, private banking has been viewed as a very exclusive niche that
only caters to _H_i_g_h_-_n_e_t_-_w_o_r_t_h_ _i_n_d_i_v_i_d_u_a_l_s (HNWIs) with liquidity over $2
million, though it is now possible to open private banking accounts with as
little as $250,000 for private investors. An institution's private banking
division provides services such as wealth management, savings, inheritance, and
tax planning for their clients. A high-level form of private banking (for the
especially affluent) is often referred to as _w_e_a_l_t_h_ _m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t. For private
banking services clients pay either based on the number of transactions, the
annual portfolio performance or a "flat-fee", usually calculated as a yearly
percentage of the total investment amount._[_2_]
"Private" also alludes to _b_a_n_k_ _s_e_c_r_e_c_y and minimizing taxes through careful
allocation of assets, or by hiding assets from the taxing authorities. _S_w_i_s_s
and certain _o_f_f_s_h_o_r_e_ _b_a_n_k_s have been criticized for such cooperation with
individuals practicing tax evasion. Although _t_a_x_ _f_r_a_u_d is a criminal offense in
Switzerland, tax evasion is only a _c_i_v_i_l_ _o_f_f_e_n_c_e, not requiring banks to notify
taxing authorities._[_3_]
In Switzerland, there are many banks providing private banking service._[_4_] From
_C_o_n_g_r_e_s_s_ _o_f_ _V_i_e_n_n_a in 1815 Switzerland has remained neutral including the time
of two World Wars. After World War I, the former nobles of _A_u_s_t_r_o_-_H_u_n_g_a_r_i_a_n
_E_m_p_i_r_e moved their assets to Switzerland for fear of confiscation by new
governments._[_5_] During World War II, many wealthy people, including Jewish
families and institutions, moved their assets into Switzerland to protect them
from Nazi Germany. However, this transfer of wealth into Switzerland had mixed
and controversial results, as beneficiaries had difficulties retrieving their
assets after the war._[_6_] After World War II, in east Europe, assets were again
moved into Switzerland for fear of confiscation by communistic governments.
Today, Switzerland remains the largest offshore center, with about 27 percent
($2.0 trillion) of global offshore wealth in 2009, according to _B_o_s_t_o_n
_C_o_n_s_u_l_t_i_n_g_ _G_r_o_u_p._[_7_] (Offshore wealth is defined as assets booked in a country
where the investor has no legal residence or tax domicile)
In England private banks were established in 17th century, in parallel with the
development of agriculture, managing the assets of the royal family, nobility
and the landed gentry.
The United States has one of the largest scale private banking systems in part
due to the 3.1 million HNWIs accounting for 28.6% of the global HNWIs
population in 2010, according to the co-research of _C_a_p_g_e_m_i_n_i and _M_e_r_r_i_l_l
_L_y_n_c_h. Some American banks that specialize in private banking date back to 19th
century, such as _U_._S_._ _T_r_u_s_t (founded in 1812) and Northern Trust (founded in
1889).
Recent developments in Private Banking The internationalization of the economy,
technological developments such as the Internet and mobile ensure that banks
have to innovate their _v_a_l_u_e_ _p_r_o_p_o_s_i_t_i_o_n and look for new _m_a_r_k_e_t_s. For example,
the growth of _H_i_g_h_ _N_e_t_ _W_o_r_t_h_ _I_n_d_i_v_i_d_u_a_l_s (HNWI) is low in Traditional Private
Banking markets like Europe compared to _A_s_i_a_ _w_h_e_r_e_ _t_h_e_ _n_u_m_b_e_r_ _o_f_ _m_i_l_l_i_o_n_a_i_r_e_s

banks can offer banking services without an extensive network of offices
without extensive. The regulation of reward and regaining confidence after the
banking crisis require a new level of transparency and different methods of
charging for services.

Most Private Banks define their value proposition along one or two dimensions,
and meet the basic needs across others. Some of the dimensions of value
proposition of a private bank are parent brand, one-bank approach, unbiased
advice, strong research and advisory team and unified platform. Many banks
leverage the ‚Äúppaarreenntt bbrraanndd‚Äù to gain a client‚Äôs trust and confidence.
These Banks have a strong presence across the globe and present private bank
offerings as a part of the parent group. ‚ÄúOOnnee BBaannkk aapppprrooaacchh‚Äù is where
private banks offer an integrated proposition to meet clients personal and
business needs. Since Private Banking concerns understanding a client‚Äôs need
and risk appetite, and tailoring the solution accordingly, few banks define
their value proposition along this dimension. Most modern private banks follow
an open product platform, and hence claim their advice is unbiased. They
believe there is no incentive to push proprietary products, and the client gets
the best of what they offer. A few banks claim to have a ‚Äússttrroonngg aaddvviissoorryy
tteeaamm‚Äù that reflects in the products they offer the client. A couple of banks
also define their value proposition on their unified platform, their ability to
comply with all regulations, yet serve the client without restrictions.

Open architecture product platform is where a private bank distributes all the
third party products and is not restricted to selling only its proprietary
products. Closed architecture product platform is where the bank sells only its
propriety products and does not entertain any third party product. These days
the needs of the clients are so diverse that it is practically impossible for a
bank to cater to those needs by its proprietary products alone. Clients today
demand the best of breed products and most banks have to follow an open
architecture product platform where they distribute products of other banks to
their clients in return for commission.

Different Banks charge their clients in different ways. There are banks that
follow the transactional model where the client is not charged any advisory fee
at all. The banks thrive totally on the commissions they get by distributing
third party products. There are other private banks that follow a hybrid model.
In this model, the bank charges a fixed fee for certain products and advisory
fee for the rest. Some of the other banks are totally advisory driven and
charge the clients a percentage of AUM (e.g. 0.75% of entire AUM). A few banks
offer both a transactional model and an advisory model. The clients choose what
suits them. A recent industry trend is towards the advisory fee model, because
margins on commissions may go down in the future.

Lead Generation is a vital part in the Private banking business. Various banks
go about in different ways to acquire new clients. While some banks rely
heavily on their wholesale banking referrals there are a few other that have
strong tie ups with their Retail and Corporate banking divisions. Most banks do
have a revenue sharing mechanism in place within divisions. It is either a
onetime charge to the division or an annuity that the division gets for a
client referral. Many Banks believe that the primary source of leads must be
client referrals. A client would refer to his / her friends when he / she is
