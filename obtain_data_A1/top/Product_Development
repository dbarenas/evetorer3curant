In _b_u_s_i_n_e_s_s and _e_n_g_i_n_e_e_r_i_n_g, nneeww pprroodduucctt ddeevveellooppmmeenntt (NPD) is the complete
process of bringing a new _p_r_o_d_u_c_t to market. A product is a set of benefits
offered for exchange and can be tangible (that is, something physical you can
touch) or intangible (like a service, experience, or belief). There are two
parallel paths involved in the NPD process: one involves the idea generation,
_p_r_o_d_u_c_t_ _d_e_s_i_g_n and detail engineering; the other involves market research and
_m_a_r_k_e_t_i_n_g_ _a_n_a_l_y_s_i_s. Companies typically see new product development as the
_f_i_r_s_t_ _s_t_a_g_e in generating and commercializing new product within the overall
strategic process of _p_r_o_d_u_c_t_ _l_i_f_e_ _c_y_c_l_e_ _m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t used to maintain or grow

          o Ideas for new products can be obtained from basic research using a
            _S_W_O_T_ _a_n_a_l_y_s_i_s (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities & Threats).
            Market and consumer trends, company's _R_&_D department, competitors,
            focus groups, employees, salespeople, corporate spies, trade shows,
            or ethnographic discovery methods (searching for user patterns and
            habits) may also be used to get an insight into new product lines
            or product features.
          o Lots of ideas are generated about the new product. Out of these
            ideas many are implemented. The ideas are generated in many forms.
            Many reasons are responsible for generation of an idea.

          o Product Costs (fixed & variable)
          o Forecast of unit volumes, revenue, and profit
These steps may be iterated as needed. Some steps may be eliminated. To reduce
the time that the NPD process takes, many companies are completing several
steps at the same time (referred to as _cc_oo_nn_cc_uu_rr_rr_ee_nn_tt_ _ee_nn_gg_ii_nn_ee_ee_rr_ii_nn_gg or _tt_ii_mm_ee_ _tt_oo
_mm_aa_rr_kk_ee_tt). Most industry leaders see new product development as a proactive
process where resources are allocated to identify market changes and seize upon
new product opportunities before they occur (in contrast to a reactive strategy
in which nothing is done until problems occur or the competitor introduces an
innovation). Many industry leaders see new product development as an ongoing
process (referred to as continuous development) in which the entire
organization is always looking for opportunities.
For the more innovative products indicated on the diagram above, great amounts
of uncertainty and change may exist which makes it difficult or impossible to
plan the complete project before starting it. In this case, a more _f_l_e_x_i_b_l_e
_a_p_p_r_o_a_c_h may be advisable.
Because the NPD process typically requires both engineering and marketing
expertise, _c_r_o_s_s_-_f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _t_e_a_m_s are a common way of organizing projects. The
team is responsible for all aspects of the project, from initial idea
generation to final commercialization, and they usually report to senior
management (often to a vice president or Program Manager). In those industries
where products are technically complex, development research is typically
expensive and product life cycles are relatively short, strategic alliances
among several organizations helps to spread the costs, provide access to a
wider skill set and speeds up the overall process.
Also, notice that because both engineering and marketing expertise are usually
critical to the process, choosing an appropriate blend of the two is important.
Observe (for example, by looking at the SSeeee aallssoo or RReeffeerreenncceess sections below)
that this article is slanted more toward the marketing side. For more of an
engineering slant, see the Ulrich and Eppinger, Ullman references below._[_2_]_[_3_]
People respond to new products in different ways. The adoption of a new
technology can be analyzed using a variety of _d_i_f_f_u_s_i_o_n_ _t_h_e_o_r_i_e_s such as the
_D_i_f_f_u_s_i_o_n_ _o_f_ _I_n_n_o_v_a_t_i_o_n_s theory.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]
A new product pricing process is important to reduce risk and increase
confidence in the pricing and marketing decisions to be made. Bernstein and
Macias describe an integrated process that breaks down the complex task of new
product pricing into manageable elements._[_4_]

The Fuzzy Front End is the messy "getting ended" period of new product
engineering development processes. It is in the front end where the
organization formulates a concept of the product to be developed and decides
whether or not to invest resources in the further development of an idea. It is
the phase between first consideration of an opportunity and when it is judged
ready to enter the structured development process (Kim and Wilemon, 2007;_[_6_]
Koen et al., 2001)._[_1_] It includes all activities from the search for new
opportunities through the formation of a germ of an idea to the development of
a precise concept. The Fuzzy Front End ends when an organization approves and
begins formal development of the concept.
Although the Fuzzy Front End may not be an expensive part of product
development, it can consume 50% of development time (see Chapter 3 of the Smith
and Reinertsen reference below),_[_7_] and it is where major commitments are
typically made involving time, money, and the product‚Äôs nature, thus setting
the course for the entire project and final end product. Consequently, this
phase should be considered as an essential part of development rather than
something that happens ‚Äúbefore development,‚Äù and its cycle time should be
included in the total development cycle time.
Koen et al. (2001, pp. 47‚Äì51)_[_1_] distinguish five different front-end
elements (not necessarily in a particular order):
   1. Opportunity Identification
   2. Opportunity Analysis
   3. Idea Genesis
   4. Idea Selection
   5. Concept and Technology Development
The first element is the opportunity identification. In this element, large or
incremental business and technological chances are identified in a more or less
structured way. Using the guidelines established here, resources will
eventually be allocated to new projects.... which then lead to a structured
NPPD (New Product & Process Development) strategy.
The second element is the opportunity analysis. It is done to translate the
identified opportunities into implications for the business and technology
specific context of the company. Here extensive efforts may be made to align
ideas to target customer groups and do market studies and/or technical trials
and research.
The third element is the idea genesis, which is described as evolutionary and
iterative process progressing from birth to maturation of the opportunity into
a tangible idea. The process of the idea genesis can be made internally or come
from outside inputs, e.g. a supplier offering a new material/technology or from
a customer with an unusual request.
The fourth element is the idea selection. Its purpose is to choose whether to
pursue an idea by analyzing its potential business value.
The fifth element is the concept and technology development. During this part
of the front-end, the business case is developed based on estimates of the
total available market, customer needs, investment requirements, competition
analysis and project uncertainty. Some organizations consider this to be the
first stage of the NPPD process (i.e., Stage 0).
The Fuzzy Front End is also described in literature as "Front End of
Innovation", "Phase 0", "Stage 0" or "Pre-Project-Activities".
A universally acceptable definition for Fuzzy Front End or a dominant framework
has not been developed so far._[_8_] In a glossary of PDMA,_[_9_] it is mentioned
that the Fuzzy Front End generally consists of three tasks: strategic planning,
concept generation, and, especially, pre-technical evaluation. These activities
are often chaotic, unpredictable, and unstructured. In comparison, the
subsequent new product development process is typically structured,
predictable, and formal. The term Fuzzy Front End was first popularized by
Smith and Reinertsen (1991)._[_1_0_] R.G.Cooper (1988)_[_1_1_] describes the early
stages of NPPD as a four step process in which ideas are generated (I),
subjected to a preliminary technical and market assessment (II) and merged to
coherent product concepts (III) which are finally judged for their fit with
existing product strategies and portfolios (IV). In a more recent paper, Cooper
and Edgett (2008)_[_1_2_] affirm that vital predevelopment activities include:
   1. Preliminary market assessment
   2. Technical assessment
   3. Source-of-supply-assessment: suppliers and partners or alliances
   4. Market research: market size and segmentation analysis, VoC (_v_o_i_c_e_ _o_f_ _t_h_e
      _c_u_s_t_o_m_e_r) research
   5. Product concept testing
   6. Value-to-the customer assessment
   7. Product definition
   8. Business and financial analysis
These activities yield vital information to make a Go/No-Go to Development
decision.
In one of the most earliest studies using the case study method, Khurana and
Rosenthal_[_1_3_] defined the front-end to include the interrelated activities of:
    * product strategy formulation and communication
    * opportunity identification and assessment
    * idea generation
    * product definition
    * project planning
    * executive reviews
Economical analysis, benchmarking of competitive products and modeling and
prototyping are also important activities during the front-end activities.
The outcomes of FFE are the
    * mission statement
    * customer needs
    * details of the selected concept
    * product definition and specifications
    * economic analysis of the product
    * the development schedule
    * project staffing and the budget
    * a business plan aligned with corporate strategy
In a paper by Husig, Kohn and Huskela (2005)_[_1_4_] a conceptual model of Front-
End Process was proposed which includes early Phases of Innovation Process.
This model is structured in three phases and three gates:
    * Phase 1: Environmental screening or opportunity identification stage in
      which external changes will be analysed and translated into potential
      business opportunities.
    * Phase 2: Preliminary definition of an idea or concept.
    * Phase 3: Detailed product, project or concept definition, and Business
      planning.
The gates are:
    * Opportunity screening
    * Idea evaluation
    * Go/No-Go for development
The final gate leads to a dedicated new product development project. Many
professionals and academics consider that the general features of Fuzzy Front
End (fuzziness, ambiguity, and uncertainty) make it difficult to see the FFE as
a structured process,but rather as a set of interdependent activities ( e.g.
Kim and Wilemon, 2002)._[_1_5_] However, Husig et al., 2005 [10] argue that front-
end not need to be fuzzy, but can be handled in a structured manner. In fact
Carbone _[_1_6_] showed that when using the front end success factors in an
integrated process, product success is increased. Peter Koen_[_1_7_] argues that in
the FFE for incremental, platform and radical projects, three separate
strategies and processes are typically involved._[_1_7_] The traditional Stage Gate
(TM) process was designed for incremental product development, namely for a
single product. The FFE for developing a new platform must start out with a
strategic vision of where the company wants to develop products and this will
lead to a family of products. Projects for breakthrough products start out with
a similar strategic vision, but are associated with technologies which require
new discoveries.
It is worth mentioning what incremental, platform and breakthrough products
are.
    * Incremental products are considered to be cost reductions, improvements
      to existing product lines, additions to existing platforms and
      repositioning of existing products introduced in markets.
    * Breakthrough products are new to the company or new to the world and
