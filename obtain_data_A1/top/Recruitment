RReeccrruuiittmmeenntt refers to the process of attracting, screening, selecting, and
onboarding a qualified person for a _j_o_b. At the strategic level it may involve
the development of an _e_m_p_l_o_y_e_r_ _b_r_a_n_d which includes an 'employee offering'.
The stages of the recruitment process include: job analysis and developing a
person specification; the sourcing of candidates by _n_e_t_w_o_r_k_i_n_g, _a_d_v_e_r_t_i_s_i_n_g, or
other search methods; matching candidates to job requirements and screening
individuals using testing (skills or personality assessment); assessment of
candidates' motivations and their fit with organisational requirements by
interviewing and other assessment techniques. The recruitment process also
includes the making and finalising of job offers and the induction and
_o_n_b_o_a_r_d_i_n_g of new employees._[_1_]
Depending on the size and culture of the organisation recruitment may be
undertaken in-house by managers, human resource generalists and / or
recruitment specialists. Alternatively parts of all of the process might be
undertaken by either public sector employment agencies, or commercial
recruitment agencies, or specialist search consultancies.

In situations such as where one or more new jobs are to be created and
recruited to for the first time, a _j_o_b_ _a_n_a_l_y_s_i_s and/or in some cases a _t_a_s_k
_a_n_a_l_y_s_i_s might be undertaken to document the actual or intended requirements of
the job. From these the relevant information is captured in such documents as
_j_o_b_ _d_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n_s and job specifications. Often a company will already have job
descriptions that represent a historical collection of tasks performed. Where
already drawn up, these documents need to be reviewed or updated to reflect
present day requirements. Prior to initiating the recruitment stages a _p_e_r_s_o_n
_s_p_e_c_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n should be finalised to provide the recruiters commissioned with

_S_o_u_r_c_i_n_g is the use of one or more strategies to attract or identify candidates
to fill job vacancies. It may involve internal and/or external _a_d_v_e_r_t_i_s_i_n_g,
using appropriate media, such as local or national newspapers, specialist
recruitment media, professional publications, window advertisements, job
centres, or in a variety of ways via the internet. Alternatively, employers may
use recruitment consultancies or _a_g_e_n_c_i_e_s to find otherwise scarce candidates
who may be content in their current positions and are not actively looking to
move companies may be proactively identified. This initial research for so-
called passive candidates, also called name generation, results in a contact
information of potential candidates who can then be contacted discreetly to be
screened and approached._[_1_]

Suitability for a _j_o_b is typically assessed by looking for relevant _s_k_i_l_l_s,
_k_n_o_w_l_e_d_g_e, _a_p_t_i_t_u_d_e, _q_u_a_l_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n_s and educational or job related experience.
These can be determined via: _s_c_r_e_e_n_i_n_g _r_Ã_©_s_u_m_Ã_©_s (also known as CVs); _j_o_b

performance assessments, _p_s_y_c_h_o_l_o_g_i_c_a_l, _a_p_t_i_t_u_d_e, _n_u_m_e_r_a_c_y, _p_h_y_s_i_c_a_l and
_l_i_t_e_r_a_c_y testing. Many recruiters and agencies use _a_p_p_l_i_c_a_n_t_ _t_r_a_c_k_i_n_g_ _s_y_s_t_e_m_s
to perform the filtering process, along with software tools for _p_s_y_c_h_o_m_e_t_r_i_c
_t_e_s_t_i_n_g and performance based assessment. _[_2_] Performance based assessment is a
process to find out if job applicants perform the responsibilities for which
they are applying. _[_3_] In many countries, employers are legally mandated to
ensure their screening and selection processes meet _e_q_u_a_l_ _o_p_p_o_r_t_u_n_i_t_y and
ethical standards._[_1_]
In addition to the above selection assessment criteria, employers are likely to
recognise the value of candidates who also have the so-called 'soft skills',
such as interpersonal or team leadership and have the ability to reinforce the
company brand through their behaviour in front of customers and suppliers.
Multinational organisations and those that recruit from a range of
nationalities are also concerned candidates will fit into the prevailing
company 'culture'._[_4_]

"Lateral hiring" refers to a form of recruiting; the term is used with two
different, almost opposite meanings. In one meaning, the hiring organization
targets employees of another, similar organization, possibly luring them with a
better salary and the promise of better career opportunities. An example is the
recruiting of a partner of a _l_a_w_ _f_i_r_m by another law firm. The new lateral hire
then has specific applicable expertise and can make a running start in the new
job. In some professional branches such lateral hiring was traditionally
frowned upon, but the practice has become increasingly more common. An
employee's contract may have a _n_o_n_-_c_o_m_p_e_t_e_ _c_l_a_u_s_e preventing such lateral
hiring.
In another meaning, a lateral hire is a newly hired employee who has no prior
specific applicable expertise for the new job, and for whom this job move is a
radical change of career. An example is the recruiting of a _u_n_i_v_e_r_s_i_t_y
_p_r_o_f_e_s_s_o_r to become _c_h_a_i_r_m_a_n of the _b_o_a_r_d_ _o_f_ _a_ _c_o_m_p_a_n_y.

"_O_n_b_o_a_r_d_i_n_g" is a term which describes the process of helping new employees
become productive members of an organization. A well-planned introduction helps
new employees become fully operational quickly and is often integrated with a
new company and environment. On-boarding is included in the recruitment process
for retention purposes. Many companies have onboarding campaigns in hopes to
retain top talent that is new to the company; campaigns may last anywhere from
1 week to 6 months.

There are a variety of recruitment approaches and most organisations will
utilize a combination of two or more of these as part of a recruitment exercise
or to deliver their overall recruitment strategy. In summary five basic models
more commonly found are:-
    * An in-house personnel or human resources function may in some case still
      conduct all stages of the recruitment process. In the smallest
      organisations recruitment may be left to individual managers. More
      frequently whilst managing the overall recruitment exercise and the
      decision-making at the final stages of the selection process external
      service providers may undertake the more specialized aspects of the
      recruitment process.
    * Outsourcing of recruitment to an external provider may be the solution
      for some small businesses and at the other extreme very large
      organisations
    * _E_m_p_l_o_y_m_e_n_t_ _a_g_e_n_c_i_e_s are established as both publicly funded services and
      as commercial private sector operations. Services may support permanent,
      temporary, or casual worker recruitment. They may be generic agencies
      that deal with providing unskilled workers through to highly skilled
      managerial or technical staff or so-called niche agencies that specialize
      in a particular industrial sector or professional group.
    * _E_x_e_c_u_t_i_v_e_ _s_e_a_r_c_h firms for executive and professional positions. These
      firms operate across a range of models such as contingency or retained
      approaches and also hybrid models where advertising is also used to
      ensure a flow of candidates alongside relying on networking as their main
      source of candidates.
    * Internet recruitment services including recruitment websites and job
      search engines used to gather as many candidates as possible by
      advertising a position over a wide geographic area. In addition social
      network sourced recruitment has emerged as a major method of sourcing
      candidates.

Many _e_m_p_l_o_y_e_r_s undertake at least some if not most of their own in-house
recruitment, using their _h_u_m_a_n_ _r_e_s_o_u_r_c_e_s department, front-line hiring managers
and recruitment personnel who handle targeted functions and populations. In
addition to coordinating with the agencies mentioned above, in-house recruiters
may advertise job vacancies on their own websites and other job boards,
coordinate internal employee referrals, target and headhunt external candidates
(much like an external agency or search firm), work with external associations,
trade groups and/or focus on campus _g_r_a_d_u_a_t_e_ _r_e_c_r_u_i_t_m_e_n_t. Some large employers
choose to outsource all or some of their recruitment process (_r_e_c_r_u_i_t_m_e_n_t
_p_r_o_c_e_s_s_ _o_u_t_s_o_u_r_c_i_n_g) however a much more common approach is for employers to
introduce referral schemes where employees are encouraged to source new staff
from within their own network.

move around between multiple companies, working at each one for a short stint
as needed for specific hiring purposes. The responsibility is to filter
candidates as per the requirements of each client.

An employee referral program is a system where existing employees recommend
prospective candidates for the job offered, and if the suggested candidate is
hired, the employee who referred receives a cash bonus._[_5_]
In some cases the organization provides the employee referral bonus only if the
referred employee stays with the organization for stipulated time duration
(most cases 3 â€“ 6 months). Referral bonus depends on the grade of the
referred employee, higher the grade higher the bonus however the method is not
used for senior level hiring.

An external recruitment provider may suit small organisations without the
facilities to recruit. In typically the largest organisations a formal contract
for services has been negotiated with a specialist recruitment consultancy.

Job interview 0001
College recruiting may not be living up to its potential:
    * Companies may not be realizing full value from their recruitment
      programs.
    * Fewer than half of _c_o_r_p_o_r_a_t_e recruiters receive trainning in the proper
      techniques for _i_n_t_e_r_v_i_e_w_i_n_g job applicants.
Recruiters tend to form a positive or negative impression about an applicant's
_q_u_a_l_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n_s in the first few minutes of an interview, hardly sufficient time
to collect information on which to base a recruiting decision. Recruiters also
tend to spend more time talking with applicants they consider to be qualified
and less time with applicants they dismiss on the basis of a superficial
judgement. Often, recruiters do not follow the corporate script about:
   1. The topics to be covered in an interview
   2. Sometimes they fail to discuss important issues with applicants.
All these points reflect a lack of interviewing skills.

Employment agencies operate in both the public and private sectors. Publicly
funded services have a long history, often having been introduced to mitigate
the impact on unemployment of economic downturns, such as those which form part
of the _N_e_w_ _D_e_a_l program in the US, and the _J_o_b_ _C_e_n_t_r_e_ _P_l_u_s service in the UK.
The commercial recruitment industry is based on the goal of providing a
candidate to a client for a price. At one end of the spectrum there are
agencies that are paid only if they deliver a candidate that successfully stays
with the client beyond the agreed probationary period. On the other end of the
spectrum there are agencies that are paid a retainer to focus on a client's
needs and achieve milestones in the search for the right candidate, and then
again are paid a percentage of the candidate's salary when a candidate is
placed and stays with the organization beyond the probationary period.
The agency recruitment industry is highly competitive, therefore agencies have
sought out ways to differentiate themselves and add value by focusing on some
area of the recruitment life cycle. Though most agencies provide a broader
range of service offering, at the two extremes are the traditional providers
and the niche operators.

Also known as _e_m_p_l_o_y_m_e_n_t_ _a_g_e_n_c_i_e_s, recruitment agencies have historically had a
physical location. A candidate visits a local branch for a short interview and
an assessment before being taken onto the agencyâ€™s books. Recruitment
consultants then work to match their pool of candidates to their clients' open
positions. Suitable candidates are short-listed and put forward for an
interview with potential employers on a contract or direct basis.

'Specialized recruiters' exist to seek staff with a very narrow specialty.
Because of their focus, these firms can very often produce superior results due
to their ability to channel all of their resources into networking for a very
specific skill set. This specialization in staffing allows them to offer more
jobs for their specific demographic which in turn attracts more specialized
candidates from that specific demographic over time building large proprietary
databases. These niche firms tend to be more focused on building ongoing
relationships with their candidates as is very common the same candidates are
placed many times throughout their careers. Online resources have developed to
help find niche recruiters._[_6_] Niche firms also develop knowledge on specific
employment trends within their industry of focus (e.g. the energy industry) and
are able to identify demographic shifts such as aging and its impact on the
industry._[_7_]
Financial arrangements operated by agencies take several forms, the most
popular are:
    * A contingency fee paid by the company when an agency introduced candidate
      accepts a job with the client company. Typical fees range from 15% to 25%
      based on the candidates first-year base salary (fees as low as 12.5% can
      be found online). This type of recruitment usually has a rebate guarantee
      should the candidate fail to perform or leave within a set period of time
      (often up to a 3-month period and as much as a 100% rebate).
    * An _a_d_v_a_n_c_e_ _p_a_y_m_e_n_t that serves as a _r_e_t_a_i_n_e_r, also paid by the company,
      non-refundable paid in full depending on outcome and success (e.g. 40% up
      front, 30% in 90 days and the remainder once a search is completed). This
      form of compensation is generally reserved for high level executive
      search/headhunters
    * Hourly charge for temporary workers and projects. A pre-negotiated hourly
      fee, in which the agency is paid and pays the applicant as a consultant
      for services as a third party. Many contracts allow a consultant to
      transition to a full-time status upon completion of a certain number of
      hours with or without a conversion fee.

An _e_x_e_c_u_t_i_v_e_ _s_e_a_r_c_h firm or "headhunter" are industry terms for a third-party
recruiters who seeks out candidates often when normal recruitment efforts have
failed. Headhunters are generally considered more aggressive than in-house
recruiters or may have pre-existing industry experience and contacts. They may
use advanced _s_a_l_e_s_ _t_e_c_h_n_i_q_u_e_s. They may also purchase expensive lists of names
and job titles but more often will generate their own lists. They may arrange a
meeting or a formal interview between their client and the candidate and will
usually prepare the candidate for the interview, help negotiate the salary and
conduct closure to the search. They are frequently members in good standing of
industry trade groups and associations. Headhunters will often attend trade
shows and other meetings nationally or even internationally that may be
attended by potential candidates and hiring managers.
Headhunters are typically small operations that make high margins on candidate
placements (sometimes more than 30% of the candidateâ€™s annual compensation).
Due to their higher costs, headhunters are usually employed to fill senior
management and executive level roles. Headhunters are also used to recruit very
specialized individuals; for example, in some fields, such as emerging
scientific research areas, there may only be a handful of top-level
professionals who are active in the field. In this case, since there are so few
qualified candidates, it makes more sense to directly recruit them one-by-one,
rather than advertise internationally for candidates. While in-house recruiters
tend to attract candidates for specific jobs, headhunters will attract both
candidates and actively seek them out as well. To do so, they may network,
cultivate relationships with various companies, maintain large databases,
purchase company directories or candidate lists and _c_o_l_d_ _c_a_l_l prospective
recruits.
Headhunters are increasingly using _s_o_c_i_a_l_ _m_e_d_i_a to find and research
candidates. This approach is often called _s_o_c_i_a_l_ _r_e_c_r_u_i_t_i_n_g.

These firms are the new hybrid operators in the recruitment world able to
combine the research aspects (discovering passive candidates) of recruiting and
combine them with the ability to make hires for their clients. These firms
provide competitive passive candidate intelligence to support companies'
recruiting efforts. Normally they will generate varying degrees of candidate
information from those people currently engaged in the position a company is
looking to fill. These firms usually charge a daily rate or fixed fee.
Executive research can help companies uncover names that cannot be found
through traditional recruitment methods and will allow internal recruitment and
resourcing managers more time to deal with face to face interviews.

Such sites have two main features: job boards and a _r_Ã_©_s_u_m_Ã_©/curriculum vitae
(CV) database. Job boards allow member companies to post job vacancies.
Alternatively, candidates can upload a rÃ©sumÃ© to be included in searches by
member companies. Fees are charged for job postings and access to search
resumes. Since the late 1990s, the recruitment website has evolved to encompass
end-to-end recruitment. Websites capture candidate details and then pool them
in client accessed candidate management interfaces (also online). Key players
in this sector provide e-recruitment software and services to organizations of
all sizes and within numerous industry sectors, who want to e-enable entirely
or partly their recruitment process in order to improve business performance.
The online software provided by those who specialize in online recruitment
helps organizations attract, test, recruit, employ and retain quality staff
with a minimal amount of administration. Online recruitment websites can be
very helpful to find candidates that are very actively looking for work and
post their resumes online, but they will not attract the "passive" candidates
who might respond favorably to an opportunity that is presented to them through
other means. Also, some candidates who are actively looking to change jobs are
hesitant to put their resumes on the job boards, for fear that their companies,
co-workers, customers or others might see their resumes.

The emergence of _m_e_t_a_-_s_e_a_r_c_h engines allows job-seekers to search across
multiple websites. Some of these new search engines index and list the
advertisements of traditional job boards. These sites tend to aim for providing
a "one-stop shop" for job-seekers. However, there are many other job search
engines which index solely from employers' websites, choosing to bypass
traditional job boards entirely. These _v_e_r_t_i_c_a_l_ _s_e_a_r_c_h engines allow job-
seekers to find new positions that may not be advertised on traditional job

With the emergence of the Internet, also came the functionality to provide
recruitment agencies with a low-cost alternative to advertising. Unlike a
standard directory, these niche directories have helped those searching for
employment representation, a way to narrow down their requirements based on
their own job-searching requirements. Recruitment agencies _[_8_]_[_9_] are then able
to showcase their services directly to those looking.

a competitor or similar type of organisation. Organisations requiring external
recruitment or head-hunting firms are now employing "talent acquisition"
specialists whose job it is to identify, approach and recruit top performing
teams from competitors. This role is a highly specialised role akin to that of
a traditional recruiter/headhunter specialist but carrying greater visibility
and strategic importance to a business. In many cases the talent acquisition
person is linked directly to a company's executive management, given the
potential positive impact a company can benefit from by getting high performing
sales people into the business, whilst removing the same performing sales
people from competitors.
