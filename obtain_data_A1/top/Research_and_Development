The term RR&&DD or rreesseeaarrcchh aanndd ddeevveellooppmmeenntt (also RRnnDD or RRDD especially in _d_o_m_a_i_n

DDeevveellooppmmeenntt or RRTTDD in Europe) refers to a specific group of activities within a
business. The activities that are classified as R&D differ from company to
company, but there are two primary models. In one model, the primary function
of an R&D group is to develop _n_e_w_ _p_r_o_d_u_c_t_s; in the other model, the primary
function of an R&D group is to discover and create new knowledge about
scientific and technological topics for the purpose of uncovering and enabling
development of valuable new products, processes, and services. Under both
models, R&D differs from the vast majority of a company's activities which are
intended to yield nearly immediate profit or immediate improvements in
operations and involve little uncertainty as to the _r_e_t_u_r_n_ _o_n_ _i_n_v_e_s_t_m_e_n_t (ROI).
The first model of R&D is generally staffed by _e_n_g_i_n_e_e_r_s while the second model
may be staffed with _i_n_d_u_s_t_r_i_a_l_ _s_c_i_e_n_t_i_s_t_s. R&D activities are carried out by
corporate (businesses) or governmental entities.

New product design and development is more often than not a crucial factor in
the survival of a company. In an industry that is changing fast, firms must
continually revise their design and range of products. This is necessary due to
continuous technology change and development as well as other competitors and
the changing preference of customers. Without a R&D program, a firm must rely
on _s_t_r_a_t_e_g_i_c_ _a_l_l_i_a_n_c_e_s, _a_c_q_u_i_s_i_t_i_o_n_s, and networks to tap into the innovations
of others.
A system driven by _m_a_r_k_e_t_i_n_g is one that puts the customer needs first, and
only produces goods that are known to sell. Market research is carried out,
which establishes what is needed. If the development is technology driven then
R&D is directed toward developing that market research indicates will meet an
unmet need.
In general, R&D activities are conducted by specialized units or centers
belonging to a company, or can be out-sourced to a contract research
organization, _u_n_i_v_e_r_s_i_t_i_e_s, or _s_t_a_t_e agencies. In the context of _c_o_m_m_e_r_c_e,
"research and development" normally refers to future-oriented, longer-term
activities in _s_c_i_e_n_c_e or _t_e_c_h_n_o_l_o_g_y, using similar techniques to _s_c_i_e_n_t_i_f_i_c
research but directed toward desired outcomes and with broad forecasts of
commercial yield.
_S_t_a_t_i_s_t_i_c_s on organizations devoted to "R&D" may express the state of an
_i_n_d_u_s_t_r_y, the degree of _c_o_m_p_e_t_i_t_i_o_n or the lure of _p_r_o_g_r_e_s_s. Some common
measures include: _b_u_d_g_e_t_s, numbers of _p_a_t_e_n_t_s or on rates of peer-reviewed
_p_u_b_l_i_c_a_t_i_o_n_s. Bank ratios are one of the best measures, because they are
continuously maintained, public and reflect risk.
In the U.S., a typical ratio of research and development for an industrial
company is about 3.5% of revenues; this measure is called "_R_&_D_ _i_n_t_e_n_s_i_t_y". A
high technology company such as a computer manufacturer might spend 7%.
Although _A_l_l_e_r_g_a_n (a _b_i_o_t_e_c_h company) tops the spending table with 43.4%
investment, anything over 15% is remarkable and usually gains a reputation for
being a high technology company. Companies in this category include
_p_h_a_r_m_a_c_e_u_t_i_c_a_l_ _c_o_m_p_a_n_i_e_s such as _M_e_r_c_k_ _&_ _C_o_. (14.1%) or _N_o_v_a_r_t_i_s (15.1%), and
engineering companies like _E_r_i_c_s_s_o_n (24.9%)._[_1_] Such companies are often seen
as credit risks because their spending ratios are so unusual.
Generally such firms prosper only in markets whose customers have extreme
needs, such as medicine, scientific instruments, safety-critical mechanisms
(aircraft) or high technology military armaments. The extreme needs justify the
high risk of failure and consequently high gross margins from 60% to 90% of
revenues. That is, _g_r_o_s_s_ _p_r_o_f_i_t_s will be as much as 90% of the sales cost, with
manufacturing costing only 10% of the product price, because so many individual
projects yield no exploitable product. Most industrial companies get 40%
revenues only.
On a technical level, high tech organizations explore ways to re-purpose and
repackage advanced technologies as a way of _a_m_o_r_t_i_z_i_n_g the high overhead. They
often reuse advanced manufacturing processes, expensive safety certifications,
specialized embedded software, computer-aided design software, electronic
designs and mechanical subsystems.
Research has shown that firms with a persistent R&D strategy outperform those
with an irregular or no R&D investment program._[_2_]

Present-day R&D is core part of the modern business world. Major decisions in
firms are made on base of research and development.
Research and development is of great importance in business as the level of
competition, production processes and methods are rapidly increasing. It is of
special importance in the field of marketing where companies keep an eagle eye
on competitors and customers in order to keep pace with modern trends and
analyze the needs, demands and desires of their customers.
If a company has invested in R&D the results are bound to be good.
Unfortunately, research and development are very difficult to manage, since the
defining feature of research is that the researchers do not know in advance
exactly how to accomplish the desired result. As a result, higher R&D spending
does not guarantee "more creativity, higher profit or a greater market share".

An R&D alliance is a mutually beneficial formal relationship between two or
more parties to pursue a set of agreed upon goals related to acquiring new
knowledge or technological expertise, while remaining independent
organizations. The participating parties agree to combine their resources to
create new innovative products.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]

President Obama requested $147.696 billion for research and development (R&D)
in FY2011. _[_1_] Much of this spending is devoted to basic research on the
mechanisms of disease, which acts as the foundation for the pharmaceutical
industry‚Äôs research where the Federal government supports graduate students
and postdoctoral researchers in academic labs. March 14, 2000,The United States
and Britain signaled solidarity against the aspirations of private companies
looking to profit from early discoveries in the race to map the basic human
genetic code (DNA). Pharmaceutical also hired students as interns while they
are still at under the Federally grant provisions of the University.
