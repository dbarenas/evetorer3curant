RRiisskk mmaannaaggeemmeenntt is the identification, assessment, and prioritization of _r_i_s_k_s
(defined in _I_S_O_ _3_1_0_0_0 as the effect of uncertainty on objectives, whether
positive or negative) followed by coordinated and economical application of
resources to minimize, monitor, and control the probability and/or impact of
unfortunate events_[_1_] or to maximize the realization of opportunities. Risks
can come from uncertainty in financial markets, threats from project failures
(at any phase in design, development, production, or sustainment life-cycles),
legal liabilities, credit risk, accidents, _n_a_t_u_r_a_l_ _c_a_u_s_e_s_ _a_n_d_ _d_i_s_a_s_t_e_r_s as well
as deliberate attack from an adversary, or events of uncertain or unpredictable
_r_o_o_t_-_c_a_u_s_e. Several risk management _s_t_a_n_d_a_r_d_s have been developed including the

_T_e_c_h_n_o_l_o_g_y, actuarial societies, and ISO standards._[_2_]_[_3_] Methods, definitions
and goals vary widely according to whether the risk management method is in the
context of project management, security, _e_n_g_i_n_e_e_r_i_n_g, industrial processes,
financial portfolios, actuarial assessments, or public health and safety.
The strategies to manage threats (uncertainties with negative consequences)
typically include transferring the threat to another party, avoiding the
threat, reducing the negative effect or probability of the threat, or even
accepting some or all of the potential or actual consequences of a particular
threat, and the opposites for opportunities (uncertain future states with
benefits).
Certain aspects of many of the risk management standards have come under
criticism for having no measurable improvement on risk, whether the confidence
in estimates and decisions seem to increase._[_1_]

A widely used vocabulary for risk management is defined by ISO Guide 73, "Risk
management. Vocabulary."_[_2_]
In ideal risk management, a prioritization process is followed whereby the
risks with the greatest loss (or impact) and the greatest _p_r_o_b_a_b_i_l_i_t_y of
occurring are handled first, and risks with lower probability of occurrence and
lower loss are handled in descending order. In practice the process of
assessing overall risk can be difficult, and balancing resources used to
mitigate between risks with a high probability of occurrence but lower loss
versus a risk with high loss but lower probability of occurrence can often be
mishandled.
      Intangible risk management identifies a new type of a risk that has a
      100% probability of occurring but is ignored by the organization due to a
      lack of identification ability. For example, when deficient knowledge is
      applied to a situation, a _k_n_o_w_l_e_d_g_e risk materializes. Relationship risk
      appears when ineffective collaboration occurs. Process-engagement risk
      may be an issue when ineffective operational procedures are applied.
      These risks directly reduce the productivity of knowledge workers,
      decrease cost effectiveness, profitability, service, quality, reputation,
      brand value, and earnings quality. Intangible risk management allows risk
      management to create immediate value from the identification and
      reduction of risks that reduce productivity.
Risk management also faces difficulties in allocating resources. This is the
idea of _o_p_p_o_r_t_u_n_i_t_y_ _c_o_s_t. Resources spent on risk management could have been
spent on more profitable activities. Again, ideal risk management minimizes
spending (or manpower or other resources) and also minimizes the negative
effects of risks.

Risk management should:
    * create _v_a_l_u_e â€“ resources expended to mitigate risk should be less than
      the consequence of inaction, or (as in _v_a_l_u_e_ _e_n_g_i_n_e_e_r_i_n_g), the gain

    * be tailorable
    * take human factors into account
    * be transparent and inclusive
    * be dynamic, iterative and responsive to change
    * be capable of continual improvement and enhancement
    * be continually or periodically re-assessed

According to the standard _I_S_O_ _3_1_0_0_0 "Risk management â€“ Principles and
guidelines on implementation,"_[_3_] the process of risk management consists of
several steps as follows:

This involves:
   1. identification of risk in a selected domain of interest
   2. planning the remainder of the process
   3. mapping out the following:
          o the social scope of risk management
          o the identity and objectives of _s_t_a_k_e_h_o_l_d_e_r_s
          o the basis upon which risks will be evaluated, constraints.
   4. defining a framework for the activity and an agenda for identification
   5. developing an analysis of risks involved in the process
   6. mitigation or solution of risks using available technological, human and
      organizational resources.

After establishing the context, the next step in the process of managing risk
is to identify potential risks. Risks are about events that, when triggered,
cause problems or benefits. Hence, risk identification can start with the
source of our problems and those of our competitors (benefit), or with the
problem itself.
    * Source analysis[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] - Risk sources may be internal or
      external to the system that is the target of risk management (use
      mitigation instead of management since by its own definition risk deals
      with factors of decision-making that cannot be managed).
Examples of risk sources are: stakeholders of a project, employees of a company
or the weather over an airport.
    * Problem analysis[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] - Risks are related to identified
      threats. For example: the threat of losing money, the threat of abuse of
      confidential information or the threat of human errors, accidents and
      casualties. The threats may exist with various entities, most important
      with shareholders, customers and legislative bodies such as the
      government.
When either source or problem is known, the events that a source may trigger or
the events that can lead to a problem can be investigated. For example:
stakeholders withdrawing during a project may endanger funding of the project;
confidential information may be stolen by employees even within a closed
network; lightning striking an aircraft during takeoff may make all people on
board immediate casualties.
The chosen method of identifying risks may depend on culture, industry practice
and compliance. The identification methods are formed by templates or the
development of templates for identifying source, problem or event. Common risk
identification methods are:
    * Objectives-based risk identification[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] - Organizations and
      project teams have objectives. Any event that may endanger achieving an
      objective partly or completely is identified as risk.
    * Scenario-based risk identification - In _s_c_e_n_a_r_i_o_ _a_n_a_l_y_s_i_s different
      scenarios are created. The scenarios may be the alternative ways to
      achieve an objective, or an analysis of the interaction of forces in, for
      example, a market or battle. Any event that triggers an undesired
      scenario alternative is identified as risk â€“ see _F_u_t_u_r_e_s_ _S_t_u_d_i_e_s for
      methodology used by _F_u_t_u_r_i_s_t_s.
    * Taxonomy-based risk identification - The taxonomy in taxonomy-based risk
      identification is a breakdown of possible risk sources. Based on the
      taxonomy and knowledge of best practices, a questionnaire is compiled.
      The answers to the questions reveal risks._[_5_]
    * Common-risk checking[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] - In several industries, lists with
      known risks are available. Each risk in the list can be checked for
      application to a particular situation._[_6_]
    * Risk charting _[_7_] - This method combines the above approaches by listing
      resources at risk, threats to those resources, modifying factors which
      may increase or decrease the risk and consequences it is wished to avoid.
      Creating a _m_a_t_r_i_x under these headings enables a variety of approaches.
      One can begin with resources and consider the threats they are exposed to
      and the consequences of each. Alternatively one can start with the
      threats and examine which resources they would affect, or one can begin
      with the consequences and determine which combination of threats and
      resources would be involved to bring them about.

Once risks have been identified, they must then be assessed as to their
potential severity of impact (generally a negative impact, such as damage or
loss) and to the probability of occurrence. These quantities can be either
simple to measure, in the case of the value of a lost building, or impossible
to know for sure in the case of the probability of an unlikely event occurring.
Therefore, in the assessment process it is critical to make the best educated
decisions in order to properly prioritize the implementation of the _r_i_s_k
_m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t_ _p_l_a_n.
Even a short-term positive improvement can have long-term negative impacts.

traffic capacity leads to greater development in the areas surrounding the
improved traffic capacity. Over time, traffic thereby increases to fill
available capacity. Turnpikes thereby need to be expanded in a seemingly
endless cycles. There are many other engineering examples where expanded
capacity (to do any function) is soon filled by increased demand. Since
expansion comes at a cost, the resulting growth could become unsustainable
without forecasting and management.
The fundamental difficulty in risk assessment is determining the rate of
occurrence since statistical information is not available on all kinds of past
incidents. Furthermore, evaluating the severity of the consequences (impact) is
often quite difficult for intangible assets. Asset valuation is another
question that needs to be addressed. Thus, best educated opinions and available
statistics are the primary sources of information. Nevertheless, risk
assessment should produce such information for the management of the
organization that the primary risks are easy to understand and that the risk
management decisions may be prioritized. Thus, there have been several theories
and attempts to quantify risks. Numerous different risk formulae exist, but
perhaps the most widely accepted formula for risk quantification is:
      Rate (or probability) of occurrence multiplied by the impact of the event
      equals risk magnitude

The above formula can also be re-written in terms of a Composite Risk Index, as
follows:

The impact of the risk event is commonly assessed on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1
and 5 represent the minimum and maximum possible impact of an occurrence of a
risk (usually in terms of financial losses). However, the 1 to 5 scale can be
arbitrary and need not be on a linear scale.
The probability of occurrence is likewise commonly assessed on a scale from 1
to 5, where 1 represents a very low probability of the risk event actually
occurring while 5 represents a very high probability of occurrence. This axis
may be expressed in either mathematical terms (event occurs once a year, once
in ten years, once in 100 years etc.) or may be expressed in "plain english"
(event has occurred here very often; event has been known to occur here; event
has been known to occur in the industry etc.). Again, the 1 to 5 scale can be
arbitrary or non-linear depending on decisions by subject-matter experts.
The Composite Index thus can take values ranging (typically) from 1 through 25,
and this range is usually arbitrarily divided into three sub-ranges. The
overall risk assessment is then Low, Medium or High, depending on the sub-range
containing the calculated value of the Composite Index. For instance, the three
sub-ranges could be defined as 1 to 8, 9 to 16 and 17 to 25.
Note that the probability of risk occurrence is difficult to estimate, since
the past data on frequencies are not readily available, as mentioned above.
After all, probability does not imply certainty.
Likewise, the impact of the risk is not easy to estimate since it is often
difficult to estimate the potential loss in the event of risk occurrence.
Further, both the above factors can change in magnitude depending on the
adequacy of risk avoidance and prevention measures taken and due to changes in
the external business environment. Hence it is absolutely necessary to
periodically re-assess risks and intensify/relax mitigation measures, or as
necessary. Changes in procedures, technology, schedules, budgets, market
conditions, political environment, or other factors typically require re-
assessment of risks.

Risk mitigation measures are usually formulated according to one or more of the
following major risk options, which are:
   1. Design a new business process with adequate built-in risk control and
      containment measures from the start.
   2. Periodically re-assess risks that are accepted in ongoing processes as a
      normal feature of business operations and modify mitigation measures.
   3. Transfer risks to an external agency (e.g. an insurance company)
   4. Avoid risks altogether (e.g. by closing down a particular high-risk
      business area)
Later research[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] has shown that the financial benefits of risk
management are less dependent on the formula used but are more dependent on the
frequency and how risk assessment is performed.
In business it is imperative to be able to present the findings of risk
assessments in financial, market, or schedule terms. Robert Courtney Jr. (IBM,
1970) proposed a formula for presenting risks in financial terms. The Courtney
formula was accepted as the official risk analysis method for the US
governmental agencies. The formula proposes calculation of ALE (annualised loss
expectancy) and compares the expected loss value to the security control
implementation costs (_c_o_s_t_-_b_e_n_e_f_i_t_ _a_n_a_l_y_s_i_s).

Once risks have been identified and assessed, all techniques to manage the risk
fall into one or more of these four major categories:_[_8_]
    * Avoidance (eliminate, withdraw from or not become involved)
    * Reduction (optimize â€“ mitigate)
    * Sharing (transfer â€“ outsource or insure)
    * Retention (accept and budget)
Ideal use of these strategies may not be possible. Some of them may involve
trade-offs that are not acceptable to the organization or person making the
risk management decisions. Another source, from the US Department of Defense
(see link), _D_e_f_e_n_s_e_ _A_c_q_u_i_s_i_t_i_o_n_ _U_n_i_v_e_r_s_i_t_y, calls these categories ACAT, for
Avoid, Control, Accept, or Transfer. This use of the ACAT acronym is
reminiscent of another ACAT (for Acquisition Category) used in US Defense
industry procurements, in which Risk Management figures prominently in decision
making and planning.

This includes not performing an activity that could carry risk. An example
would be not buying a _p_r_o_p_e_r_t_y or business in order to not take on the _l_e_g_a_l

to all risks, but avoiding risks also means losing out on the potential gain
that accepting (retaining) the risk may have allowed. Not entering a business
to avoid the risk of loss also avoids the possibility of earning profits.
Increasing risk regulation in hospitals has led to avoidance of treating higher
risk conditions, in favour of patients presenting with lower risk._[_9_]

_H_a_z_a_r_d prevention refers to the prevention of risks in an emergency. The first

Risk reduction or "optimization" involves reducing the severity of the loss or
the likelihood of the loss from occurring. For example, _s_p_r_i_n_k_l_e_r_s are designed
to put out a _f_i_r_e to reduce the risk of loss by fire. This method may cause a
greater loss by water damage and therefore may not be suitable. _H_a_l_o_n fire
suppression systems may mitigate that risk, but the cost may be prohibitive as
a _s_t_r_a_t_e_g_y.
Acknowledging that risks can be positive or negative, optimizing risks means
finding a balance between negative risk and the benefit of the operation or
activity; and between risk reduction and effort applied. By an offshore
drilling contractor effectively applying HSE Management in its organization, it
can optimize risk to achieve levels of residual risk that are tolerable._[_1_0_]
Modern software development methodologies reduce risk by developing and
delivering software incrementally. Early methodologies suffered from the fact
that they only delivered software in the final phase of development; any
problems encountered in earlier phases meant costly rework and often
jeopardized the whole project. By developing in iterations, software projects
can limit effort wasted to a single iteration.
_O_u_t_s_o_u_r_c_i_n_g could be an example of risk reduction if the outsourcer can
demonstrate higher capability at managing or reducing risks._[_1_1_] For example, a
company may outsource only its software development, the manufacturing of hard
goods, or customer support needs to another company, while handling the
business management itself. This way, the company can concentrate more on
business development without having to worry as much about the manufacturing
process, managing the development team, or finding a physical location for a
call center.

Briefly defined as "sharing with another party the burden of loss or the
benefit of gain, from a risk, and the measures to reduce a risk."
The term of 'risk transfer' is often used in place of risk sharing in the
mistaken belief that you can transfer a risk to a third party through insurance
or outsourcing. In practice if the insurance company or contractor go bankrupt
or end up in court, the original risk is likely to still revert to the first
party. As such in the terminology of practitioners and scholars alike, the
purchase of an insurance contract is often described as a "transfer of risk."
However, technically speaking, the buyer of the contract generally retains
_l_e_g_a_l_ _r_e_s_p_o_n_s_i_b_i_l_i_t_y for the losses "transferred", meaning that insurance may
be described more accurately as a post-event compensatory mechanism. For
example, a personal injuries insurance policy does not transfer the risk of a
car accident to the insurance company. The risk still lies with the policy
holder namely the person who has been in the accident. The insurance policy
simply provides that if an accident (the event) occurs involving the policy
holder then some compensation may be payable to the policy holder that is
commensurate to the suffering/damage.
Some ways of managing risk fall into multiple categories. Risk retention pools
are technically retaining the risk for the group, but spreading it over the
whole group involves transfer among individual members of the group. This is
different from traditional _i_n_s_u_r_a_n_c_e, in that no premium is exchanged between
members of the group up front, but instead losses are assessed to all members
of the group.

Involves accepting the loss, or benefit of gain, from a risk when it occurs.
True _s_e_l_f_ _i_n_s_u_r_a_n_c_e falls in this category. Risk retention is a viable strategy
for small risks where the cost of insuring against the risk would be greater
over time than the total losses sustained. All risks that are not avoided or
transferred are retained by default. This includes risks that are so large or
catastrophic that they either cannot be insured against or the premiums would
be infeasible. _W_a_r is an example since most property and risks are not insured
against war, so the loss attributed by war is retained by the insured. Also any
amounts of potential loss (risk) over the amount insured is retained risk. This
may also be acceptable if the chance of a very large loss is small or if the
cost to insure for greater coverage amounts is so great it would hinder the
goals of the organization too much.

Select appropriate controls or countermeasures to measure each risk. Risk
mitigation needs to be approved by the appropriate level of management. For
instance, a risk concerning the image of the organization should have top
management decision behind it whereas IT management would have the authority to
decide on computer virus risks.
The risk management plan should propose applicable and effective security
controls for managing the risks. For example, an observed high risk of computer
viruses could be mitigated by acquiring and implementing antivirus software. A
good risk management plan should contain a schedule for control implementation
and responsible persons for those actions.

_a_s_s_e_s_s_m_e_n_t phase consists of preparing a Risk Treatment Plan, which should
document the decisions about how each of the identified risks should be
handled. Mitigation of risks often means selection of _s_e_c_u_r_i_t_y_ _c_o_n_t_r_o_l_s, which
should be documented in a Statement of Applicability, which identifies which

Implementation follows all of the planned methods for mitigating the effect of
the risks. Purchase insurance policies for the risks that have been decided to
be transferred to an insurer, avoid all risks that can be avoided without

Initial risk management plans will never be perfect. Practice, experience, and
actual loss results will necessitate changes in the plan and contribute
information to allow possible different decisions to be made in dealing with
the risks being faced.
_R_i_s_k_ _a_n_a_l_y_s_i_s results and management plans should be updated periodically.
There are two primary reasons for this:
   1. to evaluate whether the previously selected security controls are still
      applicable and effective
   2. to evaluate the possible risk level changes in the business environment.
      For example, information risks are a good example of rapidly changing
      business environment.

Prioritizing the risk management processes too highly could keep an
organization from ever completing a project or even getting started. This is
especially true if other work is suspended until the risk management process is
considered complete.
It is also important to keep in mind the distinction between risk and
_u_n_c_e_r_t_a_i_n_t_y. Risk can be measured by impacts x probability.
If risks are improperly assessed and prioritized, time can be wasted in dealing
with risk of losses that are not likely to occur. Spending too much time
assessing and managing unlikely risks can divert resources that could be used
more profitably. Unlikely events do occur but if the risk is unlikely enough to
occur it may be better to simply retain the risk and deal with the result if
the loss does in fact occur. Qualitative risk assessment is subjective and
lacks consistency. The primary justification for a formal risk assessment
process is legal and bureaucratic.

In enterprise risk management, a risk is defined as a possible event or
circumstance that can have negative influences on the enterprise in question.
Its impact can be on the very existence, the resources (human and capital), the
products and services, or the customers of the enterprise, as well as external
impacts on society, markets, or the environment. In a financial institution,
enterprise risk management is normally thought of as the combination of credit
risk, _i_n_t_e_r_e_s_t_ _r_a_t_e_ _r_i_s_k or _a_s_s_e_t_ _l_i_a_b_i_l_i_t_y_ _m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t, liquidity risk, market
risk, and operational risk.
In the more general case, every probable risk can have a pre-formulated plan to
deal with its possible consequences (to ensure contingency if the risk becomes
a liability).
From the information above and the average cost per employee over time, or _c_o_s_t
_a_c_c_r_u_a_l_ _r_a_t_i_o, a project manager can estimate:
    * the cost associated with the risk if it arises, estimated by multiplying
      employee costs per unit time by the estimated time lost (cost impact, C
      where C = cost accrual ratio * S).
    * the probable increase in time associated with a risk (schedule variance
      due to risk, Rs where Rs = P * S):
          o Sorting on this value puts the highest risks to the schedule first.
            This is intended to cause the greatest risks to the project to be
            attempted first so that risk is minimized as quickly as possible.
          o This is slightly misleading as schedule variances with a large P
            and small S and vice versa are not equivalent. (The risk of the _R_M_S
            _T_i_t_a_n_i_c sinking vs. the passengers' meals being served at slightly
            the wrong time).
    * the probable increase in cost associated with a risk (cost variance due
      to risk, Rc where Rc = P*C = P*CAR*S = P*S*CAR)
          o sorting on this value puts the highest risks to the budget first.
          o see concerns about schedule variance as this is a function of it,
            as illustrated in the equation above.

In _p_r_o_j_e_c_t_ _m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t, risk management includes the following activities:
    * Planning how risk will be managed in the particular project. Plans should
      include risk management tasks, responsibilities, activities and budget.
    * Assigning a risk officer â€“ a team member other than a project manager
      who is responsible for foreseeing potential project problems. Typical
      characteristic of risk officer is a healthy skepticism.
    * Maintaining live project risk database. Each risk should have the
      following attributes: opening date, title, short description, probability
      and importance. Optionally a risk may have an assigned person responsible
      for its resolution and a date by which the risk must be resolved.
    * Creating anonymous risk reporting channel. Each team member should have
      the possibility to report risks that he/she foresees in the project.
    * Preparing mitigation plans for risks that are chosen to be mitigated. The
      purpose of the mitigation plan is to describe how this particular risk
      will be handled â€“ what, when, by whom and how will it be done to avoid
      it or minimize consequences if it becomes a liability.

_M_e_g_a_p_r_o_j_e_c_t_s (sometimes also called "major programs") are extremely large-scale
investment projects, typically costing more than US$1 billion per project.
Megaprojects include bridges, tunnels, highways, railways, airports, seaports,
power plants, dams, wastewater projects, coastal flood protection schemes, oil
and natural gas extraction projects, public buildings, information technology
systems, aerospace projects, and defence systems. Megaprojects have been shown
to be particularly risky in terms of finance, safety, and social and
environmental impacts. Risk management is therefore particularly pertinent for
megaprojects and special methods and special education have been developed for
such risk management._[_1_2_]

For the offshore oil and gas industry, operational risk management is regulated
by the _s_a_f_e_t_y_ _c_a_s_e regime in many countries. Hazard identification and risk
assessment tools and techniques are described in the international standard ISO
17776:2000, and organisations such as the IADC (International Association of
Drilling Contractors) publish guidelines for HSE Case development which are
based on the ISO standard. Further, diagrammatic representations of hazardous
events are often expected by governmental regulators as part of risk management
in safety case submissions; these are known as bbooww--ttiiee diagrams. The technique
is also used by organisations and regulators in mining, aviation, health,

Positive Risk Management is an approach that recognizes the importance of the
human factor and of individual differences in propensity for risk taking. It
draws from the work of a number of academics and professionals who have
expressed concerns about scientific rigor of the wider risk management debate,
_[_1_9_] or who have made a contribution emphasizing the human dimension of risk.
_[_2_0_]_[_2_1_]
Firstly, it recognizes that any object or situation can be rendered hazardous
by the involvement of someone with an inappropriate disposition towards risk;
whether too risk taking or too risk averse.
Secondly, it recognizes that risk is an inevitable and ever present element
throughout life: from conception through to the point at the end of life when
we finally lose our personal battle with life threatening risk.
Thirdly, it recognizes that every individual has a particular orientation
towards risk; while at one extreme people may by nature be timid, anxious and
fearful, others will be adventurous, impulsive and almost oblivious to danger.
These differences are evident in the way we drive our cars, in our diets, in
our relationships, in our careers.
Finally, Positive Risk Management recognizes that risk taking is essential to
all enterprise, creativity, heroism, education, scientific advance â€“ in fact
to any activity and all the initiatives that have contributed to our
evolutionary success and civilization. It is worth noting how many enjoyable
activities involve fear and willingly embrace risk taking.
Within the entire Risk Management literature (and this section of Wikipedia)
you will find little or no reference to the human part of the risk equation
other than what might be implied by the term 'compliant'. This illustrates the
narrow focus that is a hall mark of much current risk management practice. This
situation arises from the basic premises of traditional risk management and the
practices associated with health and safety within the working environment.
There is a basic logic to the idea that any accident must reflect some kind of
oversight or situational predisposition that, if identified, can be rectified.
But, largely due to an almost institutionalised neglect of the human factor,
this situationally focused paradigm has grown tendrils that reach into every
corner of modern life and into situations where the unintended negative
consequences threaten to outweigh the benefits.
Positive Risk Management views both risk taking and risk aversion as
complementary and of equal value and importance within the appropriate context.
As such, it is seen as complementary to the traditional risk management
paradigm. It introduces a much needed balance to risk management practices and
puts greater onus on management skills and decision making. It is the dynamic
approach of the football manager who appreciates the offensive and defensive
talents within the available pool of players. Every organisation has roles
better suited to risk takers and roles better suited to the risk averse. The
task of management is to ensure that the right people are placed in each job.
Positive Risk Management relies on the ability to identify individual
differences in propensity for risk taking. The science in this area has been
developing rapidly over the past decade within the domain of personality
assessment. Once an area of almost tribal allegiance to different schools of
thought, today there is wide spread consensus about the structure of
personality assessment and its status within the framework of the cross
disciplinary progress being made in our understanding of Human Nature. The Five
Factor Model (FFM)_[_2_2_] of personality has been shown to have relevance across
many different cultures, to remain consistent over adult working life and to be
significantly heritable. Within this framework there are many strands which
have a clear relationship to risk tolerance and risk taking. For example,
Eysenck (1973) reports that personality influences whether we focus on what
might go wrong or on potential benefits;_[_2_3_] Nicholson et al. (2005) report
that higher extroversion is related to greater risk tolerance;_[_2_4_] McCrae and
Costa (1997) link personality to tolerance of uncertainty, innovation and
willingness to think outside the box;_[_2_5_] Kowert, 1997) links personality to
adventurousness, imagination, the search for new experiences and actively
seeking out risk._[_2_6_] Building from these foundations of well validated
assessment practices, more specialized assessments have been developed,
including assessment of Risk Type._[_2_7_]

found that the notion of complementarity may be a concept that does not work in
practice. In a four-year organizational study of risk management in a leading
healthcare organization, _F_i_s_c_h_e_r_ _&_ _F_e_r_l_i_e ( 2013) found major contradictions
between rules-based risk management required by managers, and ethics-based
self-regulation favoured by staff and clients. This produced tensions that led
neither to complementarity nor to hybrid forms, but produced instead a heated
and intractable conflict which escalated, resulting in crisis and
organizational collapse._[_2_8_]
The graveyard of former greats is littered with examples where the balance of
risk went seriously awry; the ENRON and RBS stories have become iconic
references in the pantheon of corporate governance and corporate mortality.

averse.

Risk management is simply a practice of systematically selecting cost effective
approaches for minimising the effect of threat realization to the organization.
All risks can never be fully avoided or mitigated simply because of financial
and practical limitations. Therefore all organizations have to accept some
level of residual risks.
Whereas risk management tends to be preemptive, _b_u_s_i_n_e_s_s_ _c_o_n_t_i_n_u_i_t_y_ _p_l_a_n_n_i_n_g
(BCP) was invented to deal with the consequences of realised residual risks.
The necessity to have BCP in place arises because even very unlikely events
will occur if given enough time. Risk management and BCP are often mistakenly
seen as rivals or overlapping practices. In fact these processes are so tightly
tied together that such separation seems artificial. For example, the risk
management process creates important inputs for the BCP (assets, impact
assessments, cost estimates etc.). Risk management also proposes applicable
controls for the observed risks. Therefore, risk management covers several
areas that are vital for the BCP process. However, the BCP process goes beyond
risk management's preemptive approach and assumes that the disaster wwiillll happen
at some point.

Risk communication is a complex cross-disciplinary academic field. Problems for
risk communicators involve how to reach the intended audience, to make the risk
comprehensible and relatable to other risks, how to pay appropriate respect to
the audience's values related to the risk, how to predict the audience's
response to the communication, etc. A main goal of risk communication is to
improve collective and individual decision making. Risk communication is
