A ssaallee is the act of _s_e_l_l_i_n_g a product or service in return for money or other
compensation._[_1_] Signalling completion of the prospective stage, it is the
beginning of an engagement between customer and vendor or the extension of that
engagement.

_n_e_e_d_e_d] or to a request. There follows the passing of title (property or
ownership) in the item, and the application and due settlement of a price, the
obligation for which arises due to the seller's requirement to pass ownership.
Ideally, a seller agrees upon a price at which he willingly parts with
ownership of or any claim upon the item. The purchaser, though a party to the
sale, does not execute the sale, only the seller does that. To be precise the
sale completes prior to the payment and gives rise to the obligation of
payment. If the seller completes the first two above stages (consent and
passing ownership) of the sale prior to settlement of the price, the sale
remains valid and gives rise to an obligation to pay.

Agents in the sales process can represent either of two parties in the sales
process; for example:
   1. Sales broker, Seller agency, seller agent, _s_e_l_l_e_r_ _r_e_p_r_e_s_e_n_t_a_t_i_v_e: This is
      a traditional role where the salesman represents a person or company on
      the selling end of a deal.
   2. Buyers broker or Buyer brokerage: This is where the salesman represents
      the consumer making the purchase. This is most often applied in large
      transactions.
   3. Disclosed dual agent:This is where the salesman represents both parties
      in the sale and acts as a _m_e_d_i_a_t_o_r for the transaction. The role of the
      salesman here is to oversee that both parties receive an honest and fair
      deal, and is responsible to both.
   4. Transaction broker: This is where the salesperson represents neither
      party but handles the transaction only. The seller owes no responsibility
      to either party getting a fair or honest deal, just that all of the
      papers are handled properly.
   5. Sales outsourcing involves direct branded representation where the sales
      representatives are recruited, hired, and managed by an external entity
      but hold quotas, represent themselves as the brand of the client, and
      report all activities (through their own sales management channels) back
      to the client. It is akin to a virtual extension of a sales force (see
      _s_a_l_e_s_ _o_u_t_s_o_u_r_c_i_n_g).
   6. Sales managers aim to implement various sales strategies and management
      techniques in order to facilitate improved _p_r_o_f_i_t_s and increased sales
      volume. They are also responsible for coordinating the sales and
      marketing department as well as oversight concerning the _f_a_i_r and _h_o_n_e_s_t
      execution of the sales process by their agents.
   7. Salesperson: The primary function of professional sales is to generate
      and close _l_e_a_d_s, educate prospects, fill needs and satisfy wants of
      consumers appropriately, and therefore turn prospective customers into
      actual ones. Questioning ‚Äì to understand a customer's goal and
      requirements relevant to the product ‚Äì and the creation of a valuable
      solution by communicating the necessary information that encourages a
      buyer to achieve their goal at an economic cost comprise the functions of
      the salesperson or of the sales engine (for example, the Internet, a

Since the advent of the _t_e_l_e_p_h_o_n_e, a distinction has been made_[_3_] between
"inside sales" and "outside sales" although it is generally agreed that those
terms have no hard-and-fast definition._[_4_] In the United States, the _F_a_i_r_ _L_a_b_o_r
_S_t_a_n_d_a_r_d_s_ _A_c_t defines outside sales representatives as "employees [who] sell
their employer's products, services, or facilities to customers away from their
employer's place(s) of business, in general, either at the customer's place of
business or by selling door-to-door at the customer's home" while defining
those who work "from the employer's location" as inside sales._[_5_] Inside sales
generally involves attempting to _c_l_o_s_e_ _b_u_s_i_n_e_s_s primarily over the phone via
_t_e_l_e_m_a_r_k_e_t_i_n_g, while outside sales (or "field" sales) will usually involve
initial phone work to book sales calls at the potential buyer's location to
attempt to close the deal in person. Some companies have an inside sales
department that works with outside representatives and book their appointments
for them. Inside sales sometimes refers to _u_p_s_e_l_l_i_n_g to existing customers.
Nowadays inside sales has become more and more popular in the telemarketing
business, and so, there are several tools developed to serve this niche market.
These tools help companies to manage their inside sales more efficiently.
Software vendors for inside sales include _S_a_l_e_s_f_o_r_c_e_._c_o_m, _I_n_s_i_d_e_S_a_l_e_s_._c_o_m and

_M_a_r_k_e_t_i_n_g and sales differ greatly, but have the same goal. Selling is the
final stage in Marketing, which also includes Pricing, Promotion, Positioning
and Product (the 4Ps). A _m_a_r_k_e_t_i_n_g department in an organization has the goals
of increasing the desirability and value to the customer and increasing the
number and engagement of interactions between potential customers and the
organization. Achieving this goal may involve the sales team using promotional
techniques such as _a_d_v_e_r_t_i_s_i_n_g, _s_a_l_e_s_ _p_r_o_m_o_t_i_o_n, _p_u_b_l_i_c_i_t_y, and _p_u_b_l_i_c
_r_e_l_a_t_i_o_n_s, creating new _s_a_l_e_s_ _c_h_a_n_n_e_l_s, or creating new products (_n_e_w_ _p_r_o_d_u_c_t
_d_e_v_e_l_o_p_m_e_n_t), among other things. It can also include bringing the potential
customer to visit the organization's website(s) for more information, or to
contact the organization for more information, or to interact with the
organization via social media such as _T_w_i_t_t_e_r, _F_a_c_e_b_o_o_k and _b_l_o_g_s.
The relatively new[_w_h_e_n_?] field of _s_a_l_e_s_ _p_r_o_c_e_s_s_ _e_n_g_i_n_e_e_r_i_n_g views "sales" as
the output of a larger system, not just as the output of one department. The
larger system includes many functional areas within an organization. From this
perspective, "sales" and "marketing" (among others, such as "_c_u_s_t_o_m_e_r_ _s_e_r_v_i_c_e")
label for a number of processes whose inputs and outputs supply one another to
varying degrees. In this context, improving an "output" (such as sales)
involves studying and improving the broader sales process, as in any system,
since the component functional areas interact and are interdependent._[_6_]
Most large corporations structure their marketing departments in a similar
fashion to sales departments[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] and the managers of these teams
must coordinate efforts in order to drive profits and business success. For
example, an "inbound" focused campaign seeks to drive more customers "through
the door", giving the sales department a better chance of selling their product
to the consumer. A good marketing program would address any potential downsides
as well.
The sales department would aim to improve the interaction between the customer
and the sales facility or mechanism (example, web site) and/or salesperson.
Sales management would break down the selling process and then increase the
effectiveness of the discrete processes as well as the interaction between
processes. For example, in many out-bound sales environments, the typical
process includes out-bound calling, the sales pitch, handling objections,
opportunity identification, and the close. Each step of the process has sales-
related issues, skills, and training needs, as well as marketing solutions to
improve each discrete step, as well as the whole process.
One further common complication of marketing involves the inability to measure
results for a great deal of marketing initiatives. In essence, many marketing
and advertising executives often lose sight of the objective of sales/revenue/
profit, as they focus on establishing a creative/innovative program, without
concern for the _t_o_p or _b_o_t_t_o_m_ _l_i_n_e_s - a fundamental pitfall of marketing for
marketing's sake.
Many companies find it challenging to get marketing and sales on the same page.
[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] The two departments, although different in nature, handle
very similar concepts and have to work together for sales to be successful.
Building a good relationship between the two that encourages communication can
be the key to success - even in a _d_o_w_n_ _e_c_o_n_o_m_y._[_7_]

Some sales authors and consultants contend that an expertly planned and
executed marketing strategy may negate the need for outside sales entirely.
They suggest that by effectively bringing more customers "through the door" and
enticing them into contact, sales organizations can dramatically improve their
results, efficiency, profitability, and allow salespeople to provide a
drastically higher level of _c_u_s_t_o_m_e_r_ _s_e_r_v_i_c_e and satisfaction. This is commonly
referred to as a "Pull" marketing strategy. Marketing and advertising efforts
are designed to pull potential customers into the sales channel. Alternatively,
some companies invest spending on the sales force in pursuit of uncovering new
sales leads. This is referred to as a push strategy; the sales force is
motivated to uncover leads and push them into the sales channel. For example
consumer packaged goods companies typically use a pull strategy relying on
advertising and marketing efforts to translate into sales at the retail end
point. Technical sales and sales of high out of pocket cost items typically
rely on a push strategy as a more sophisticated sales technique is required to
attract and educate customers about their products._[_8_]

The idea that marketing can potentially eliminate the need for sales people
depends entirely on context. For example, this may be possible in some _B_2_C
situations; however, for many _B_2_B transactions (for example, those involving
industrial organizations) this is mostly impossible.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] Another
dimension is the value of the goods being sold. _F_a_s_t_-_m_o_v_i_n_g_ _c_o_n_s_u_m_e_r_-_g_o_o_d_s
(FMCG) require no sales people at the point of sale to get them to jump off the
supermarket shelf and into the customer's trolley. However, the purchase of
large mining equipment worth millions of dollars will require a sales person to
manage the sales process - particularly in the face of competitors. Small and
medium businesses selling such large ticket items to a geographically-disperse
client base use _M_a_n_u_f_a_c_t_u_r_e_r_s_'_ _r_e_p_r_e_s_e_n_t_a_t_i_v_e_s to provide these highly personal
service while avoiding the large expense of a captive sales force.

Another area of discussion involves the need for alignment and integration
between corporate sales and marketing functions. According to a report from the
Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) Council, only 40 percent of companies have formal
programs, systems or processes in place to align and integrate the two critical
functions.
Traditionally, these two functions, as referenced above, have operated
separately, left in siloed areas of tactical responsibility. Glen Petersen‚Äôs
book The _P_r_o_f_i_t_ _M_a_x_i_m_i_z_a_t_i_o_n Paradox_[_9_] sees the changes in the competitive
landscape between the 1950s and the time of writing as so dramatic that the
complexity of choice, price and opportunities for the customer forced this
seemingly simple and integrated relationship between sales and marketing to
change forever. Petersen goes on to highlight that salespeople spend
approximately 40 percent of their time preparing customer-facing deliverables
while leveraging less than 50 percent of the materials created by marketing,
adding to perceptions that marketing is out of touch with the customer and that
sales is resistant to _m_e_s_s_a_g_i_n_g and _s_t_r_a_t_e_g_y.
