SSoocciiaall mmeeddiiaa refers to the means of interactions among people in which they
create, share, and exchange information and ideas in virtual communities and
networks._[_1_] _A_n_d_r_e_a_s_ _K_a_p_l_a_n and Michael Haenlein define social media as "a
group of Internet-based applications that build on the ideological and
technological foundations of _W_e_b_ _2_._0, and that allow the creation and exchange
of _u_s_e_r_-_g_e_n_e_r_a_t_e_d_ _c_o_n_t_e_n_t."_[_2_] Furthermore, social media depends on mobile and
web-based technologies to create highly interactive platforms through which
individuals and communities share, co-create, discuss, and modify user-
generated content. It introduces substantial and pervasive changes to
communication between organizations, communities, and individuals._[_3_]
Social media differentiates from traditional/industrial media in many aspects
such as quality,_[_4_] reach, frequency, usability, immediacy, and permanence._[_5_]
There are many effects that stem from internet usage. According to Nielsen,
internet users continue to spend more time with social media sites than any
other type of site. At the same time, the total time spent on social media in
the U.S. across PC and mobile devices increased by 37 percent to 121 billion
minutes in July 2012 compared to 88 billion minutes in July 2011._[_6_] For
content contributors, the benefits of participating in social media have gone
beyond simply social sharing to building reputation and bringing in career
opportunities and monetary income, as discussed in Tang, Gu, and Whinston
(2012)._[_7_]
Much of the criticism of social media are about its exclusiveness[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n
_n_e_e_d_e_d] as most sites do not allow the transfer of information from one to
another, disparity of information available, issues with trustworthiness and
reliability of information presented, concentration, ownership of media
content, and the meaning of interactions created by social media. However, it
is also argued that social media has positive effects such as allowing the
democratization of the internet_[_8_] while also allowing individuals to advertise
themselves and form friendships._[_9_]
Most people[_w_h_o_?] associate social media with positive outcomes[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n
_n_e_e_d_e_d], yet this is not always the case. Due to the increase in social media
websites, there seems to be a positive correlation between the usage of such
media with cyber bullying, online sexual predators, and the decrease in face-
to-face interactions. Social media may expose children to images of alcohol,
_t_o_b_a_c_c_o, and sexual behaviors[_r_e_l_e_v_a_n_t_? ‚Äì _d_i_s_c_u_s_s]._[_1_0_]
_G_e_o_c_i_t_i_e_s, created in 1994, was one of the first social media sites. The
concept was for users to create their own websites, characterized by one of six
"cities" that were known for certain characteristics._[_1_1_]

Social media technologies take on many different forms including magazines,
_I_n_t_e_r_n_e_t_ _f_o_r_u_m_s, _w_e_b_l_o_g_s, _s_o_c_i_a_l_ _b_l_o_g_s, _m_i_c_r_o_b_l_o_g_g_i_n_g, _w_i_k_i_s, _s_o_c_i_a_l_ _n_e_t_w_o_r_k_s,

Technologies include: blogs, picture-sharing, _v_l_o_g_s, wall-postings, music-
sharing, _c_r_o_w_d_s_o_u_r_c_i_n_g and _v_o_i_c_e_ _o_v_e_r_ _I_P, to name a few. Many of these services
can be integrated via _s_o_c_i_a_l_ _n_e_t_w_o_r_k_ _a_g_g_r_e_g_a_t_i_o_n platforms. By applying a set
of theories in the field of media research (social presence, media richness)
and social processes (self-presentation, self-disclosure) Kaplan and Haenlein
created a classification scheme in their Business Horizons (2010) article, with
six different types of social media: collaborative projects (for example,
_W_i_k_i_p_e_d_i_a), blogs and microblogs (for example, _T_w_i_t_t_e_r), content communities
(for example, _Y_o_u_T_u_b_e and _D_a_i_l_y_M_o_t_i_o_n), social networking sites (for example,
Facebook), virtual game worlds (e.g., _W_o_r_l_d_ _o_f_ _W_a_r_c_r_a_f_t), and virtual social
worlds (e.g. _S_e_c_o_n_d_ _L_i_f_e). However, the boundaries between the different types
have been increasingly blurred. For example, Shi, Rui and Whinston (2013)
argues that Twitter, as a combination of broadcasting service and social
network, is better to be classified as a "social broadcasting technology."_[_1_2_]

When social media is used in combination with mobile devices it is called
mobile social media. This is a group of mobile marketing applications that
allow the creation and exchange of user-generated content._[_1_3_] Due to the fact
that mobile social media runs on mobile devices, it differentiates from
traditional social media as it incorporates new factors such as the current
location of the user (location-sensitivity) or the time delay between sending
and receiving messages(time-sensitivity). According to _A_n_d_r_e_a_s_ _K_a_p_l_a_n, mobile
social media applications can be differentiated among four types:_[_1_3_]
   1. Space-timers (location and time sensitive): Exchange of messages with
      relevance for one specific location at one specific point in time (e.g.,
      _F_a_c_e_b_o_o_k_ _P_l_a_c_e_s; _F_o_u_r_s_q_u_a_r_e)
   2. Space-locators (only location sensitive): Exchange of messages, with
      relevance for one specific location, which are tagged to a certain place
      and read later by others (e.g., _Y_e_l_p; _Q_y_p_e)
   3. Quick-timers (only time sensitive): Transfer of traditional social media
      applications to mobile devices to increase immediacy (e.g., posting
      _T_w_i_t_t_e_r messages or _F_a_c_e_b_o_o_k status updates)
   4. Slow-timers (neither location, nor time sensitive): Transfer of
      traditional social media applications to mobile devices (e.g., watching a
      _Y_o_u_T_u_b_e video or reading a _W_i_k_i_p_e_d_i_a entry)
******** MMoobbiillee ssoocciiaall mmeeddiiaa aanndd bbuussiinneessss ppootteennttiiaall[[_ee_dd_ii_tt_ _ss_oo_uu_rr_cc_ee¬¬ || _ee_dd_ii_tt]] ********
While traditional social media offer a variety of opportunities for companies
in a wide range of business sectors, mobile social media makes use of the
location- and time-sensitivity aspects of it in order to engage into marketing
research, communication, sales promotions/discounts, and relationship
development/loyalty programs._[_1_3_]
    * Marketing research: Mobile social media applications offer data about
      offline consumer movements at a level of detail heretofore limited to
      online companies. Any firm can now know the exact time at which a
      customer entered one of its outlets, as well as comments made during the
      visit._[_1_3_]
    * Communication: Mobile social media communication takes two forms, the
      first of which is company-to-consumer in which a company may establish a
      connection to a consumer based on its location and provide reviews about
      locations nearby. The second type of communication is user-generated
      content. For example, McDonald's offered $5 and $10 gift cards to 100
      users randomly selected among those checking in at one of the
      restaurants. This promotion increased check-ins by 33% (from 2,146 to
      2,865), resulted in over 50 articles and blog posts, and prompted several
      hundred thousand news feeds and Twitter messages._[_1_3_]
    * Sales promotions and discounts: While in the past customers had to use
      printed coupons, mobile social media allows companies to tailor
      promotions to specific users at specific times. For example, when
      launching its California-Cancun service, Virgin America offered users who
      checked in through Loopt at one of three designated Border Grill taco
      trucks in San Francisco and Los Angeles between 11 am and 3 pm on August
      31, 2010, two tacos for $1 and two flights to Mexico for the price of
      one._[_1_3_]
    * Relationship development and loyalty programs: In order to increase long-
      term relationships with customers, companies are able to create loyalty
      programs that allow customers who check-in regularly at a location to
      earn discounts or perks. For example, American Eagle Outfitters
      remunerates such customers with a tiered 10%, 15%, or 20% discount on
      their total purchase._[_1_3_]
    * E-Commerce: Mobile social media applications such as _A_m_a_z_o_n_._c_o_m and
      _P_i_n_t_e_r_e_s_t are influencing an upward trend in the popularity and
      accessibility of e-commerce, or online purchases._[_1_4_]
Business Marketing Analysts have stated that one of the key take aways of the
_N_i_e_l_s_e_n_ _C_o_m_p_a_n_y's "State of the media: The social media report 2012"_[_6_] is that
more consumers are accessing social media content today via mobile platforms,
especially apps._[_1_5_]

_E_-_c_o_m_m_e_r_c_e businesses may refer to social media as _c_o_n_s_u_m_e_r_-_g_e_n_e_r_a_t_e_d_ _m_e_d_i_a
(CGM). A common thread running through all definitions of social media is a
blending of technology and social interaction for the co-creation of value._[_5_]
People obtain information, education, news, and other data from electronic and
print media. Social media are distinct from industrial or traditional media
such as newspapers, television, and film as they are comparatively inexpensive
and accessible. They enable anyone (even private individuals) to publish or
access information. Industrial media generally require significant resources to
publish information as in most cases the articles goes through many revisions
before being published.
One characteristic shared by both social and industrial media is the capability
to reach small or large audiences; for example, either a blog post or a
television show may reach no people or millions of people. Some of the
properties that help describe the differences between social and industrial
media are:_[_5_]
   1. Quality: In industrial(traditional) publishing‚Äîmediated by a
      publisher‚Äîthe typical range of quality is substantially narrower than
      in niche, unmediated markets. The main challenge posed by content in
      social media sites is the fact that the distribution of quality has high
      variance: from very high-quality items to low-quality, sometimes abusive
      content._[_4_]
   2. Reach: Both industrial and social media technologies provide scale and
      are capable of reaching a global audience. Industrial media, however,
      typically use a centralized framework for organization, production, and
      dissemination, whereas social media are by their very nature more
      decentralized, less hierarchical, and distinguished by multiple points of
      production and utility._[_5_]
   3. Frequency: The number of times an advertisement is displayed on social
      media platforms.
   4. Accessibility: The means of production for industrial media are typically
      government and/or corporate (privately owned); social media tools are
      generally available to the public at little or no cost._[_5_]
   5. Usability: Industrial media production typically requires specialized
      skills and training. Conversely, most social media production requires
      only modest reinterpretation of existing skills; in theory, anyone with
      access can operate the means of social media production._[_5_]
   6. Immediacy: The time lag between communications produced by industrial
      media can be long (days, weeks, or even months) compared to social media
      (which can be capable of virtually instantaneous responses)._[_5_]
   7. Permanence: Industrial media, once created, cannot be altered (once a
      magazine article is printed and distributed, changes cannot be made to
      that same article) whereas social media can be altered almost
      instantaneously by comments or editing._[_5_]
Community media constitute a hybrid of industrial and social media. Though
community-owned, some community radio, TV, and newspapers are run by
professionals and some by amateurs. They use both social and industrial media
frameworks.
Social media has also been recognized for the way in which it has changed how
public relations professionals conduct their jobs. It has provided an open
arena where people are free to exchange ideas on companies, brands, and
products. As stated by Doc Searls and David Wagner, two authorities on the
effects of Internet on marketing, advertising, and PR, "The best of the people
in PR are not PR types at all. They understand that there aren't censors,
they're the company's best conversationalists."_[_1_6_] Social media provides an
environment where users and PR professionals can converse, and where PR
professionals can promote their brand and improve their company's image by
listening and responding to what the public is saying about their product.

There is an increasing trend towards using _s_o_c_i_a_l_ _m_e_d_i_a_ _m_o_n_i_t_o_r_i_n_g tools that
allow marketers to search, track, and analyze conversation on the web about
their brand or about topics of interest. This can be useful in PR management
and campaign tracking, allowing the user to measure _r_e_t_u_r_n_ _o_n_ _i_n_v_e_s_t_m_e_n_t,
competitor-auditing, and general public engagement. Tools range from free,
basic applications to subscription-based, more in-depth tools.
The honeycomb framework defines how social media services focus on some or all
of seven functional building blocks._[_3_] These building blocks help explain the
engagement needs of the social media audience. For instance, _L_i_n_k_e_d_I_n users are
thought to care mostly about identity, reputation, and relationships, whereas
YouTube‚Äôs primary features are sharing, conversations, groups, and
reputation. Many companies build their own social containers that attempt to
link the seven functional building blocks around their brands. These are
private communities that engage people around a more narrow theme, as in around
a particular brand, vocation or hobby, rather than social media containers such
as _G_o_o_g_l_e_+, _F_a_c_e_b_o_o_k, and _T_w_i_t_t_e_r. PR departments face significant challenges
in dealing with viral negative sentiment directed at organizations or

According to Jan H. Kietzmann, the honeycomb framework of social media is based
on the following functional building blocks:_[_3_]
    * Identity: The identity block represents the extent to which users reveal
      their identities in a social media setting. This can include disclosing
      information such as name, age, gender, profession, location, and also
      information that portrays users in certain ways._[_3_]
    * Conversations: The conversations block of the framework represents the
      extent to which users communicate with other users in a social media
      setting. Many social media sites are designed primarily to facilitate
      conversations among individuals and groups. These conversations happen
      for all sorts of reasons. People tweet, blog, et cetera to meet new like-
      minded people, to Ô¨Ånd true love, to build their self-esteem, or to be
      on the cutting edge of new ideas or trending topics. Yet others see
      social media as a way of making their message heard and positively
      impacting humanitarian causes, environmental problems, economic issues,
      or political debates._[_3_]
    * Sharing: Sharing represents the extent to which users exchange,
      distribute, and receive content. The term ‚Äòsocial‚Äô often implies that
      exchanges between people are crucial. In many cases, however, sociality
      is about the objects that mediate these ties between people‚Äîthe reasons
      why they meet online and associate with each other._[_3_]
    * Presence: The framework building block presence represents the extent to
      which users can know if other users are accessible. It includes knowing
      where others are, in the virtual world and/or in the real world, and
      whether they are available._[_3_]
    * Relationships: The relationships block represents the extent to which
      users can be related to other users. By ‚Äòrelate,‚Äô we mean that two or
      more users have some form of association that leads them to converse,
      share objects of sociality, meet up, or simply just list each other as a
      friend or fan._[_3_]
    * Reputation: Reputation is the extent to which users can identify the
      standing of others, including themselves, in a social media setting.
      Reputation can have different meanings on social media platforms. In most
      cases, reputation is a matter of trust, but since information
      technologies are not yet good at determining such highly qualitative
      criteria, social media sites rely on ‚Äòmechanical Turks‚Äô: tools that
      automatically aggregate user-generated information to determine
      trustworthiness._[_3_]
    * Groups: The group functional block represents the extent to which users
      can form communities and sub communities. The more ‚Äòsocial‚Äô a network
      becomes, the bigger the group of friends, followers, and contacts._[_3_]

It is through this process of "building social authority" that social media
becomes effective. One of the foundational concepts in social media has become
that you cannot completely control your message through social media but rather
you can simply begin to participate in the "conversation" expecting that you
can achieve a significant influence in that conversation._[_1_8_]
However, this conversation participation must be cleverly executed because
while people are resistant to marketing in general, they are even more
resistant to direct or overt marketing through social media platforms. This may
seem counterintuitive but is the main reason building social authority with
credibility is so important. A marketer can generally not expect people to be
receptive to a marketing message in and of itself. In the _E_d_e_l_m_a_n_ _T_r_u_s_t
_B_a_r_o_m_e_t_e_r_ _r_e_p_o_r_t in 2008, the majority (58%) of the respondents reported they
most trusted company or product information coming from "people like me"
inferred to be information from someone they trusted. In the _2_0_1_0_ _T_r_u_s_t_ _R_e_p_o_r_t,
the majority switched to 64% preferring their information from industry experts
and academics. According to Inc. Technology's Brent Leary, "This loss of trust,
and the accompanying turn towards experts and authorities, seems to be
coinciding with the rise of social media and networks."_[_1_9_]_[_2_0_]

An increasing number of scholars have sought to study and measure the impact of
social media. A 2010 study by the _U_n_i_v_e_r_s_i_t_y_ _o_f_ _M_a_r_y_l_a_n_d suggested that social
media services may be addictive,_[_2_1_] and that using social media services may
lead to a "fear of missing out," also known as the phrase "FOMO" by many
students._[_2_2_] It has been observed that _F_a_c_e_b_o_o_k is now the primary method for
communication by college students in the U.S._[_2_3_]_[_2_4_] According to Nielsen,
global consumers spend more than six hours on social networking sites. "Social
Media Revolution" produced by Socialnomics author _E_r_i_k_ _Q_u_a_l_m_a_n contains
numerous statistics on social media including the fact that 93% of businesses
use it for marketing and that if Facebook were a country it would be the third
largest._[_2_5_] Several colleges and universities such as Harvard, Johns Hopkins,
Columbia and Stanford among others have even introduced classes on best social
media practices, preparing students for potential careers as digital
strategists._[_2_6_]
There are various statistics that account for social media usage and
effectiveness for individuals worldwide. Some of the most recent statistics are
as follows:

News media and television journalism have been instrumental in the shaping of
American collective memory for much of the twentieth century._[_3_8_]_[_3_9_] Indeed,
since the United States‚Äô colonial era, news media has influenced collective
memory and discourse about national development and trauma.In many ways,
mainstream journalists have maintained an authoritative voice as the
storytellers of the American past. Their documentary style narratives, detailed
exposes, and their positions in the present make them prime sources for public
memory. Specifically, news media journalists have shaped collective memory on
nearly every major national event ‚Äì from the deaths of social and political
figures to the progression of political hopefuls. Journalists provide elaborate
descriptions of commemorative events in U.S. history and contemporary popular
cultural sensations. Many Americans learn the significance of historical events
and political issues through news media, as they are presented on popular news
stations._[_4_0_] However, journalistic influence is growing less important, while
social networking sites such as _F_a_c_e_b_o_o_k, YouTube and _T_w_i_t_t_e_r, provide a
constant source of alternative news sources for users.
As _s_o_c_i_a_l_ _n_e_t_w_o_r_k_i_n_g becomes more popular among older and younger generations,
sites such as Facebook and YouTube, gradually undermine the traditionally
authoritative voices of news media. For example, American citizens contest
media coverage of various social and political events as they see fit,
inserting their voices into the narratives about America‚Äôs past and present
and shaping their own collective memories._[_4_1_]_[_4_2_] An example of this is the
public explosion of the _T_r_a_y_v_o_n_ _M_a_r_t_i_n shooting in Sanford, Florida. News media
coverage of the incident was minimal until social media users made the story
recognizable through their constant discussion of the case. Approximately one
month after the fatal shooting of _T_r_a_y_v_o_n_ _M_a_r_t_i_n, its online coverage by
everyday Americans garnered national attention from mainstream media
journalists, in turn exemplifying _m_e_d_i_a_ _a_c_t_i_v_i_s_m. In some ways, the spread of
this tragic event through alternative news sources parallels that of the _E_m_m_i_t_t
_T_i_l_l - whose murder became a national story after it circulated African
American and Communists newspapers. Social media was also influential in the
widespread attention given to the _r_e_v_o_l_u_t_i_o_n_a_r_y_ _o_u_t_b_r_e_a_k_s_ _i_n_ _t_h_e_ _M_i_d_d_l_e_ _E_a_s_t

the extent to which social media facilitated this kind of change._[_4_6_] Another
example of this shift is in the on-going _K_o_n_y_ _2_0_1_2 campaign, which surfaced
first on YouTube and later garnered a great amount of attention from mainstream
news media journalists. These journalists now monitor social media sites to
inform their reports on the movement. Lastly, in the past couple of
presidential elections, the use of social media sites such as Facebook and
Twitter were used to predict election results. U.S. President _B_a_r_a_c_k_ _O_b_a_m_a was
more liked on Facebook than his opponent Mitt Romney and it was found by a
study done by Oxford Institute Internet Experiment that more people liked to
tweet about comments of President Obama rather than Romney._[_4_7_]

a patina of inclusiveness that covers_[_5_0_] traditional economic interests that
are structured to ensure that wealth is pumped up to the top of the economic
pyramid, perpetuating the digital divide and post Marxian class conflict. He
also voices concern over the trend that finds social utilities operating in a
quasi-_l_i_b_e_r_t_a_r_i_a_n global environment of oligopoly that requires users in
economically challenged nations to spend high percentages of annual income to
pay for devices and services to participate in the social media lifestyle.
The phrase "_D_i_g_i_t_a_l_ _d_i_v_i_d_e" was coined in 1996 by Lloyd Morrlsett, a founder of

describe the chasm that purportedly separates information technology (IT) haves
from have-nots in the US. As Virginia Eubanks explains the digital divide in
terms of social structure that have-not side users don‚Äôt have much consumer
power but the have side have the power. Money and labors go from the have-not
to have.
_N_e_i_l_ _P_o_s_t_m_a_n also contends that social media will increase an information

says, ‚ÄúTwitter only adds to the noise: it‚Äôs simply impossible to pack much
context into its 140 characters. All other biases are present as well: in a
country like Iran it‚Äôs mostly pro-Western, technology-friendly and iPod-
carrying young people who are the natural and most frequent users of Twitter.
They are a tiny and, most important, extremely untypical segment of the Iranian
population (the number of Twitter users in Iran ‚Äî a country of more than
seventy million people.)‚Äù
Even in the United States, the birth-country of Twitter, has only 107.7 million
accounts(Media Bistro, 2012) in Twitter. Since there can be many multi-account
users and there are more than 314.7 million population in U.S.(U.S. POPClock
Projection". U.S. Census Bureau., 2012), only limited groups of people use
Twitter in U.S..

Social media content is generated through social media interactions done by the
users through the site. There has always been a huge debate on the ownership of
the content on social media platforms since it is generated by the users and
hosted by the company. Added to this is the danger to security of information,
which can be leaked to third parties with economic interests in the platform,
or parasites who comb the data for their own databases._[_5_6_] The author of
Social Media Is Bullshit, _B_r_a_n_d_o_n_ _M_e_n_d_e_l_s_o_n, claims that the "true" owners of
content created on social media sites only benefits the large corporations whom
own those sites and rarely the users that created them._[_5_7_]

Privacy rights advocates warn users about uses for the information that can be
gathered through social media. Some information is captured without the user's
knowledge or consent, such as through electronic tracking and third party
application on social networks. Others include law enforcement and governmental
use of this information,_[_5_8_] including the gathering of so-called _s_o_c_i_a_l_ _m_e_d_i_a

Data suggests that participants use social media to fulfill perceived social
needs, but are typically disappointed._[_6_1_]  Lonely individuals are drawn to the
Internet for emotional support.  This causes problems as it interferes with
‚Äúreal life socializing‚Äù._[_6_2_] Some of these views are summed up in an
Atlantic article by Stephen Marche titled, "Is Facebook Making Us Lonely?"
 Marche argues that social media provides more breadth, but not the depth of
relationships that humans require.  While he makes interesting points about how
social media is replacing face-to-face interaction, he fails to cite some of
his sources._[_6_3_]
Sherry Turkle explores similar issues in her book Alone Together, as she
discusses how people confuse social media usage with authentic communication.
 People tend to act differently online and are less afraid to hurt each
other‚Äôs feelings.  Some online behaviors cause stress and anxiety, much of
this associated with friends and the permanence of online posts.  This anxiety
is also associated with the fear of being hacked or of colleges and employers
exploring social media pages and finding unsavory things posted.  Turkle also
speculates that people are beginning to prefer texting to face-to-face
communication, which can contribute to feelings of loneliness._[_6_4_]
Researchers found that only exchanges that involved direct communication and
reciprocation of messages to each other increased feelings of connectedness.
 However, passively using social media without sending or receiving messages to
individuals does not make people feel less lonely unless they were lonely to
begin with._[_6_5_]
A current controversial topic is whether or not social media addiction should
be included in the DSM-V._[_6_6_]  Extended use of social media has led to
increased Internet addiction, cyberbullying, sexting, sleep deprivation, and
the decline of face-to-face interaction._[_6_7_]  According to several clinics in
the UK, social media addiction is a certifiable medical condition.  One
psychiatric consultant claims he treats as many as one hundred cases a year.
 And as the title of this article states, "Social media addiction recognised as
official condition"._[_6_8_]

In the book ‚ÄúNetworked - The new social operating system‚Äù by Lee Rainie and
Barry Wellman, the two authors reflect on mainly positive effects of social
media and other internet based social networks. According to the authors,
social media is used to document memories, learn about and explore things,
advertise oneself and form friendships. For instance, they claim that the
communication through internet based services can be done more privately than
in real life. As a concrete example of the positive effects of social media,
they use the Egyptian revolution in 2011, where people used Facebook to gather
meetings, protest actions, etc._[_9_]

Number of US social network patent applications published and patents issued

There has been rapid growth in the number of US patent applications that cover
new technologies related to social media, and the number of them that are
published has been growing rapidly over the past five years. There are now over
2000 published patent applications._[_7_0_] As many as 7000 applications may be
currently on file including those that haven't been published yet. Only
slightly over 100 of these applications have issued as patents, however,
largely due to the multi-year backlog in examination of _b_u_s_i_n_e_s_s_ _m_e_t_h_o_d
