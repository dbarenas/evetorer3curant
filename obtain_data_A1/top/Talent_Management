TTaalleenntt mmaannaaggeemmeenntt refers to the anticipation of required human capital by an
organization and setting a plan to meet those needs._[_1_] The field increased in
popularity after McKinsey's research and subsequent book on The War for Talent.
_[_2_] Talent management in this context does not refer to the management of

Talent Management is the science of using strategic HR to improve business
value and make it possible for companies and organisations to reach their
goals. Everything that is done to recruit, retain, develop, reward and make
people perform is part of Talent Management as well as strategic workforce
planning. In short, talent management recognises and acts on the principle that
a business is only as good as its people, their ideas, their experience, the
way they do things and their attitude as they do them._[_3_] A talent management
strategy needs to be linked to the _b_u_s_i_n_e_s_s_ _s_t_r_a_t_e_g_y to make sense.

The term was coined by _M_c_K_i_n_s_e_y_ _&_ _C_o_m_p_a_n_y following a 1997 study. It was later
the title of a book by _E_d_ _M_i_c_h_a_e_l_s, _H_e_l_e_n_ _H_a_n_d_f_i_e_l_d_-_J_o_n_e_s, and _B_e_t_h_ _A_x_e_l_r_o_d
however the connection between human resource development and organizational
effectiveness has been established since the 1970s._[_4_]
The profession that supports talent management became increasingly formalized
in the early 2000s. While some authors defined the field as including nearly
everything associated with human resources,_[_5_] the NTMN defined the boundaries
of the field through _s_u_r_v_e_y_s of those in corporate talent management
departments in 2009‚Äì2011. Those surveys indicated that activities within
talent management included succession planning, assessment, development and
high potential management. Activities such as performance management and talent
acquisition (recruiting) were less frequently included in the remit of
corporate talent management practitioners. Compensation was not a function
associated with talent management.
The issue with many companies today is that their organizations put tremendous
effort into attracting employees to their company, but spend little time into
retaining and developing talent[_n_e_e_d_ _q_u_o_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _t_o_ _v_e_r_i_f_y]. A talent management
system must be worked into the business strategy and implemented in daily
processes throughout the company as a whole. It cannot be left solely to the
human resources department to attract and retain employees, but rather must be
practiced at all levels of the organization. The business strategy must include
responsibilities for line managers to develop the skills of their immediate
subordinates. Divisions within the company should be openly sharing information
with other departments in order for employees to gain knowledge of the overall
organizational objectives._[_6_]
The talent management strategy may be supported by technology such as _H_R_I_S (HR
Information Systems) or _H_R_M_S (HR Management Systems).

Talent management implies that companies are strategic and deliberate in how
they source, attract, select, train, develop, retain, promote, and move
employees through the organization.
Research done on the value of talent management consistently uncovers benefits
in these critical economic areas: revenue, customer satisfaction, quality,
productivity, cost, cycle time, and market capitalization._[_7_]_[_8_] The mindset of
this more personal human resources approach seeks not only to hire the most
qualified and valuable employees but also to put a strong emphasis on
_r_e_t_e_n_t_i_o_n.

From a talent management standpoint, employee evaluations concern two major
areas of measurement: ppeerrffoorrmmaannccee aanndd ppootteennttiiaall. Current employee performance
within a specific job has always been a standard evaluation measurement tool of
the profitability of an employee. However, talent management also seeks to
focus on an employee‚Äôs potential, meaning an employee‚Äôs future performance,
if given the proper development of skills and increased responsibility.

This term "talent management" is usually associated with _c_o_m_p_e_t_e_n_c_y_-_b_a_s_e_d
_m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t. Talent management decisions are often driven by a set of
organizational core competencies as well as position-specific competencies. The
competency set may include knowledge, skills, experience, and personal traits
(demonstrated through defined behaviors). Older _c_o_m_p_e_t_e_n_c_y_ _m_o_d_e_l_s might also
contain attributes that rarely predict success (e.g. education, tenure, and
diversity factors that are illegal to consider in relation to job performance
in many countries, and unethical within organizations). New techniques involve
creating a _c_o_m_p_e_t_e_n_c_y_ _a_r_c_h_i_t_e_c_t_u_r_e for the organization that includes a
_c_o_m_p_e_t_e_n_c_y_ _d_i_c_t_i_o_n_a_r_y to hold the competencies in order to build job
descriptions.

A talent marketplace is an employee training and development strategy that is
set in place within an organization. It is found to be most beneficial for
companies where the most productive employees can pick and choose the projects
and assignments that are ideal for the specific employee. An ideal setting is
where productivity is employee-centric and tasks are described as ‚Äújudgment-
based work,‚Äù for example, in a law firm. The point of activating a talent
marketplace within a department is to harness and link individuals‚Äô
particular skills (project management or extensive knowledge in a particular
field) with the task at hand. Examples of companies that implement the talent
marketplace strategy are American Express and IBM._[_9_]

In adverse economic conditions, many companies feel the need to cut expenses.
This should be the ideal environment to execute a talent management system as a
means of optimizing the performance of each employee and the organization.

validation help enhance the predictive power of selection tools. However,
within many companies the concept of human capital management has just begun to
develop. With more companies in the process of deepening their global
footprints, more questions have been asked about new strategies and products,
but very few on the kind of leadership structure that will bring them success
in their globalization process._[_1_0_] ‚ÄúIn fact, only 5 percent of organizations
say they have a clear talent management strategy and operational programs in
place today.‚Äù_[_1_1_]
