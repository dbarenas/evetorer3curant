Private wealth delivered to high-net-worth investors. Generally this includes
advice on the use of various estate planning vehicles, business-succession or
stock-option planning, and occasional the use of hedging _d_e_r_i_v_a_t_i_v_e_s for large
blocks of stock.
Traditionally, the wealthiest retail clients of investment firms demanded a
greater level of service, product offering and sales personnel than that
received by average clients.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] With an increase in the number of
affluent investors in recent years,_[_5_] there has been an increasing demand for
sophisticated financial solutions and expertise throughout the world.
The _C_F_A_ _I_n_s_t_i_t_u_t_e curriculum on private-wealth management indicates that two
primary factors distinguish the issues facing individual investors from those
facing institutions:
   1. Time horizons differ. Individuals face a finite life as compared to the
      theoretically/potentially infinite life of institutions. This fact
      requires strategies for transferring _a_s_s_e_t_s at the end of an individual's
      life. These transfers are subject to laws and regulations that vary from
      locality to locality and therefore the strategies available to address
      this situation vary. This is commonly known as accumulation and
      decumulation.
   2. Individuals are more likely to face a variety of taxes on investment
      returns that vary from locality to locality. Portfolio-management
      techniques that provide individuals with after _t_a_x_ _r_e_t_u_r_n_s that meet
      their objectives must address such tax structures.
The term "wealth management" occurs as at least as early as 1933._[_6_] It came
into more general use in the elite retail (or "Private Client") divisions of
firms such as _G_o_l_d_m_a_n_ _S_a_c_h_s or _M_o_r_g_a_n_ _S_t_a_n_l_e_y (before the _D_e_a_n_ _W_i_t_t_e_r_ _R_e_y_n_o_l_d_s
merger of 1997), to distinguish those divisions' services from mass-market
offerings, but since has spread throughout the financial-services industry.
Certain larger firms (_U_B_S, Morgan Stanley and _M_e_r_r_i_l_l_ _L_y_n_c_h) have "tiered"
their platforms ‚Äì with separate branch systems and advisor-training programs,
distinguishing "Private Wealth Management" from "Wealth Management", with the
latter term denoting the same type of services but with a lower degree of
customization and delivered to _m_a_s_s_ _a_f_f_l_u_e_n_t clients. At Morgan Stanley, the
"Private Wealth Management" retail division focuses on serving clients with
greater than $20 million in investment assets while "Global Wealth Management"
focuses on accounts smaller than $10 million.
In the late 1980s private banks and brokerage firms began to offer seminars and
client events designed to showcase the expertise and capabilities of the
sponsoring firm. Within a few years a new _b_u_s_i_n_e_s_s_ _m_o_d_e_l emerged ‚Äì Family
Office Exchange in 1990, the Institute for Private Investors in 1991, and CCC
Alliance in 1995. These new entities aimed to educate the ultra-wealthy
investor and to provide a network of peers for _u_l_t_r_a_-_h_i_g_h_-_n_e_t_-_w_o_r_t_h_ _i_n_d_i_v_i_d_u_a_l_s
and their families. Their growth since the 1990s indicates a market eager to
become more informed about private wealth management with total IT spending
(for example) by the global wealth management industry predicted to reach $35bn
by 2016, including heavy investment in digital channels._[_7_]
Several universities offer wealth-management education for private investors
with substantial wealth. The standards and accrediting organization the

the first such program (the CWM Chartered Wealth Manager Program), followed by
the _W_h_a_r_t_o_n_ _S_c_h_o_o_l_ _o_f_ _t_h_e_ _U_n_i_v_e_r_s_i_t_y_ _o_f_ _P_e_n_n_s_y_l_v_a_n_i_a. Since 1999 over 5000
people from over 100 countries have completed the IAFM CWM Wealth Manager
program._[_8_] At Wharton, 520 investors from 29 countries have completed a
course._[_9_] The five-day program is offered twice a year and is a continuing
partnership with the Institute for Private Investors. Both _t_h_e_ _U_n_i_v_e_r_s_i_t_y_ _o_f

_U_n_i_v_e_r_s_i_t_y offered a three day program on _v_a_l_u_e_ _i_n_v_e_s_t_i_n_g designed for high-net
investors.
Wealth management can be provided by large corporate entities, independent
financial advisers or multi-licensed portfolio managers whose services are
designed[_b_y_ _w_h_o_m_?] to focus on high-net-worth clients._[_1_0_] Large banks and
large _b_r_o_k_e_r_a_g_e houses create segmentation marketing-strategies to sell both
proprietary and non-proprietary products and services to investors designated
as potential high-net-worth clients. Independent wealth-managers use their
experience in estate planning, risk management, and their affiliations with tax
and legal specialists, to manage the diverse holdings of high-net-worth
clients. Banks and brokerage firms use advisory talent-pools to aggregate these
same services.
The events of 2008 in the financial markets caused investors to address
concerns within their portfolios. "The past 18 months have challenged
traditional thinking about investing and asset allocation, diversification, and
correlation. For individual investors, risk tolerances have been tested,
investment assumptions have been overturned, and fundamental truisms have been
questioned."_[_1_1_] For this reason wealth managers must be prepared to respond to
a greater need by clients to understand, access, and communicate with advisers
regarding their current relationship as well as the products and services that
may satisfy future needs.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] Moreover, advisors must have
sufficient information, from objective sources, regarding all products and
services owned by their clients to answer enquiries regarding performance and
degree of risk - at the client, portfolio and individual-security levels. "This
state of affairs poses a dilemma for wealth managers, who, for a generation,
have adhered to the core principles of asset allocation and earned their keep
by preaching the mantras of '_b_u_y_ _a_n_d_ _h_o_l_d', 'invest for the long term', and
when things get tough, 'stay the course'.‚Äù_[_1_2_]
As of 2013_[_u_p_d_a_t_e_] wealth-management advisors must have access to an objective
content repository.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] This repository must contain a current and
readily available profile of the clients' holdings.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]

The 2013 World Wealth Report, released in June 2013, showed that despite the
turbulence of the global economy, particularly in the Eurozone, both the
population and wealth of global HNWIs reached significant new highs in 2012.
Even though the year got off to a shaky start, HNWIs ultimately benefitted from
strong market returns in spite of sluggish global GDP growth._[_1_6_] The report
was widely welcomed as good news for the private wealth management sector.
The 2013 edition of the World Wealth Report also included the inuagural
Capgemini, RBC Wealth Management and _S_c_o_r_p_i_o_ _P_a_r_t_n_e_r_s_h_i_p Global HNW Insights
Survey. The survey represents one of the largest and most in-depth surveys of
high net worth individuals ever conducted, surveying more than 4,400 HNWIs
across 21 major wealth markets.
This survey-driven section of the report aimed to provide perspectives from the
world's wealthy. Key findings included:
    * In Q1, 2013, around 61% of HNWIs said they have trust and confidence in
      their wealth managers and firms, an increase of roughly four and three
      percentage points respectively, from 2012._[_1_7_]
    * 75.4% of HNWIs around the globe cited confidence in their ability to
      generate wealth over the next year._[_1_8_]
    * 52.6% of HNWIs gave their advisors and support staff a strong performance
