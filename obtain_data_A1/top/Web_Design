WWeebb ddeessiiggnn encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production
and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design include web
graphic design; _i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e_ _d_e_s_i_g_n; authoring, including standardised code and
proprietary software; _u_s_e_r_ _e_x_p_e_r_i_e_n_c_e_ _d_e_s_i_g_n; and _s_e_a_r_c_h_ _e_n_g_i_n_e_ _o_p_t_i_m_i_z_a_t_i_o_n.
Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the
design process, although some designers will cover them all._[_1_] The term web
design is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-
end (client side) design of a website including writing mark up. Web design
partially overlaps _w_e_b_ _e_n_g_i_n_e_e_r_i_n_g in the broader scope of _w_e_b_ _d_e_v_e_l_o_p_m_e_n_t. Web
designers are expected to have an awareness of _u_s_a_b_i_l_i_t_y and if their role
involves creating mark up then they are also expected to be up to date with _w_e_b
_a_c_c_e_s_s_i_b_i_l_i_t_y guidelines.

Although web design has a fairly recent history, it can be linked to other
areas such as graphic design. However web design is also seen as a
technological standpoint. It has become a large part of people‚Äôs everyday
lives. It is hard to imagine the Internet without animated graphics, different
styles of typography, background and music.

In 1989, whilst working at _C_E_R_N _T_i_m_ _B_e_r_n_e_r_s_-_L_e_e proposed to create a global
hypertext project, which later became known as the _W_o_r_l_d_ _W_i_d_e_ _W_e_b. Throughout
1991 to 1993 the World Wide Web was born. Text only pages could be viewed using
a simple line-mode browser._[_2_] In 1993 _M_a_r_c_ _A_n_d_r_e_e_s_s_e_n and _E_r_i_c_ _B_i_n_a, created
the _M_o_s_a_i_c_ _b_r_o_w_s_e_r. At the time there were multiple browsers however the
majority of them were Unix-based and were naturally text heavy. There had been
no integrated approach to graphical design elements such as images or sounds.
The Mosaic browser broke this mould._[_3_] The _W_3_C was created in October 1994, to
"lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing common protocols
that promote its evolution and ensure its interoperability."_[_4_] This
discouraged any one company from monopolizing a propriety browser and
programming language, which could have altered the effect of the World Wide Web
as a whole. The W3C continues to set standards, which can today be seen with
JavaScript. In 1994 Andreessen formed Communications corp. That later became
known as _N_e_t_s_c_a_p_e_ _C_o_m_m_u_n_i_c_a_t_i_o_n_s the Netscape 0.9 browser. Netscape created its
own HTML tags without regards to the traditional standards process. For example
Netscape 1.1 included tags for changing background colours and formatting text
with tables on web pages. Throughout 1996 to 1999 the _b_r_o_w_s_e_r_ _w_a_r_s began. The
browser wars saw _M_i_c_r_o_s_o_f_t and _N_e_t_s_c_a_p_e battle it out for the ultimate browser
dominance. During this time there were many new technologies in the field,
notably _C_a_s_c_a_d_i_n_g_ _S_t_y_l_e_ _S_h_e_e_t_s, _J_a_v_a_S_c_r_i_p_t, and _D_y_n_a_m_i_c_ _H_T_M_L. On a whole the
browser competition did lead to many positive creations and helped web design
evolve at a rapid pace._[_5_]

In 1996, Microsoft released its first competitive browser, which was complete
with its own features and tags. It was also the first browser to support style
sheets, which at the time was seen as an obscure authoring technique._[_5_] The
_H_T_M_L_ _m_a_r_k_u_p for _t_a_b_l_e_s was originally intended for displaying tabular data.
However designers quickly realized the potential of using HTML tables for
creating the complex, multi-column layouts that were otherwise not possible. At
this time, as design and good aesthetics seemed to take precedence over good
mark-up structure, and little attention was paid to semantics and _w_e_b
_a_c_c_e_s_s_i_b_i_l_i_t_y. HTML sites were limited in their design options, even more so
with earlier versions of HTML. To create complex designs, many web designers
had to use complicated table structures or even use blank _s_p_a_c_e_r_ _._G_I_F images to
stop empty table cells from collapsing._[_6_] _C_S_S was introduced in December 1996
by the _W_3_C to support presentation and layout; this allowed _H_T_M_L code to be
semantic rather than both semantic and presentational, and improved web
accessibility, see _t_a_b_l_e_l_e_s_s_ _w_e_b_ _d_e_s_i_g_n.
In 1996, _F_l_a_s_h (originally known as FutureSplash) was developed. At the time,
the Flash content development tool was relatively simple compared to now, using
basic layout and drawing tools, a limited precursor to _A_c_t_i_o_n_S_c_r_i_p_t, and a
timeline, but it enabled web designers to go beyond the point of HTML, _a_n_i_m_a_t_e_d
_G_I_F_s and _J_a_v_a_S_c_r_i_p_t. However, because Flash required a _p_l_u_g_-_i_n, many web
developers avoided using it for fear of limiting their market share from lack
of compatibility. Instead, designers reverted to gif animations (if they didn't
forego using _m_o_t_i_o_n_ _g_r_a_p_h_i_c_s altogether) and JavaScript for _w_i_d_g_e_t_s. But the
benefits of Flash made it popular enough among specific target markets to
eventually work its way to the vast majority of browsers, and powerful enough
to be used to develop entire sites._[_6_]

During 1998 Netscape released Netscape Communicator code under an _o_p_e_n_ _s_o_u_r_c_e
_l_i_c_e_n_c_e, enabling thousands of developers to participate in improving the
software. However, they decided to stop and start from the beginning, which
guided the development of the open source browser and soon expanded to a
complete application platform._[_5_] The _W_e_b_ _S_t_a_n_d_a_r_d_s_ _P_r_o_j_e_c_t was formed, and
promoted browser compliance with _H_T_M_L and _C_S_S standards by creating _A_c_i_d_1,
_A_c_i_d_2, and _A_c_i_d_3 tests. 2000 was a big year for Microsoft. Internet Explorer
had been released for Mac, this was significant as it was the first browser
that fully supported HTML 4.01 and CSS 1, raising the bar in terms of standards
compliance. It was also the first browser to fully support the _P_N_G image
format._[_5_] During this time Netscape was sold to _A_O_L and this was seen as
Netscape‚Äôs official loss to Microsoft in the browser wars._[_5_]

Since the start of the 21st century the web has become more and more integrated
into peoples lives, as this has happened the technology of the web has also
moved on. There have also been significant changes in the way people use and
access the web, and this has changed how sites are designed.

Since the end of the browsers wars there have been new browsers coming onto the
scene. Many of these are _o_p_e_n_ _s_o_u_r_c_e meaning that they tend to have faster
development and are more supportive of new standards. The new options are
considered by many to be better that Microsoft's _I_n_t_e_r_n_e_t_ _E_x_p_l_o_r_e_r.

The _W_3_C has released new standards of HTML (_H_T_M_L_5) and CSS (_C_S_S_3), as well as
new _J_a_v_a_S_c_r_i_p_t _A_P_I_'_s each as a new but individual standard. However, while the
term HTML5 is only used to refer to the new version of HTML and some of the
JavaScript API's, it has become common to use it to refer to the entire suite
of new standards (HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript)

Web designers use a variety of different tools depending on what part of the
production process they are involved in. These tools are updated over time by
newer standards and software but the principles behind them remain the same.
Web graphic designers use vector and raster graphics packages for creating web
formatted imagery or design prototypes. Technologies used for creating websites
include standardised mark-up, which could be hand-coded or generated by _W_Y_S_I_W_Y_G
_e_d_i_t_i_n_g_ _s_o_f_t_w_a_r_e. There is also proprietary software based on plug-ins that
bypasses the client‚Äôs browsers versions. These are often WYSIWYG but with the
option of using the software‚Äôs scripting language. _S_e_a_r_c_h_ _e_n_g_i_n_e_ _o_p_t_i_m_i_s_a_t_i_o_n
tools may be used to check search engine ranking and suggest improvements.
Other tools web designers might use include mark up _v_a_l_i_d_a_t_o_r_s_[_7_] and other
testing tools for usability and accessibility to ensure their web sites meet
web accessibility guidelines._[_8_]

Marketing and communication design on a website may identify what works for its
target market. This can be an age group or particular strand of culture; thus
the designer may understand the trends of its audience. Designers may also
understand the type of website they are designing, meaning, for example, that
(B2B) _b_u_s_i_n_e_s_s_-_t_o_-_b_u_s_i_n_e_s_s website design considerations might differ greatly
from a consumer targeted website such as a _r_e_t_a_i_l or entertainment website.
Careful consideration might be made to ensure that the aesthetics or overall
design of a site do not clash with the clarity and accuracy of the content or
the ease of _w_e_b_ _n_a_v_i_g_a_t_i_o_n, _[_9_] especially on a B2B website. Designers may also
consider the reputation of the owner or business the site is representing to
make sure they are portrayed favourably.

Users understanding the content of a website often depends on users
understanding how the website works. This is part of the _u_s_e_r_ _e_x_p_e_r_i_e_n_c_e
_d_e_s_i_g_n. User experience is related to layout, clear instructions and labeling
on a website. How well a user understands how they can interact on a site may
also depend on the _i_n_t_e_r_a_c_t_i_v_e_ _d_e_s_i_g_n of the site. If a user perceives the
usefulness of that website, they are more likely to continue using it. Users
who are skilled and well versed with website use may find a more unique, yet
less intuitive or less _u_s_e_r_-_f_r_i_e_n_d_l_y website interface useful nonetheless.
However, users with less experience are less likely to see the advantages or
usefulness of a less intuitive website interface. This drives the trend for a
more universal user experience and ease of access to accommodate as many users
as possible regardless of user skill._[_1_0_] Much of the user experience design
and interactive design are considered in the _u_s_e_r_ _i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e_ _d_e_s_i_g_n.
Advanced interactive functions may require _p_l_u_g_-_i_n_s if not advanced coding
language skills. Choosing whether or not to use interactivity that requires
plug-ins is a critical decision in user experience design. If the plug-in
doesn't come pre-installed with most browsers, there's a risk that the user
will have neither the know how, nor the patience to install a plug-in just to
access the content. If the function requires advanced coding language skills,
it may be too costly in either time or money to code compared to the amount of
enhancement the function will add to the user experience. There's also a risk
that advanced interactivity may be incompatible with older browsers or hardware
configurations. Publishing a function that doesn't work reliably is potentially
worse for the user experience than making no attempt. It depends on the target
audience if it's likely to be needed or worth any risks.

Part of the user interface design is affected by the quality of the _p_a_g_e
_l_a_y_o_u_t. For example, a designer may consider if the sites page layout should
remain consistent on different pages when designing the layout. Page pixel
width may also be considered vital for aligning objects in the layout design.
The most popular fixed-width websites generally have the same set width to
match the current most popular browser window, at the current most popular
screen resolution, on the current most popular monitor size. Most pages are
also center-aligned for concerns of _a_e_s_t_h_e_t_i_c_s on larger screens._[_1_1_]
Fluid layouts increased in popularity around 2000 as an alternative to HTML-
table-based layouts and _g_r_i_d_-_b_a_s_e_d_ _d_e_s_i_g_n in both page layout design principle,
and in coding technique, but were very slow to be adopted._[_n_o_t_e_ _1_] This was due
to considerations of _s_c_r_e_e_n_ _r_e_a_d_i_n_g_ _d_e_v_i_c_e_s and windows varying in sizes which
designers have no control over. Accordingly, a design may be broken down into
units (sidebars, content blocks, _e_m_b_e_d_d_e_d_ _a_d_v_e_r_t_i_s_i_n_g areas, navigation areas)
that are sent to the browser and which will be fitted into the display window
by the browser, as best it can. As the browser does recognize the details of
the reader's screen (window size, font size relative to window etc.) the
browser can make user-specific layout adjustments to fluid layouts, but not
fixed-width layouts. Although such a display may often change the relative
position of major content units, sidebars may be displaced below _b_o_d_y_ _t_e_x_t
rather than to the side of it. This is a more flexible display than a hard-
coded grid-based layout that doesn't fit the device window. In particular, the
relative position of content blocks may change while leaving the content within
the block unaffected. This also minimizes the user's need to horizontally
scroll the page.
_R_e_s_p_o_n_s_i_v_e_ _W_e_b_ _D_e_s_i_g_n is a newer approach, based on CSS3, and a deeper level of
per-device specification within the page's stylesheet through an enhanced use
of the CSS @media pseudo-selector.

Web designers may choose to limit the variety of website typefaces to only a
few which are of a similar style, instead of using a wide range of _t_y_p_e_f_a_c_e_s or
_t_y_p_e_ _s_t_y_l_e_s. Most browsers recognize a specific number of safe fonts, which
designers mainly use in order to avoid complications.
Font downloading was later included in the CSS3 fonts module and has since been
implemented in Safari 3.1, Opera 10 and Mozilla Firefox 3.5. This has
subsequently increased interest in _w_e_b_ _t_y_p_o_g_r_a_p_h_y, as well as the usage of font
downloading.
Most layouts on a site incorporate negative space to break the text up into
paragraphs and also avoid center-aligned text. _[_1_2_]

The page layout and user interface may also be affected by the use of motion
graphics. The choice of whether or not to use motion graphics may depend on the
target market for the website. Motion graphics may be expected or at least
better received with an entertainment-oriented website. However, a website
target audience with a more serious or formal interest (such as business,
community, or government) might find animations unnecessary and distracting if
only for entertainment or decoration purposes. This doesn't mean that more
serious content couldn't be enhanced with animated or video presentations that
is relevant to the content. In either case, _m_o_t_i_o_n_ _g_r_a_p_h_i_c_ _d_e_s_i_g_n may make the
difference between more effective visuals or distracting visuals.

Website designers may consider it to be good practice to conform to standards.
This is usually done via a description specifying what the element is doing.
Failure to conform to standards may not make a website unusable or error prone,
but standards can relate to the correct layout of pages for readability as well
making sure coded elements are closed appropriately. This includes errors in
code, more organized layout for code, and making sure IDs and classes are
identified properly. Poorly-coded pages are sometimes colloquially called _t_a_g
_s_o_u_p. _V_a_l_i_d_a_t_i_n_g_ _v_i_a_ _W_3_C_[_7_] can only be done when a correct DOCTYPE declaration
is made, which is used to highlight errors in code. The system identifies the
errors and areas that do not conform to web design standards. This information
can then be corrected by the user._[_1_3_]

There are two primary jobs involved in creating a website: the web designer and
_w_e_b_ _d_e_v_e_l_o_p_e_r, who often work closely together on a website._[_1_4_] The web
designers are responsible for the visual aspect, which includes the layout,
coloring and typography of a web page. Web designers will also have a working
knowledge of using a variety of languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP
and Flash to create a site, although the extent of their knowledge will differ
from one web designer to another. Particularly in smaller organizations one
person will need the necessary skills for designing and programming the full
web page, while larger organizations may have a web designer responsible for
the visual aspect alone._[_1_5_]
Further jobs, which under particular circumstances may become involved during
the creation of a website include:
    * _G_r_a_p_h_i_c_ _d_e_s_i_g_n_e_r_s to create visuals for the site such as logos, layouts
      and buttons
    * Internet marketing specialists to help maintain web presence through
      strategic solutions on targeting viewers to the site, by using marketing
      and promotional techniques on the internet
    * SEO writers to research and recommend the correct words to be
      incorporated into a particular website and make the website more
      accessible and found on numerous search engines
    * Internet copywriter to create the written content of the page to appeal
      to the targeted viewers of the site_[_1_]
    * User experience (UX) designer incorporates aspects of user focused design
      considerations which include information architecture, user centered
      design, user testing, interaction design, and occasionally visual design.
