CCoommppeettiittiioonn in _b_i_o_l_o_g_y, _e_c_o_l_o_g_y, and _s_o_c_i_o_l_o_g_y, is a _c_o_n_t_e_s_t between organisms,
animals, individuals, groups, etc., for _t_e_r_r_i_t_o_r_y, a niche, or a location of
_r_e_s_o_u_r_c_e_s, for resources and goods, mates, for _p_r_e_s_t_i_g_e, _r_e_c_o_g_n_i_t_i_o_n, _a_w_a_r_d_s,
or group or social status, for leadership. Competition is the opposite of
_c_o_o_p_e_r_a_t_i_o_n._[_1_]_[_2_] It arises whenever at least two parties strive for a goal
which cannot be shared or which is desired individually but not in sharing and
cooperation. Competition occurs _n_a_t_u_r_a_l_l_y between living organisms which co-
exist in the same _e_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t._[_3_] For example, animals compete over water
supplies, food, mates, and other _b_i_o_l_o_g_i_c_a_l_ _r_e_s_o_u_r_c_e_s. Humans compete usually
for food and mates, though when these needs are met deep rivalries often arise
over the pursuit of _w_e_a_l_t_h, prestige, and _f_a_m_e. Competition is also a major
tenet in _m_a_r_k_e_t_ _e_c_o_n_o_m_y and business is often associated with competition as
most companies are in competition with at least one other firm over the same
group of customers, and also competition inside a company is usually stimulated
for meeting and reaching higher quality of services or products that the
company produce or develop.

Competition can have both beneficial and detrimental effects. Many evolutionary
biologists view inter-species and intra-species competition as the driving
force of _a_d_a_p_t_a_t_i_o_n, and ultimately of _e_v_o_l_u_t_i_o_n. However, some biologists,
most famously _R_i_c_h_a_r_d_ _D_a_w_k_i_n_s, prefer to think of evolution in terms of
competition between single genes, which have the welfare of the organism 'in
mind' only insofar as that welfare furthers their own selfish drives for
replication. Some _s_o_c_i_a_l_ _d_a_r_w_i_n_i_s_t_s claim that competition also serves as a
mechanism for determining the best-suited group; politically, economically and
ecologically. Positively, competition may serve as a form of _r_e_c_r_e_a_t_i_o_n or a
challenge provided that it is non-hostile. On the negative side, competition
can cause injury and loss to the organisms involved, and drain valuable
resources and energy. In the human species competition can be expensive on many
levels, not only in lives lost to war, physical injuries, and damaged
psychological well beings, but also in the health effects from everyday
civilian life caused by work stress, long work hours, abusive working
relationships, and poor working conditions, that detract from the enjoyment of
life, even as such competition results in financial gain for the owners.

Competition within, between, and among species is one of the most important
forces in biology, especially in the field of _e_c_o_l_o_g_y._[_3_] Competition between
members of a species ("intraspecific") for resources such as _f_o_o_d, _w_a_t_e_r,
_t_e_r_r_i_t_o_r_y, and _s_u_n_l_i_g_h_t may result in an increase in the frequency of a variant
of the species best suited for survival and reproduction until its fixation
within a population. Competition is also present between species
("interspecific"). When resources are limited, several species may depend on
these resources. Thus, each of the species competes with the others to gain
access to the resources. As a result, species less suited to compete for the
resources may _d_i_e_ _o_u_t unless they _a_d_a_p_t by character dislocation, for instance.
According to _e_v_o_l_u_t_i_o_n_a_r_y_ _t_h_e_o_r_y, this competition within and between species
for resources plays a significant role in _n_a_t_u_r_a_l_ _s_e_l_e_c_t_i_o_n. At shorter time
scales, competition is also one of the most important factors controlling
diversity in ecological communities, particularly in plant communities where
asymmetric competition and competitive dominance frequently occur._[_3_]

Merriam-Webster defines competition in business as "the effort of two or more
parties acting independently to secure the business of a third party by
offering the most favorable terms"._[_4_] It was described by _A_d_a_m_ _S_m_i_t_h in _T_h_e
_W_e_a_l_t_h_ _o_f_ _N_a_t_i_o_n_s (1776) and later economists as allocating productive
_r_e_s_o_u_r_c_e_s to their most highly-valued uses._[_5_] and encouraging _e_f_f_i_c_i_e_n_c_y.
Later _m_i_c_r_o_e_c_o_n_o_m_i_c_ _t_h_e_o_r_y distinguished between _p_e_r_f_e_c_t_ _c_o_m_p_e_t_i_t_i_o_n and
_i_m_p_e_r_f_e_c_t_ _c_o_m_p_e_t_i_t_i_o_n, concluding that no system of resource allocation is more
efficient than _p_e_r_f_e_c_t_ _c_o_m_p_e_t_i_t_i_o_n. Competition, according to the theory,
causes commercial firms to develop new products, services and technologies,
which would give consumers greater selection and better products. The greater
selection typically causes lower prices for the products, compared to what the
price would be if there was no competition (_m_o_n_o_p_o_l_y) or little competition
(_o_l_i_g_o_p_o_l_y).
However, competition may also lead to wasted (duplicated) effort and to
increased _c_o_s_t_s (and prices) in some circumstances. For example, the intense
competition for the small number of _t_o_p_ _j_o_b_s_ _i_n_ _m_u_s_i_c_ _a_n_d_ _m_o_v_i_e_ _a_c_t_i_n_g leads
many aspiring musicians and actors to make substantial investments in training
which are not recouped, because only a fraction become successful. Critics have
also argued that competition can be destabilizing, particularly competition
between certain financial institutions._[_6_]
Experts have also questioned the constructiveness of competition in
profitability. It has been argued that competition-oriented objectives are
counterproductive to raising revenues and profitability because they limit the
options of strategies for firms as well as their ability to offer innovative
responses to changes in the market._[_7_] In addition, the strong desire to defeat
rival firms with competitive prices has the strong possibility of causing price
wars._[_8_]
Three levels of economic competition have been classified:
    * The most narrow form is ddiirreecctt ccoommppeettiittiioonn (also called category
      competition or brand competition), where _p_r_o_d_u_c_t_s which perform the same
      function compete against each other. For example, one brand of pick-up
      trucks competes with several other brands of pick-up trucks. Sometimes,
      two companies are rivals and one adds new products to their line, which
      leads to the other company distributing the same new things, and in this
      manner they compete.
    * The next form is ssuubbssttiittuuttee or iinnddiirreecctt ccoommppeettiittiioonn, where products which
      are close substitutes for one another compete. For example, butter
      competes with margarine, mayonnaise and other various sauces and spreads.
    * The broadest form of competition is typically called bbuuddggeett ccoommppeettiittiioonn.
      Included in this category is anything on which the _c_o_n_s_u_m_e_r might want to
      spend their available _m_o_n_e_y. For example, a family which has $20,000
      available may choose to spend it on many different items, which can all
      be seen as competing with each other for the family's expenditure. This
      form of competition is also sometimes described as a competition of
      "share of wallet".
In addition, companies also compete for _f_i_n_a_n_c_i_n_g on the capital markets
(equity or debt) in order to generate the necessary cash for their operations.
An _i_n_v_e_s_t_o_r typically will consider alternative investment opportunities given
his risk profile and not only look at companies just competing on product
(ddiirreecctt ccoommppeettiittoorrss). Enlarging the investment universe to include iinnddiirreecctt
ccoommppeettiittoorrss leads to a broader _p_e_e_r_ _u_n_i_v_e_r_s_e of comparable, indirectly
competing companies.
Competition does not necessarily have to be between companies. For example,
business writers sometimes refer to iinntteerrnnaall ccoommppeettiittiioonn. This is competition
within companies. The idea was first introduced by _A_l_f_r_e_d_ _S_l_o_a_n at _G_e_n_e_r_a_l
_M_o_t_o_r_s in the 1920s. Sloan deliberately created areas of overlap between
divisions of the company so that each division would be competing with the
other divisions. For example, the _C_h_e_v_y division would compete with the _P_o_n_t_i_a_c
division for some _m_a_r_k_e_t_ _s_e_g_m_e_n_t_s. The competing brands by the same company
allowed parts to be designed by one division and shared by several divisions,
for example parts designed by Chevy would also be used by Pontiac. Also, in
1931, _P_r_o_c_t_e_r_ _&_ _G_a_m_b_l_e initiated a deliberate system of internal brand-versus-
brand rivalry. The company was organized around different _b_r_a_n_d_s, with each
brand allocated resources, including a dedicated group of employees willing to
champion the brand. Each brand manager was given responsibility for the success
or failure of the brand, and compensated accordingly. This is known as iinnttrraa--
bbrraanndd ccoommppeettiittiioonn.
Finally, most businesses also encourage competition between individual
employees. An example of this is a contest between sales representatives. The
sales representative with the highest sales (or the best improvement in sales)
over a period of time would gain benefits from the employer.
Shalev and Asbjornsen also found that success (i.e. the saving resulted) of
_r_e_v_e_r_s_e_ _a_u_c_t_i_o_n_s correlated most closely with competition. The literature
widely supported the importance of competition as the primary driver of reverse
auctions success._[_9_] Their findings appear to support that argument, as
competition correlated strongly with the reverse auction success, as well as
with the number of bidders._[_1_0_]
It should also be noted that business and economic competition in most
_c_o_u_n_t_r_i_e_s is often limited or restricted. Competition often is subject to legal
restrictions. For example, competition may be legally prohibited, as in the
case with a _g_o_v_e_r_n_m_e_n_t_ _m_o_n_o_p_o_l_y or a _g_o_v_e_r_n_m_e_n_t_-_g_r_a_n_t_e_d_ _m_o_n_o_p_o_l_y. _T_a_r_i_f_f_s,
_s_u_b_s_i_d_i_e_s or other _p_r_o_t_e_c_t_i_o_n_i_s_t measures may also be instituted by government
in order to prevent or reduce competition. Depending on the respective economic
policy, pure competition is to a greater or lesser extent regulated by
_c_o_m_p_e_t_i_t_i_o_n_ _p_o_l_i_c_y and _c_o_m_p_e_t_i_t_i_o_n_ _l_a_w. Another component of these activities
is the discovery process, with instances of higher _g_o_v_e_r_n_m_e_n_t_ _r_e_g_u_l_a_t_i_o_n_s
typically leading to less competitive businesses being launched._[_1_1_]

Competition between countries is quite subtle to detect, but is quite evident
in the _w_o_r_l_d_ _e_c_o_n_o_m_y. Countries compete to provide the best possible business
environment for _m_u_l_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _c_o_r_p_o_r_a_t_i_o_n_s. Such competition is evident by the
policies undertaken by these countries to educate the future workforce. For
example, East Asian economies such as Singapore, Japan and South Korea tend to
emphasize education by allocating a large portion of the budget to this sector,
and by implementing programmes such as _g_i_f_t_e_d_ _e_d_u_c_a_t_i_o_n.

influential _a_n_t_i_t_r_u_s_t enforcers of U.S. competition laws
Competition _l_a_w, known in the _U_n_i_t_e_d_ _S_t_a_t_e_s as antitrust law, has three main
functions. First it prohibits agreements aimed to restrict free trading between
business entities and their customers. For example, a _c_a_r_t_e_l of sports shops
who together fix football jersey prices higher than normal is illegal._[_1_2_]
Second competition law can ban the existence or abusive behaviour of a firm
dominating the market. One case in point could be a software company who
through its _m_o_n_o_p_o_l_y on computer platforms makes consumers use its media
player._[_1_3_] Third to preserve competitive markets, the law supervises the

could for instance require that a large packaging company give plastic bottle
_l_i_c_e_n_s_e_s to competitors before taking over a major _P_E_T producer._[_1_4_] In this
case (as in all three), competition law aims to protect the _w_e_l_f_a_r_e_ _o_f
_c_o_n_s_u_m_e_r_s by ensuring business must compete for its share of the _m_a_r_k_e_t
_e_c_o_n_o_m_y.
In recent decades, competition law has also been sold as good medicine to
provide better _p_u_b_l_i_c_ _s_e_r_v_i_c_e_s, traditionally funded by _t_a_x payers and

is closely connected with the law on deregulation of access to markets,
providing state aids and subsidies, the _p_r_i_v_a_t_i_s_a_t_i_o_n of state-owned assets and
the use of independent sector regulators, such as the United Kingdom
telecommunications watchdog _O_f_c_o_m. Behind the practice lies the theory, which
over the last fifty years has been dominated by _n_e_o_-_c_l_a_s_s_i_c_a_l_ _e_c_o_n_o_m_i_c_s.
Markets are seen as the most efficient method of allocating resources, although
sometimes _t_h_e_y_ _f_a_i_l, and regulation becomes necessary to protect the ideal
market model. Behind the theory lies the history, reaching back further than
the _R_o_m_a_n_ _E_m_p_i_r_e. The business practices of market traders, _g_u_i_l_d_s and
governments have always been subject to scrutiny and sometimes severe
sanctions. Since the twentieth century, competition law has become global. The
two largest, most organised and influential systems of competition regulation
are _U_n_i_t_e_d_ _S_t_a_t_e_s_ _a_n_t_i_t_r_u_s_t_ _l_a_w and _E_u_r_o_p_e_a_n_ _C_o_m_m_u_n_i_t_y_ _c_o_m_p_e_t_i_t_i_o_n_ _l_a_w. The

Competition is also found in _p_o_l_i_t_i_c_s. In _d_e_m_o_c_r_a_c_i_e_s, an _e_l_e_c_t_i_o_n is a
competition for an elected office. In other words, two or more candidates
strive and compete against one another to attain a position of power. The
winner gains the seat of the elected office for a predefined period of time,
towards the end of which another election is usually held to determine the next
holder of the office.
In addition, there is inevitable competition inside a government. Because
several offices are appointed, potential candidates compete against the others
in order to gain the particular office. Departments may also compete for a
limited amount of resources, such as for _f_u_n_d_i_n_g. Finally, where there are
_p_a_r_t_y_ _s_y_s_t_e_m_s, elected leaders of different parties will ultimately compete
against the other parties for _l_a_w_s, _f_u_n_d_i_n_g and _p_o_w_e_r.
Finally, competition also exists between _g_o_v_e_r_n_m_e_n_t_s. Each _c_o_u_n_t_r_y or
_n_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_i_t_y struggles for world dominance, power, or _m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y strength. For
example, the _U_n_i_t_e_d_ _S_t_a_t_e_s competed against the _S_o_v_i_e_t_ _U_n_i_o_n in the _C_o_l_d_ _W_a_r
for world power, and the two also struggled over the different types of
government (in these cases _r_e_p_r_e_s_e_n_t_a_t_i_v_e_ _d_e_m_o_c_r_a_c_y and _c_o_m_m_u_n_i_s_m). The result
of this type of competition often leads to worldwide tensions, and may
sometimes erupt into _w_a_r_f_a_r_e.

While some _s_p_o_r_t_s (such as _f_i_s_h_i_n_g or _h_i_k_i_n_g) have been viewed as primarily
recreational, most sports are considered competitive. The majority involve
competition between two or more persons (sometimes using _h_o_r_s_e_s or _c_a_r_s). For
example, in a game of _b_a_s_k_e_t_b_a_l_l, two teams compete against one another to
determine who can score the most points. When there is no set reward for the
winning team, many players gain a sense of _p_r_i_d_e. In addition, extrinsic
rewards may also be given. Athletes, besides competing against other humans,
also compete against _n_a_t_u_r_e in sports such as _w_h_i_t_e_w_a_t_e_r_ _k_a_y_a_k_i_n_g or
_m_o_u_n_t_a_i_n_e_e_r_i_n_g, where the goal is to reach a destination, with only natural
barriers impeding the process. A regularly scheduled (for instance annual)
competition meant to determine the "best" competitor of that cycle is called a
_c_h_a_m_p_i_o_n_s_h_i_p.
_B_a_s_e_b_a_l_l, a competitive sport
Professional sports, as well as the business of it, are intense and extremely
competitive, while recreational sports are often less intense and found
enjoyable by many, as well as cathartic. Yet psychological evidence has been
found that the more aggressive sports result in increased aggressive behavior
when the sport is not being played. For those attaining winning status,
endorphins are released, often driving them, and in extreme cases, addicting
them to increased levels of competition, dedication, and enjoyment of the
sport. In the case of sports viewers, participating artificially, similar
evidence was found. Mostly in professional sports rivals, there may be half of
the home team's fans and half of the visiting team's fans vice versa during the
rivalry games.
Competitive sports are governed by codified rules agreed upon by the
participants. Violating these rules is considered to be unfair competition.
Thus, sports provide artificial (not natural) competition; for example,
competing for control of a ball, or defending territory on a playing field is
not an innate biological factor in humans. Athletes in sports such as
_g_y_m_n_a_s_t_i_c_s and competitive _d_i_v_i_n_g compete against each other in order to come
closest to a conceptual ideal of a perfect performance, which incorporates
measurable criteria and standards which are translated into numerical ratings
and scores by appointed judges.
Sports competition is generally broken down into three categories: iinnddiivviidduuaall
sports, such as _a_r_c_h_e_r_y; dduuaall sports, such as _d_o_u_b_l_e_s_ _t_e_n_n_i_s, and tteeaamm sports
competition, such as _c_r_i_c_k_e_t or _f_o_o_t_b_a_l_l. While most sports competitions are
recreation, there exist several _m_a_j_o_r and _m_i_n_o_r professional sports leagues
throughout the world. The _O_l_y_m_p_i_c_ _G_a_m_e_s, held every four years, is usually
regarded as the international pinnacle of sports competition.

Competition is a major factor in education. On a global scale, national
education systems, intending to bring out the best in the next generation,
encourage competitiveness among students through _s_c_h_o_l_a_r_s_h_i_p_s. Countries such
as England and Singapore have _s_p_e_c_i_a_l_ _e_d_u_c_a_t_i_o_n programmes which cater for
specialist students, prompting charges of _a_c_a_d_e_m_i_c_ _e_l_i_t_i_s_m. Upon receipt of
their academic results, students tend to compare their grades to see who is
better. In severe cases, the pressure to perform in some countries is so high
that it can result in stigmatization of intellectually deficient students, or
even suicide as a consequence of failing the exams; Japan being a prime example
(see _E_d_u_c_a_t_i_o_n_ _i_n_ _J_a_p_a_n). This has resulted in critical re-evaluation of
examinations as a whole by educationalists[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]. Critics of
competition as a motivating factor in education systems, such as _A_l_f_i_e_ _K_o_h_n,
assert that competition actually has a net negative influence on the
achievement levels of students, and that it "turns all of us into losers" (Kohn
1986). Economist _R_i_c_h_a_r_d_ _L_a_y_a_r_d has commented on the harmful effects, stating
"people feel that they are under a great deal of pressure. They feel that their
main objective in life is to do better than other people. That is certainly
what young people are being taught in school every day. And it's not a good
basis for a society."_[_1_5_]

In Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, competitions or lottos are
the equivalent of what are commonly known as _s_w_e_e_p_s_t_a_k_e_s in the United States.
The correct technical name for Australian consumer competitions is a trade
promotion lottery or lottos. _[_1_6_]
Competition or trade promotion lottery entrants enter to win a prize or prizes,
hence many entrants are all in competition, or competing for a limited number
of prizes.
A trade promotion lottery or competition is a free entry lottery run to promote
goods or services supplied by a business. An example is where you purchase
goods or services and then given the chance to enter into the lottery and
possibly win a prize. A trade promotion lottery can be called a lotto,
competition, contest, sweepstake, or giveaway.
People that enjoy entering competitions are known as compers. Many compers
attend annual national conventions. In 2012 over 100 people from around
Australia met on the Gold Coast, Queensland to discuss competitions._[_1_7_]_[_1_8_]

emerges and what its effects are. _S_o_c_i_o_l_o_g_i_s_t_s, meanwhile, study the effects of

Main article: _C_o_m_p_e_t_i_t_i_v_e_n_e_s_s
Many _p_h_i_l_o_s_o_p_h_e_r_s and _p_s_y_c_h_o_l_o_g_i_s_t_s have identified a trait in most living
organisms which can drive the particular organism to compete. This trait,
unsurprisingly called competitiveness, is viewed as an innate _b_i_o_l_o_g_i_c_a_l _t_r_a_i_t
which coexists along with the urge for survival. Competitiveness, or the
inclination to compete, though, has become synonymous with aggressiveness and
ambition in the _E_n_g_l_i_s_h_ _l_a_n_g_u_a_g_e. More advanced _c_i_v_i_l_i_z_a_t_i_o_n_s integrate
aggressiveness and competitiveness into their _i_n_t_e_r_a_c_t_i_o_n_s, as a way to
distribute resources and adapt. Most plants compete for higher spots on trees
to receive more sunlight.
However, _S_t_e_p_h_e_n_ _J_a_y_ _G_o_u_l_d and others have argued that as one ascends the
evolutionary hierarchy, competitiveness (the survival instinct) becomes less
innate, and more a learned behavior.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] The same could be said
for co-operation: in humans, at least, both co-operation and competition are
considered learned behaviors, because the human species learns to adapt to
environmental pressures. Consequently, if survival requires competitive
behaviors, the individual will compete, and if survival requires co-operative
behaviors, the individual will co-operate. In the case of humans, therefore,
aggressiveness may be an innate characteristic, but a person need not be
competitive at the same time, for instance when scaling a cliff. On the other
hand, humans seem also to have a nurturing instinct, to protect newborns and
the weak. While that does not necessitate co-operative behavior, it does help.
The term also applies to _e_c_o_n_o_m_e_t_r_i_c_s. Here, it is a comparative measure of the
ability and performance of a firm or sub-sector to sell and produce/supply
goods and/or services in a given market. The two academic bodies of thought on

Predicting changes in the competitiveness of business sectors is becoming an
integral and explicit step in public policymaking. Within capitalist economic

competitiveness.

The tendency toward extreme, unhealthy competition has been termed

_n_e_u_r_o_s_i_s; specifically, the highly aggressive personality type which is
characterized as "moving against people". In her view, some people have a need
to compete and win at all costs as a means of maintaining their _s_e_l_f_-_w_o_r_t_h.
These individuals are likely to turn any activity into a competition, and they
will feel threatened if they find themselves losing. Researchers have found
that men and women who score high on the trait of hypercompetitiveness are more

is created such "climate of competitive egoism and individualism" with

therefore society must be based on mutual love, cooperation and sacrifice for
the well-being of humanity._[_2_1_] In the society desired by Gandhi, each
individual will cooperate and serve for the welfare of others and people will
share each other's joys, sorrows and achievements as a norm of a social life.
For him, in a non-violent society, competition does not have a place and this
should become realized with more people making the personal choice to have less
tendencies toward egoism and selfishness._[_2_1_]
