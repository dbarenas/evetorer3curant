_I_n_v_e_s_t_m_e_n_t analysis (or _c_a_p_i_t_a_l_ _b_u_d_g_e_t_i_n_g) is concerned with the setting of
criteria about which value-adding projects should receive investment funding,
and whether to finance that investment with _e_q_u_i_t_y or _d_e_b_t capital. Short-term
finance is the management of the company's monetary funds that deal with the
short-term balance of _c_u_r_r_e_n_t_ _a_s_s_e_t_s and _c_u_r_r_e_n_t_ _l_i_a_b_i_l_i_t_i_e_s; the focus here is
on managing cash, _i_n_v_e_n_t_o_r_i_e_s, and short-term borrowing and lending (such as
the terms on credit extended to customers).[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]
The terms corporate finance and ccoorrppoorraattee ffiinnaanncciieerr are also associated with
_i_n_v_e_s_t_m_e_n_t_ _b_a_n_k_i_n_g. The typical role of an _i_n_v_e_s_t_m_e_n_t_ _b_a_n_k is to evaluate the
company's financial needs and raise the appropriate type of capital that best
fits those needs. Thus, the terms ‚Äúcorporate finance‚Äù and ‚Äúcorporate
financier‚Äù may be associated with transactions in which capital is raised in
order to create, develop, grow or acquire businesses.

Investment analysis (or capital budgeting) is the planning of value-adding,
long-term corporate financial projects relating to investments funded through
and affecting the firm's _c_a_p_i_t_a_l_ _s_t_r_u_c_t_u_r_e. Management must allocate the firm's
limited resources between competing opportunities (projects), which is one of
the main focuses of capital budgeting._[_2_] Capital budgeting is also concerned
with the setting of criteria about which projects should receive investment
funding to increase the value of the firm, and whether to finance that
investment with equity or debt capital. Investments should be made on the basis
of value-added to the future of the corporation. Projects that increase a
firm's value may include a wide variety of different types of investments,
including but not limited to, expansion policies, or _m_e_r_g_e_r_s_ _a_n_d_ _a_c_q_u_i_s_i_t_i_o_n_s.
When no such value can be added through the capital budgeting process and
excess cash surplus exists and is not needed, then management is expected to
pay out some or all of those surplus earnings in the form of cash dividends or
to repurchase the company's stock through a share buyback program.
Choosing between investment projects may be based upon several inter-related
criteria. (1) Corporate management seeks to maximize the value of the firm by
investing in projects which yield a positive net present value when valued
using an appropriate discount rate in consideration of risk. (2) These projects
must also be financed appropriately. (3) If no positive NPV projects exist and
excess cash surplus is not needed to the firm, then financial theory suggests
that management should return some or all of the excess cash to shareholders
(i.e., distribution via dividends).

The primary objective of financial management is to maximize shareholder value.
Maximizing shareholder value requires managers to be able to balance capital
funding between investments in projects that increase the firm's long term
profitability and sustainability, along with paying excess cash in the form of
dividends to shareholders. Managers of growth companies (i.e. firms that earn
high rates of return on invested capital) will use most of the firm's capital
resources and surplus cash on investments and projects so the company can
continue to expand its business operations into the future. When companies
reach maturity levels within their industry (i.e. companies that earn
approximately average or lower returns on invested capital), managers of these
companies will use surplus cash to payout dividends to shareholders. In
practice, this is a difficult task, because managers must do an analysis to
determine the appropriate allocation of the firm's capital resources and cash
surplus between projects and payouts of dividends to shareholders, as well as
paying back creditor related debt.

Return on investment is the concept of an investment in some resource or asset
yielding an appreciation in value to the investor. In purely economic terms,
ROI is used to measure the profits gained in comparison to the capital
invested. ROI is a broad method for investment valuation, and may be employed
using different valuation approaches. One method is to compare the investment
value and its opportunity cost to other forms of investments available (this
method is generally known in finance as the cost of capital). Alternative
methods may include a cost-benefit analysis of the future recurring growth or
sustainability of the profits from the investment. When profit levels cannot be
accurately forecasted, investors are advised to _b_e_n_c_h_m_a_r_k their investments
against comparable assets (such as to evaluate industry standard best practices
and to do a company analysis in stock valuation) to help them estimate the
earnings multiplier or the return on capital likely to be received in the
future.

Achieving the goals of corporate finance requires that any corporate investment
be financed appropriately._[_3_] The sources of financing are, generically,
_c_a_p_i_t_a_l_ _s_e_l_f_-_g_e_n_e_r_a_t_e_d_ _b_y_ _t_h_e_ _f_i_r_m and capital from external funders, obtained
by issuing new _d_e_b_t and _e_q_u_i_t_y (and _h_y_b_r_i_d_- or _c_o_n_v_e_r_t_i_b_l_e_ _s_e_c_u_r_i_t_i_e_s). As
above, since both hurdle rate and cash flows (and hence the riskiness of the
firm) will be affected, the financing mix will impact the valuation of the
firm. There are two interrelated considerations here:
    * Management must identify the "optimal mix" of financing ‚Äì the capital
      structure that results in maximum firm value._[_4_] (See _B_a_l_a_n_c_e_ _s_h_e_e_t,
      _W_A_C_C.) Financing a project through debt results in a _l_i_a_b_i_l_i_t_y or
      obligation that must be serviced, thus entailing cash flow implications
      independent of the project's degree of success. Equity financing is less
      risky with respect to cash flow commitments, but results in a _d_i_l_u_t_i_o_n of
      share ownership, control and earnings. The _c_o_s_t_ _o_f_ _e_q_u_i_t_y (see _C_A_P_M and
      _A_P_T) is also typically higher than the _c_o_s_t_ _o_f_ _d_e_b_t - which is,
      additionally, a _d_e_d_u_c_t_i_b_l_e_ _e_x_p_e_n_s_e ‚Äì and so equity financing may result
      in an increased hurdle rate which may offset any reduction in cash flow
      risk._[_5_]
    * Management must attempt to match the long-term financing mix to the
      _a_s_s_e_t_s being financed as closely as possible, in terms of both timing and
      cash flows. Managing any potential _a_s_s_e_t_ _l_i_a_b_i_l_i_t_y_ _m_i_s_m_a_t_c_h or _d_u_r_a_t_i_o_n
      _g_a_p entails matching the assets and _l_i_a_b_i_l_i_t_i_e_s respectively according to

Much of the theory here, falls under the umbrella of the _T_r_a_d_e_-_O_f_f_ _T_h_e_o_r_y in
which firms are assumed to trade-off the _t_a_x_ _b_e_n_e_f_i_t_s_ _o_f_ _d_e_b_t with the

However economists have developed a set of alternative theories about how
managers allocate a corporation's finances. One of the main alternative
theories of how firms manage their capital funds is the _P_e_c_k_i_n_g_ _O_r_d_e_r_ _T_h_e_o_r_y
(_S_t_e_w_a_r_t_ _M_y_e_r_s), which suggests that firms avoid _e_x_t_e_r_n_a_l_ _f_i_n_a_n_c_i_n_g while they
have _i_n_t_e_r_n_a_l_ _f_i_n_a_n_c_i_n_g available and avoid new equity financing while they can
engage in new debt financing at reasonably low _i_n_t_e_r_e_s_t_ _r_a_t_e_s. Also, _C_a_p_i_t_a_l
_s_t_r_u_c_t_u_r_e_ _s_u_b_s_t_i_t_u_t_i_o_n_ _t_h_e_o_r_y hypothesizes that management manipulates the
capital structure such that _e_a_r_n_i_n_g_s_ _p_e_r_ _s_h_a_r_e (EPS) are maximized. An emerging
area in finance theory is _r_i_g_h_t_-_f_i_n_a_n_c_i_n_g whereby investment banks and
corporations can enhance investment return and company value over time by
determining the right investment objectives, policy framework, institutional
structure, source of financing (debt or equity) and expenditure framework
within a given economy and under given market conditions. One of the more
recent innovations in this area from a theoretical point of view is the _M_a_r_k_e_t
_t_i_m_i_n_g_ _h_y_p_o_t_h_e_s_i_s. This hypothesis, inspired in the behavioral finance
literature, states that firms look for the cheaper type of financing regardless
of their current levels of internal resources, debt and equity.

Corporations may rely on borrowed funds (debt capital or _c_r_e_d_i_t) as sources of
investment to sustain ongoing business operations or to fund future growth.
Debt comes in several forms, such as through bank loans, notes payable, or
bonds issued to the public. Bonds require the corporations to make regular
_i_n_t_e_r_e_s_t payments (interest expenses) on the borrowed capital until the debt
reaches its maturity date, therein the firm must pay back the obligation in
full. Debt payments can also be made in the form of sinking fund provisions,
whereby the corporation pays annual installments of the borrowed debt above
regular interest charges. Corporations that issue callable bonds are entitled
to pay back the obligation in full whenever the company feels it is in their
best interest to pay off the debt payments. If interest expenses cannot be made
by the corporation through cash payments, the firm may also use _c_o_l_l_a_t_e_r_a_l
assets as a form of repaying their debt obligations (or through the process of
_l_i_q_u_i_d_a_t_i_o_n).

Corporations can alternatively sell shares of the company to investors to raise
capital. Investors, or shareholders, expect that the value of the company will
appreciate over time to make their investment a profitable venture. Shareholder
value is increased when corporations invest equity capital and other funds into
projects (or investments) that earn a positive rate of return for the owners.
Investors prefer to buy shares of stock into companies that will consistently
earn a positive rate of return on capital in the future, thus increasing the
market value of the stock of that corporation. Shareholder value may also be
increased when corporations payout excess cash surplus (funds from retained
earnings that are not needed for business) in the form of dividends.

Preferred stock is an equity security which may have any combination of
features not possessed by common stock including properties of both an equity
and a debt instruments, and is generally considered a hybrid instrument.
Preferreds are senior (i.e. higher ranking) to _c_o_m_m_o_n_ _s_t_o_c_k, but subordinate to
_b_o_n_d_s in terms of claim (or rights to their share of the assets of the
company)._[_6_]
Preferred stock usually carries no voting rights,_[_7_] but may carry a _d_i_v_i_d_e_n_d
and may have priority over _c_o_m_m_o_n_ _s_t_o_c_k in the payment of dividends and upon
_l_i_q_u_i_d_a_t_i_o_n. Terms of the preferred stock are stated in a "Certificate of
Designation".
Similar to bonds, preferred stocks are rated by the major credit-rating
companies. The rating for preferreds is generally lower, since preferred
dividends do not carry the same guarantees as interest payments from bonds and
they are junior to all creditors._[_8_]
Preferred stock is a special class of shares which may have any combination of
features not possessed by common stock. The following features are usually
associated with preferred stock:_[_9_]
    * Preference in _d_i_v_i_d_e_n_d_s
    * Preference in assets, in the event of _l_i_q_u_i_d_a_t_i_o_n
    * Convertibility to common stock.
    * Callability, at the option of the corporation

In general,_[_1_0_] each project's value will be estimated using a _d_i_s_c_o_u_n_t_e_d_ _c_a_s_h
_f_l_o_w (DCF) valuation, and the opportunity with the highest value, as measured
by the resultant _n_e_t_ _p_r_e_s_e_n_t_ _v_a_l_u_e (NPV) will be selected (applied to Corporate
Finance by _J_o_e_l_ _D_e_a_n in 1951). This requires estimating the size and timing of
all of the incremental _c_a_s_h_ _f_l_o_w_s resulting from the project. Such future cash
flows are then _d_i_s_c_o_u_n_t_e_d to determine their _p_r_e_s_e_n_t_ _v_a_l_u_e (see _T_i_m_e_ _v_a_l_u_e_ _o_f
_m_o_n_e_y). These present values are then summed, and this sum net of the initial
investment outlay is the _N_P_V. See _F_i_n_a_n_c_i_a_l_ _m_o_d_e_l_i_n_g.
The NPV is greatly affected by the _d_i_s_c_o_u_n_t_ _r_a_t_e. Thus, identifying the proper
discount rate ‚Äì often termed, the project "hurdle rate"_[_1_1_] ‚Äì is critical
to choosing good projects and investments for the firm. The hurdle rate is the
minimum acceptable _r_e_t_u_r_n on an investment ‚Äì i.e., the _p_r_o_j_e_c_t_ _a_p_p_r_o_p_r_i_a_t_e
_d_i_s_c_o_u_n_t_ _r_a_t_e. The hurdle rate should reflect the riskiness of the investment,
typically measured by _v_o_l_a_t_i_l_i_t_y of cash flows, and must take into account the
project-relevant financing mix._[_1_2_] Managers use models such as the _C_A_P_M or the
_A_P_T to estimate a discount rate appropriate for a particular project, and use
the _w_e_i_g_h_t_e_d_ _a_v_e_r_a_g_e_ _c_o_s_t_ _o_f_ _c_a_p_i_t_a_l (WACC) to reflect the financing mix
selected. (A common error in choosing a discount rate for a project is to apply
a WACC that applies to the entire firm. Such an approach may not be appropriate
where the risk of a particular project differs markedly from that of the firm's
existing portfolio of assets.)
In conjunction with NPV, there are several other measures used as (secondary)
_s_e_l_e_c_t_i_o_n_ _c_r_i_t_e_r_i_a in corporate finance. These are visible from the DCF and

In many cases, for example _R_&_D projects, a project may open (or close) various
paths of action to the company, but this reality will not (typically) be
captured in a strict NPV approach._[_1_3_] Some analysts account for this
uncertainty by adjusting the discount rate (e.g. by increasing the _c_o_s_t_ _o_f
_c_a_p_i_t_a_l) or the cash flows (using _c_e_r_t_a_i_n_t_y_ _e_q_u_i_v_a_l_e_n_t_s, or applying
(subjective) "haircuts" to the forecast numbers)._[_1_4_]_[_1_5_] Even when employed,
however, these latter methods do not normally properly account for changes in
risk over the project's lifecycle and hence fail to appropriately adapt the
risk adjustment._[_1_6_] Management will therefore (sometimes) employ tools which
place an explicit value on these options. So, whereas in a DCF valuation the
_m_o_s_t_ _l_i_k_e_l_y or average or _s_c_e_n_a_r_i_o_ _s_p_e_c_i_f_i_c cash flows are discounted, here the
‚Äúflexible and staged nature‚Äù of the investment is _m_o_d_e_l_l_e_d, and hence "all"
potential _p_a_y_o_f_f_s are considered. See _f_u_r_t_h_e_r under _R_e_a_l_ _o_p_t_i_o_n_s_ _v_a_l_u_a_t_i_o_n. The
difference between the two valuations is the "value of flexibility" inherent in
the project.
The two most common tools are _D_e_c_i_s_i_o_n_ _T_r_e_e_ _A_n_a_l_y_s_i_s (DTA)_[_1_7_]_[_1_8_] and _R_e_a_l
_o_p_t_i_o_n_s_ _v_a_l_u_a_t_i_o_n (ROV);_[_1_9_] they may often be used interchangeably:
    * DTA values flexibility by incorporating _p_o_s_s_i_b_l_e_ _e_v_e_n_t_s (or _s_t_a_t_e_s) and
      consequent _m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t_ _d_e_c_i_s_i_o_n_s. (For example, a company would build a
      factory given that demand for its product exceeded a certain level during
      the pilot-phase, and _o_u_t_s_o_u_r_c_e production otherwise. In turn, given
      further demand, it would similarly expand the factory, and maintain it
      otherwise. In a DCF model, by contrast, there is no "branching" ‚Äì each
      scenario must be modelled separately.) In the _d_e_c_i_s_i_o_n_ _t_r_e_e, each
      management decision in response to an "event" generates a "branch" or
      "path" which the company could follow; the probabilities of each event
      are determined or specified by management. Once the tree is constructed:
      (1) "all" possible events and their resultant paths are visible to
      management; (2) given this ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù of the events that could
      follow, and assuming _r_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _d_e_c_i_s_i_o_n_ _m_a_k_i_n_g, management chooses the
      branches (i.e. actions) corresponding to the highest value path
      _p_r_o_b_a_b_i_l_i_t_y_ _w_e_i_g_h_t_e_d; (3) this path is then taken as representative of
      project value. See _D_e_c_i_s_i_o_n_ _t_h_e_o_r_y_#_C_h_o_i_c_e_ _u_n_d_e_r_ _u_n_c_e_r_t_a_i_n_t_y.
    * ROV is usually used when the value of a project is _c_o_n_t_i_n_g_e_n_t on the
      _v_a_l_u_e of some other asset or _u_n_d_e_r_l_y_i_n_g_ _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e. (For example, the
      _v_i_a_b_i_l_i_t_y of a _m_i_n_i_n_g project is contingent on the price of _g_o_l_d; if the
      price is too low, management will abandon the _m_i_n_i_n_g_ _r_i_g_h_t_s, if
      sufficiently high, management will _d_e_v_e_l_o_p the _o_r_e_ _b_o_d_y. Again, a DCF
      valuation would capture only one of these outcomes.) Here: (1) using
      _f_i_n_a_n_c_i_a_l_ _o_p_t_i_o_n_ _t_h_e_o_r_y as a framework, the decision to be taken is
      identified as corresponding to either a _c_a_l_l_ _o_p_t_i_o_n or a _p_u_t_ _o_p_t_i_o_n; (2)
      an appropriate valuation technique is then employed ‚Äì usually a variant
      on the _B_i_n_o_m_i_a_l_ _o_p_t_i_o_n_s_ _m_o_d_e_l or a bespoke _s_i_m_u_l_a_t_i_o_n_ _m_o_d_e_l, while _B_l_a_c_k

      _v_a_l_u_a_t_i_o_n. (3) The "true" value of the project is then the NPV of the
      "most likely" scenario plus the option value. (Real options in corporate
      finance were first discussed by _S_t_e_w_a_r_t_ _M_y_e_r_s in 1977; viewing corporate

Given the _u_n_c_e_r_t_a_i_n_t_y inherent in project forecasting and valuation,_[_1_8_]_[_2_0_]
analysts will wish to assess the sensitivity of project NPV to the various
inputs (i.e. assumptions) to the DCF _m_o_d_e_l. In a typical _s_e_n_s_i_t_i_v_i_t_y_ _a_n_a_l_y_s_i_s
the analyst will vary one key factor while holding all other inputs constant,
_c_e_t_e_r_i_s_ _p_a_r_i_b_u_s. The sensitivity of NPV to a change in that factor is then
observed, and is calculated as a "slope": ŒîNPV / Œîfactor. For example, the
analyst will determine NPV at various _g_r_o_w_t_h_ _r_a_t_e_s in _a_n_n_u_a_l_ _r_e_v_e_n_u_e as
specified (usually at set increments, e.g. -10%, -5%, 0%, 5%....), and then
determine the sensitivity using this formula. Often, several variables may be
of interest, and their various combinations produce a "value-_s_u_r_f_a_c_e",_[_2_1_] (or
even a "value-_s_p_a_c_e",) where NPV is then a _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n_ _o_f_ _s_e_v_e_r_a_l_ _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e_s. See
also _S_t_r_e_s_s_ _t_e_s_t_i_n_g.
Using a related technique, analysts also run _s_c_e_n_a_r_i_o_ _b_a_s_e_d forecasts of NPV.
Here, a scenario comprises a particular outcome for economy-wide, "global"
factors (_d_e_m_a_n_d_ _f_o_r_ _t_h_e_ _p_r_o_d_u_c_t, _e_x_c_h_a_n_g_e_ _r_a_t_e_s, _c_o_m_m_o_d_i_t_y_ _p_r_i_c_e_s, etc...) as
well as for company-specific factors (_u_n_i_t_ _c_o_s_t_s, etc...). As an example, the
analyst may specify various revenue growth scenarios (e.g. 0% for "Worst Case",
10% for "Likely Case" and 20% for "Best Case"), where all key inputs are
adjusted so as to be consistent with the growth assumptions, and calculate the
NPV for each. Note that for scenario based analysis, the various combinations
of inputs must be internally consistent (see _d_i_s_c_u_s_s_i_o_n at _F_i_n_a_n_c_i_a_l_ _m_o_d_e_l_i_n_g),
whereas for the sensitivity approach these need not be so. An application of
this methodology is to determine an "_u_n_b_i_a_s_e_d" NPV, where management determines
a (subjective) probability for each scenario ‚Äì the NPV for the project is
then the _p_r_o_b_a_b_i_l_i_t_y_-_w_e_i_g_h_t_e_d_ _a_v_e_r_a_g_e of the various scenarios. See _F_i_r_s_t
_C_h_i_c_a_g_o_ _M_e_t_h_o_d.
A further advancement which "overcomes the limitations of sensitivity and
scenario analyses by examining the effects of all possible combinations of
variables and their realizations." _[_2_2_] is to construct _s_t_o_c_h_a_s_t_i_c_[_2_3_] or
_p_r_o_b_a_b_i_l_i_s_t_i_c financial models ‚Äì as opposed to the traditional static and
_d_e_t_e_r_m_i_n_i_s_t_i_c models as above._[_2_0_] For this purpose, the most common method is
to use _M_o_n_t_e_ _C_a_r_l_o_ _s_i_m_u_l_a_t_i_o_n to analyze the project‚Äôs NPV. This method was
introduced to finance by _D_a_v_i_d_ _B_._ _H_e_r_t_z in 1964, although it has only recently
become common: today analysts are even able to run simulations in _s_p_r_e_a_d_s_h_e_e_t
based DCF models, typically using a _r_i_s_k_-_a_n_a_l_y_s_i_s_ _a_d_d_-_i_n, such as @Risk or
Crystal Ball. Here, the cash flow components that are (heavily) impacted by
uncertainty are simulated, mathematically reflecting their "random
characteristics". In contrast to the scenario approach above, the simulation
produces several thousand _r_a_n_d_o_m but possible outcomes, or trials, "covering
all conceivable real world contingencies in proportion to their likelihood;"
_[_2_4_] see _M_o_n_t_e_ _C_a_r_l_o_ _S_i_m_u_l_a_t_i_o_n_ _v_e_r_s_u_s_ _‚_Ä_ú_W_h_a_t_ _I_f_‚_Ä_ù_ _S_c_e_n_a_r_i_o_s. The output is
then a _h_i_s_t_o_g_r_a_m of project NPV, and the average NPV of the potential
investment ‚Äì as well as its _v_o_l_a_t_i_l_i_t_y and other sensitivities ‚Äì is then
observed. This histogram provides information not visible from the static DCF:
for example, it allows for an estimate of the probability that a project has a
net present value greater than zero (or any other value).
Continuing the above example: instead of assigning three discrete values to
revenue growth, and to the other relevant variables, the analyst would assign
an appropriate _p_r_o_b_a_b_i_l_i_t_y_ _d_i_s_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_o_n to each variable (commonly _t_r_i_a_n_g_u_l_a_r
or _b_e_t_a), and, where possible, specify the observed or supposed _c_o_r_r_e_l_a_t_i_o_n
between the variables. These distributions would then be "sampled" repeatedly
‚Äì _i_n_c_o_r_p_o_r_a_t_i_n_g_ _t_h_i_s_ _c_o_r_r_e_l_a_t_i_o_n ‚Äì so as to generate several thousand
random but possible scenarios, with corresponding valuations, which are then
used to generate the NPV histogram. The resultant statistics (_a_v_e_r_a_g_e NPV and
_s_t_a_n_d_a_r_d_ _d_e_v_i_a_t_i_o_n of NPV) will be a more accurate mirror of the project's
"randomness" than the variance observed under the scenario based approach.
These are often used as estimates of the _u_n_d_e_r_l_y_i_n_g "_s_p_o_t_ _p_r_i_c_e" and volatility

of risk events (e.g., a _c_r_e_d_i_t_ _c_r_u_n_c_h) that drive variations in one or more of
the DCF model inputs.

Dividend policy is concerned with financial policies regarding the payment of a
cash dividend in the present or paying an increased dividend at a later stage.
Whether to issue dividends,_[_2_5_] and what amount, is determined mainly on the
basis of the company's unappropriated _p_r_o_f_i_t (excess cash) and influenced by
the company's long-term earning power. When cash surplus exists and is not
needed by the firm, then management is expected to pay out some or all of those
surplus earnings in the form of cash dividends or to repurchase the company's
stock through a share buyback program.
If there are no NPV positive opportunities, i.e. projects where _r_e_t_u_r_n_s exceed
the hurdle rate, and excess cash surplus is not needed, then ‚Äì finance theory
suggests ‚Äì management should return some or all of the excess cash to
shareholders as dividends. This is the general case, however there are
exceptions. For example, shareholders of a "_g_r_o_w_t_h_ _s_t_o_c_k", expect that the
company will, almost by definition, retain most of the excess cash surplus so
as to fund future projects internally to help increase the value of the firm.
By withholding current dividend payments to shareholders, managers of _g_r_o_w_t_h
companies are hoping that dividend payments will be increased proportionality
higher in the future, to offset the retainment of current earnings and the
internal financing of present investment projects.
Management must also choose the form of the dividend distribution, generally as
cash _d_i_v_i_d_e_n_d_s or via a _s_h_a_r_e_ _b_u_y_b_a_c_k. Various factors may be taken into
consideration: where shareholders must pay _t_a_x_ _o_n_ _d_i_v_i_d_e_n_d_s, firms may elect to
retain earnings or to perform a stock buyback, in both cases increasing the
value of shares outstanding. Alternatively, some companies will pay "dividends"
from _s_t_o_c_k rather than in cash; see _C_o_r_p_o_r_a_t_e_ _a_c_t_i_o_n. Financial theory suggests
that the dividend policy should be set based upon the type of company and what
management determines is the best use of those dividend resources for the firm
to its shareholders. As a general rule, shareholders of growth companies would
prefer managers to have a share buyback program, whereas shareholders of value
or secondary stocks would prefer the management of these companies to payout
surplus earnings in the form of cash dividends.

How to manage the corporation's _w_o_r_k_i_n_g_ _c_a_p_i_t_a_l position to sustain ongoing
business operations is referred to as working capital management._[_2_6_] These
involve managing the relationship between a firm's _s_h_o_r_t_-_t_e_r_m_ _a_s_s_e_t_s and its
_s_h_o_r_t_-_t_e_r_m_ _l_i_a_b_i_l_i_t_i_e_s. In general this is as follows: As above, the goal of
Corporate Finance is the maximization of firm value. In the context of long
term, capital budgeting, firm value is enhanced through appropriately selecting
and funding NPV positive investments. These investments, in turn, have
implications in terms of cash flow and _c_o_s_t_ _o_f_ _c_a_p_i_t_a_l. The goal of Working
Capital (i.e. short term) management is therefore to ensure that the firm is
able to _o_p_e_r_a_t_e, and that it has sufficient cash flow to service long term
debt, and to satisfy both maturing _s_h_o_r_t_-_t_e_r_m_ _d_e_b_t and upcoming operational
expenses. In so doing, firm value is enhanced when, and if, the _r_e_t_u_r_n_ _o_n
_c_a_p_i_t_a_l exceeds the cost of capital; See _E_c_o_n_o_m_i_c_ _v_a_l_u_e_ _a_d_d_e_d (EVA). Managing
short term finance and long term finance is one task of a modern CFO.

Working capital is the amount of funds which are necessary to an organization
to continue its ongoing business operations, until the firm is reimbursed
through payments for the goods or services it has delivered to its customers.
_[_2_7_] Working capital is measured through the difference between resources in
cash or readily convertible into cash (Current Assets), and cash requirements
(Current Liabilities). As a result, capital resource allocations relating to
working capital are always current, i.e. short term. In addition to _t_i_m_e
_h_o_r_i_z_o_n, working capital management differs from capital budgeting in terms of
_d_i_s_c_o_u_n_t_i_n_g and profitability considerations; they are also "reversible" to
some extent. (Considerations as to _R_i_s_k_ _a_p_p_e_t_i_t_e and return targets remain
identical, although some constraints ‚Äì such as those imposed by _l_o_a_n
_c_o_v_e_n_a_n_t_s ‚Äì may be more relevant here).
The (short term) goals of working capital are therefore not approached on the
same basis as (long term) profitability, and working capital management applies
different criteria in allocating resources: the main considerations are (1)
cash flow / liquidity and (2) profitability / return on capital (of which cash
flow is probably the most important).
    * The most widely used measure of cash flow is the net operating cycle, or
      _c_a_s_h_ _c_o_n_v_e_r_s_i_o_n_ _c_y_c_l_e. This represents the time difference between cash
      payment for raw materials and cash collection for sales. The cash
      conversion cycle indicates the firm's ability to convert its resources
      into cash. Because this number effectively corresponds to the time that
      the firm's cash is tied up in operations and unavailable for other
      activities, management generally aims at a low net count. (Another
      measure is gross operating cycle which is the same as net operating cycle
      except that it does not take into account the creditors deferral period.)
    * In this context, the most useful measure of profitability is _R_e_t_u_r_n_ _o_n
      _c_a_p_i_t_a_l (ROC). The result is shown as a percentage, determined by
      dividing relevant income for the 12 months by capital employed; _R_e_t_u_r_n_ _o_n
      _e_q_u_i_t_y (ROE) shows this result for the firm's shareholders. As above,
      firm value is enhanced when, and if, the return on capital exceeds the
      _c_o_s_t_ _o_f_ _c_a_p_i_t_a_l.

Guided by the above criteria, management will use a combination of policies and
techniques for the management of working capital._[_2_8_] These policies aim at
managing the _c_u_r_r_e_n_t_ _a_s_s_e_t_s (generally _c_a_s_h and _c_a_s_h_ _e_q_u_i_v_a_l_e_n_t_s, _i_n_v_e_n_t_o_r_i_e_s

Use of the term ‚Äúcorporate finance‚Äù varies considerably across the world.
In the _U_n_i_t_e_d_ _S_t_a_t_e_s it is used, as above, to describe activities, analytical
methods and techniques that deal with many aspects of a company‚Äôs finances
and capital. In the _U_n_i_t_e_d_ _K_i_n_g_d_o_m and _C_o_m_m_o_n_w_e_a_l_t_h countries, the terms
‚Äúcorporate finance‚Äù and ‚Äúcorporate financier‚Äù tend to be associated
with _i_n_v_e_s_t_m_e_n_t_ _b_a_n_k_i_n_g ‚Äì i.e. with transactions in which capital is raised
for the corporation._[_3_0_] These may include
    * Raising seed, start-up, development or expansion capital
    * Mergers, demergers, acquisitions or the sale of private companies
    * Mergers, demergers and takeovers of public companies, including public-
      to-private deals
    * Management buy-out, buy-in or similar of companies, divisions or
      subsidiaries ‚Äì typically backed by private equity
    * Equity issues by companies, including the flotation of companies on a
      recognised stock exchange in order to raise capital for development and/
      or to restructure ownership
    * Raising capital via the issue of other forms of equity, debt and related
      securities for the refinancing and restructuring of businesses
    * Financing joint ventures, project finance, infrastructure finance,
      public-private partnerships and privatisations
    * Secondary equity issues, whether by means of private placing or further

_m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t, typically, is focused on the impact on corporate value due to
adverse changes in _c_o_m_m_o_d_i_t_y_ _p_r_i_c_e_s, _i_n_t_e_r_e_s_t_ _r_a_t_e_s, _f_o_r_e_i_g_n_ _e_x_c_h_a_n_g_e_ _r_a_t_e_s and

to have risk management teams; often these overlap with the _i_n_t_e_r_n_a_l_ _a_u_d_i_t
function. While it is impractical for small firms to have a formal risk
management function, many still apply risk management informally. See also

The discipline typically focuses on risks that can be hedged using traded
_f_i_n_a_n_c_i_a_l_ _i_n_s_t_r_u_m_e_n_t_s, typically _d_e_r_i_v_a_t_i_v_e_s; see _C_a_s_h_ _f_l_o_w_ _h_e_d_g_e, _F_o_r_e_i_g_n

_c_o_u_n_t_e_r" (_O_T_C) _c_o_n_t_r_a_c_t_s tend to be costly to create and monitor, derivatives
that trade on well-established _f_i_n_a_n_c_i_a_l_ _m_a_r_k_e_t_s or _e_x_c_h_a_n_g_e_s are often
preferred. These standard derivative instruments include _o_p_t_i_o_n_s, _f_u_t_u_r_e_s
_c_o_n_t_r_a_c_t_s, _f_o_r_w_a_r_d_ _c_o_n_t_r_a_c_t_s, and _s_w_a_p_s; the "second generation" _e_x_o_t_i_c
_d_e_r_i_v_a_t_i_v_e_s usually trade OTC. Note that hedging-related transactions will
attract their own _a_c_c_o_u_n_t_i_n_g treatment: see _H_e_d_g_e_ _a_c_c_o_u_n_t_i_n_g, _M_a_r_k_-_t_o_-_m_a_r_k_e_t

This area is related to corporate finance in two ways. Firstly, firm exposure
to business and _m_a_r_k_e_t_ _r_i_s_k is a direct result of previous capital financial
investments. Secondly, both disciplines share the goal of enhancing, or
preserving, firm _v_a_l_u_e. There is a fundamental debate _[_3_2_] relating to "Risk
Management" and _s_h_a_r_e_h_o_l_d_e_r_ _v_a_l_u_e. Per the _M_o_d_i_g_l_i_a_n_i_ _a_n_d_ _M_i_l_l_e_r_ _f_r_a_m_e_w_o_r_k,
hedging is irrelevant since diversified shareholders are assumed to not care
about firm-specific risks, whereas, on the other hand hedging is seen to create
value in that it reduces the probability of financial distress. A further
question, is the shareholder's desire to optimize risk versus taking exposure
to pure risk (a risk event that only has a negative side, such as loss of life
or limb). The debate links the value of risk management in a market to the cost
of bankruptcy in that market.
