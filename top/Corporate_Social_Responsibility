a _b_u_s_i_n_e_s_s_ _m_o_d_e_l. CSR policy functions as a built-in, self-regulating mechanism
whereby a business monitors and ensures its active compliance with the spirit
of the law, ethical standards, and international _n_o_r_m_s. In some models, a
firm's implementation of CSR goes beyond compliance and engages in "actions
that appear to further some social good, beyond the interests of the firm and
that which is required by law."_[_2_]_[_3_] CSR is a process with the aim to embrace
responsibility for the company's actions and encourage a positive impact
through its activities on the environment, consumers, employees, communities,
_s_t_a_k_e_h_o_l_d_e_r_s and all other members of the _p_u_b_l_i_c_ _s_p_h_e_r_e who may also be
considered as stakeholders.
The term "corporate social responsibility" came into common use in the late
1960s and early 1970s after many multinational corporations formed the term
_s_t_a_k_e_h_o_l_d_e_r, meaning those on whom an organization's activities have an impact.
It was used to describe corporate owners beyond _s_h_a_r_e_h_o_l_d_e_r_s as a result of an
influential book by _R_._ _E_d_w_a_r_d_ _F_r_e_e_m_a_n, Strategic management: a stakeholder
approach in 1984._[_4_]
Proponents argue that corporations make more long term profits by operating
with a perspective, while critics argue that CSR distracts from the economic
role of businesses. McWilliams and Siegel's article (2000) published in
_S_t_r_a_t_e_g_i_c_ _M_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t_ _J_o_u_r_n_a_l, cited by over 1000 academics, compared existing
_e_c_o_n_o_m_e_t_r_i_c studies of the relationship between social and financial
performance. They concluded that the contradictory results of previous studies
reporting positive, negative, and neutral financial impact, were due to flawed
_e_m_p_i_r_i_c_a_l_ _a_n_a_l_y_s_i_s. McWilliams and Siegel demonstrated that when the model is
properly specified; that is, when you control for investment in _R_e_s_e_a_r_c_h_ _a_n_d
_D_e_v_e_l_o_p_m_e_n_t, an important determinant of financial performance, CSR has a
neutral impact on financial outcomes._[_5_]
In his widely-cited book_[_6_]_[_7_] entitled Misguided Virtue: False Notions of
Corporate Social Responsibility (2001) David Henderson argued forcefully
against the way in which CSR broke from traditional corporate value-setting. He
questioned the "lofty" and sometimes "unrealistic expectations" in CSR._[_8_]
Some argue that CSR is merely _w_i_n_d_o_w_-_d_r_e_s_s_i_n_g, or an attempt to pre-empt the
role of governments as a watchdog over powerful _m_u_l_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _c_o_r_p_o_r_a_t_i_o_n_s.
CSR is titled to aid an organization's mission as well as a guide to what the
company stands for and will uphold to its consumers. Development _b_u_s_i_n_e_s_s
_e_t_h_i_c_s is one of the forms of _a_p_p_l_i_e_d_ _e_t_h_i_c_s that examines ethical principles

_2_6_0_0_0 is the recognized international standard for CSR. Public sector
organizations (the United Nations for example) adhere to the _t_r_i_p_l_e_ _b_o_t_t_o_m_ _l_i_n_e
(TBL). It is widely accepted that CSR adheres to similar principles but with no
formal act of legislation. The _U_N has developed the _P_r_i_n_c_i_p_l_e_s_ _f_o_r_ _R_e_s_p_o_n_s_i_b_l_e

CSR Approaches
Some commentators have identified a difference between the Canadian (Montreal
school of CSR), the _C_o_n_t_i_n_e_n_t_a_l_ _E_u_r_o_p_e_a_n and the _A_n_g_l_o_-_S_a_x_o_n approaches to CSR.
_[_9_] And even within Europe the discussion about CSR is very heterogeneous._[_1_0_]
A more common approach to CSR is corporate _p_h_i_l_a_n_t_h_r_o_p_y. This includes monetary
donations and aid given to local and non-local nonprofit organizations and
communities, including donations in areas such as the arts, education, housing,
health, social welfare, and the environment, among others, but excluding
political contributions and commercial sponsorship of events._[_1_1_] Some
organizations[_w_h_o_?] do not like a philanthropy-based approach as it might not
help build on the skills of local populations, whereas community-based
development generally leads to more sustainable development.[_c_l_a_r_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n

Another approach to CSR is to incorporate the CSR strategy directly into the
business strategy of an organization. For instance, procurement of _F_a_i_r_ _T_r_a_d_e
tea and coffee has been adopted by various businesses including _K_P_M_G. Its CSR
manager commented, "Fairtrade fits very strongly into our commitment to our
communities."_[_1_2_]
Another approach is garnering increasing corporate responsibility interest.
This is called _C_r_e_a_t_i_n_g_ _S_h_a_r_e_d_ _V_a_l_u_e, or CSV. The shared value model is based
on the idea that corporate success and social welfare are interdependent. A
business needs a healthy, educated workforce, sustainable resources and adept
government to compete effectively. For society to thrive, profitable and
competitive businesses must be developed and supported to create income,
wealth, tax revenues, and opportunities for philanthropy. CSV received global
attention in the Harvard Business Review article Strategy & Society: The Link
between Competitive Advantage and Corporate Social Responsibility [1] by
Michael E. Porter, a leading authority on competitive strategy and head of the
Institute for Strategy and Competitiveness at Harvard Business School; and Mark
R. Kramer, Senior Fellow at the Kennedy School at Harvard University and co-
founder of FSG Social Impact Advisors. The article provides insights and
relevant examples of companies that have developed deep linkages between their
business strategies and corporate social responsibility. Many approaches to CSR
pit businesses against society, emphasizing the costs and limitations of
compliance with externally imposed social and environmental standards. CSV
acknowledges trade-offs between short-term profitability and social or
environmental goals, but focuses more on the opportunities for competitive
advantage from building a social value proposition into corporate strategy. CSV
has a limitation in that it gives the impression that only two stakeholders are
important - shareholders and consumers - and belies the multi-stakeholder
approach of most CSR advocates.
Many companies use the strategy of benchmarking to compete within their
respective industries in CSR policy, implementation, and effectiveness.
Benchmarking involves reviewing competitor CSR initiatives, as well as
measuring and evaluating the impact that those policies have on society and the
environment, and how customers perceive competitor CSR strategy. After a
comprehensive study of competitor strategy and an internal policy review
performed, a comparison can be drawn and a strategy developed for competition
with CSR initiatives.

In competitive markets the cost-benefit analysis regarding positive financial
outcomes upon implementing a CSR-based strategy, can be examined with a lens of
the resource-based-view (RBV) of sustainable competitive advantage. According
to Barney‚Äôs (1990) "formulation of the RBV, sustainable competitive advantage
requires that resources be valuable (V), rare (R), inimitable (I) and non-
substitutable (S)."_[_1_3_]_[_1_4_] A firm can conduct a cost benefit analysis through
a RBV-based lens to determine the optimal and appropriate level of investment
in CSR, as it would with any other investments. A firm introducing a CSR-based
strategy might only sustain high returns on their investment if their CSR-based
strategy were inimitable (I) by their competitors. In competitive markets, a
firm introducing a CSR-based strategy might only sustain high returns on their
investment and there may only be a short-lived strategic competitive advantage
to implementing CSR as their competitors may adopt similar strategies. There is
however, a long-term advantage in that competitors may also imitate CSR-based
strategies in a socially responsible way. Even if a firm chooses CSR for
strategic financial gain, the firm is also acting responsibly._[_3_] Attention to
CSR as an element in corporate strategy led to examining CSR activities through
the lens of the resource-based-view (RBV) of the firm. The RBV, as introduced
by Wernerfelt (1984) and refined by Barney (1991), presumes that firms are
bundles of heterogeneous resources and capabilities that are imperfectly mobile
across firms. Accordingly, the imperfect mobility of heterogeneous resources
can result in competitive advantages for firms that have superior resources or
capabilities. McWilliams and Siegel (2001) used a model based on RBV to address
optimal investment in CSR. In their model, CSR activities and attributes may be
used in a differentiation strategy. They conclude that managers can determine
the appropriate level of investment in CSR by conducting cost benefit analysis
in the same way that they analyze other investments. Applying the RBV to CSR
naturally leads to the question of whether firms can use CSR to achieve a
sustainable competitive advantage. Reinhardt (1998) addressed this issue and
found that a firm engaging in a CSR-based strategy could only sustain an
abnormal return if it could prevent competitors from imitating its strategy.

For a business to take responsibility for its actions, that business must be
fully accountable. _S_o_c_i_a_l_ _a_c_c_o_u_n_t_i_n_g, a concept describing the communication of
social and environmental effects of a company's economic actions to particular
interest groups within society and to society at large, is thus an important
element of CSR._[_1_6_]
Social accounting emphasizes the notion of corporate _a_c_c_o_u_n_t_a_b_i_l_i_t_y. D.
Crowther defines social accounting in this sense as "an approach to reporting a
firm‚Äôs activities which stresses the need for the identification of socially
relevant behavior, the determination of those to whom the company is
accountable for its social performance and the development of appropriate
measures and reporting techniques."_[_1_7_] An example of social accounting, to a
limited extent, is found in an annual _D_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_'_s_ _R_e_p_o_r_t, under the requirements

‚ÄúSocial license‚Äù generally refers to a local community‚Äôs acceptance or
approval of a company‚Äôs project or ongoing presence in an area. It is
increasingly recognized by various stakeholders and communities as a
prerequisite to development. The development of social license occurs outside
of formal permitting or regulatory processes, and requires sustained investment
by proponents to acquire and maintain social capital within the context of
trust-based relationships. Often intangible and informal, social license can
nevertheless be realized through a robust suite of actions centered on timely
and effective communication, meaningful dialogue, and ethical and responsible
behavior.
Local conditions, needs, and customs vary considerably and are often opaque,
but have a significant impact on the likely success of various approaches to
building social capital and trust. These regional and cultural differences
demand a flexible and responsive approach and must be understood early in order
to enable the development and implementation of an effective strategy to earn
and maintain social license. Governments could facilitate the necessary
stakeholder mapping in regions for which they are responsible and provide a
regulatory framework that sets companies on the right path for engagement with
communities and stakeholders. Social media tools empower stakeholders and
communities to access and share information on company behaviors, technologies,
and projects as they are implemented around the world. Understanding and
managing this reality will be important for companies seeking social license.
Voluntary measures integral to corporate-responsibility frameworks contribute
to achieving social license, particularly through enhancing a company‚Äôs
reputation and strengthening its capacity for effective communication,
engagement, and collaboration. However, such measures do not obviate the need
for project-specific action to earn and maintain social license. The growing
reliance on social media tools by stakeholders and proponents alike, and the
risks associated with disclosure through them, may lead to an increase._[_2_2_]

The scale and nature of the benefits of CSR for an organization can vary
depending on the nature of the enterprise, and are difficult to quantify,
though there is a large body of literature exhorting business to adopt measures
beyond financial ones (e.g., _D_e_m_i_n_g's Fourteen Points, _b_a_l_a_n_c_e_d_ _s_c_o_r_e_c_a_r_d_s).
Orlitzky, Schmidt, and Rynes_[_2_3_] found a correlation between social/
environmental performance and financial performance. However, businesses may
not be looking at short-run financial returns when developing their CSR
strategy. Intel employs a 5-year CSR planning cycle._[_2_4_]
The definition of CSR used within an organization can vary from the strict

include _c_h_a_r_i_t_a_b_l_e_ _e_f_f_o_r_t_s and _v_o_l_u_n_t_e_e_r_i_n_g. CSR may be based within the _h_u_m_a_n

Businesses are constantly relying on suppliers to reduce overall costs, while
improving the _q_u_a_l_i_t_y of their goods or services. Many North American companies
have downgraded the volume of suppliers they do business with, and award
contracts to a select few, in order to lower operating costs. By establishing a
strong _s_u_p_p_l_y_ _c_h_a_i_n, companies are able to push for continuous quality

of society and a hindrance to human freedom. They claim that the type of
capitalism practiced in many developing countries is a form of economic and
_c_u_l_t_u_r_a_l_ _i_m_p_e_r_i_a_l_i_s_m, noting that these countries usually have fewer labour
protections, and thus their citizens are at a higher risk of exploitation by
multinational corporations._[_3_6_]
A wide variety of individuals and organizations operate in between these poles.
For example, the REALeadership Alliance asserts that the business of leadership
(be it corporate or otherwise) is to change the world for the better._[_3_7_] Many
religious and cultural traditions hold that the economy exists to serve human
beings, so all economic entities have an obligation to society (see for example
_E_c_o_n_o_m_i_c_ _J_u_s_t_i_c_e_ _f_o_r_ _A_l_l). Moreover, as discussed above, many CSR proponents
point out that CSR can significantly improve long-term corporate profitability
because it reduces risks and inefficiencies while offering a host of potential
benefits such as enhanced brand reputation and _e_m_p_l_o_y_e_e_ _e_n_g_a_g_e_m_e_n_t.

Some critics believe that CSR programs are undertaken by companies such as
_B_r_i_t_i_s_h_ _A_m_e_r_i_c_a_n_ _T_o_b_a_c_c_o (BAT),_[_3_8_] the petroleum giant _B_P (well known for its
high-profile advertising campaigns on environmental aspects of its operations),
and _M_c_D_o_n_a_l_d_'_s (see below) to distract the public from ethical questions posed
by their core operations. They argue that some corporations start CSR programs
for the commercial benefit they enjoy through raising their reputation with the
public or with government. They suggest that corporations which exist solely to
maximize profits are unable to advance the interests of society as a whole._[_3_9_]
Another concern is that sometimes companies claim to promote CSR and be
committed to _s_u_s_t_a_i_n_a_b_l_e_ _d_e_v_e_l_o_p_m_e_n_t but simultaneously engage in harmful
business practices. For example, since the 1970s, the _M_c_D_o_n_a_l_d_'_s_ _C_o_r_p_o_r_a_t_i_o_n's

marketing. More recently, as CSR has become mainstream, the company has beefed
up its CSR programs related to its labor, environmental and other practices_[_4_0_]

the very real risk of _h_e_a_r_t_ _d_i_s_e_a_s_e.'_[_4_2_]
_R_o_y_a_l_ _D_u_t_c_h_ _S_h_e_l_l has a much-publicized CSR policy and was a pioneer in _t_r_i_p_l_e
_b_o_t_t_o_m_ _l_i_n_e reporting, but this did not prevent the 2004 scandal concerning its
misreporting of _o_i_l_ _r_e_s_e_r_v_e_s, which seriously damaged its reputation and led to
charges of hypocrisy. Since then, the Shell Foundation has become involved in
many projects across the world, including a partnership with _M_a_r_k_s_ _a_n_d_ _S_p_e_n_c_e_r
(UK) in three flower and fruit growing communities across Africa.
Critics concerned with corporate hypocrisy and insincerity generally suggest
that better governmental and international regulation and enforcement, rather
than voluntary measures, are necessary to ensure that companies behave in a
socially responsible manner. A major area of necessary international regulation
is the reduction of the capacity of corporations to sue states under _i_n_v_e_s_t_o_r
_s_t_a_t_e_ _d_i_s_p_u_t_e_ _s_e_t_t_l_e_m_e_n_t provisions in trade or investment treaties if
otherwise necessary public health or environment protection legislation has
impeded corporate investments._[_4_3_] Others, such as Patricia Werhane, argue that
CSR should be considered more as a corporate moral responsibility, and limit
the reach of CSR by focusing more on direct impacts of the organization as
viewed through a systems perspective to identify stakeholders. For a commonly
overlooked motive for CSR, see also _C_o_r_p_o_r_a_t_e_ _S_o_c_i_a_l_ _E_n_t_r_e_p_r_e_n_e_u_r_s_h_i_p, whereby
CSR can also be driven by employees' personal values, in addition to the more
obvious economic and governmental drivers.

Cohen 2005, 147). Industrialization, in many developing countries, is booming
as a result of both technology and globalization. Consumers are becoming more
aware of the environmental and social implications of their day-to-day consumer
decisions and are therefore beginning to make purchasing decisions related to
their environmental and ethical concerns._[_4_4_] However, this practice is far

As corporations pursue growth through _g_l_o_b_a_l_i_z_a_t_i_o_n, they have encountered new
challenges that impose limits to their growth and potential profits. Government
regulations, _t_a_r_i_f_f_s, environmental restrictions and varying standards of what
constitutes "labor exploitation" are problems that can cost organizations
millions of dollars. Some view ethical issues as simply a costly hindrance,
while some companies use CSR methodologies as a strategic tactic to gain public
support for their presence in global markets, helping them sustain a
competitive advantage by using their social contributions to provide a
subconscious level of advertising. (Fry, Keim, Meiners 1986, 105) Global
competition places a particular pressure on multinational corporations to
examine not only their own labor practices, but those of their entire supply
chain, from a CSR perspective. that all government is controlling.

The role among corporate stakeholders is to work collectively to pressure
corporations that are changing. Shareholders and investors themselves, through

responsibly. The extension of SRI bodies driving corporations to include an
element of ‚Äòethical investment‚Äô into their corporate agenda‚Äôs generates
socially embedded issues. The main issue correlates to the development and
overall idea of ‚Äòethical investing‚Äô or SRI, a concept that is constructed
as a general social perspective._[_4_5_] The problem becomes defining what is
classified as ‚Äòethical investing‚Äô. The ethics or values of one SRI body
will likely different from the next since ethical opinions are inherently
paradoxical. For example, some religious investors in the US have withdrawn
investment from companies that fail to fulfill their ethical expectations._[_4_5_]

The rise of ethics training inside corporations, some of it required by
government regulation, is another driver credited with changing the behavior
and culture of corporations. The aim of such training is to help employees make
ethical decisions when the answers are unclear. Tullberg believes that humans
are built with the capacity to cheat and manipulate, a view taken from Trivers
(1971, 1985), hence the need for learning normative values and rules in human
behavior._[_4_7_] The most direct benefit is reducing the likelihood of "dirty
hands" (Grace and Cohen 2005), fines and damaged reputations for breaching laws
or moral norms. Organizations also see secondary benefit in increasing employee
loyalty and pride in the organization[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]. _C_a_t_e_r_p_i_l_l_a_r and _B_e_s_t
_B_u_y are examples of organizations that have taken such steps._[_4_8_]
Increasingly, companies are becoming interested in processes that can add
visibility to their CSR policies and activities. One method that is gaining
increasing popularity is the use of well-grounded training programs, where CSR
is a major issue, and _b_u_s_i_n_e_s_s_ _s_i_m_u_l_a_t_i_o_n_s can play a part in this.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n

One relevant documentary is _T_h_e_ _C_o_r_p_o_r_a_t_i_o_n, the history of organizations and
their growth in power is discussed. Corporate social responsibility, what a
company does in trying to benefit society, versus corporate moral
responsibility (CMR), what a company should morally do, are both important
topics to consider when looking at ethics in CSR. For example, Ray Anderson, in
The Corporation, takes a CMR perspective in order to do what is moral and he
begins to shift his company's focus towards the biosphere by utilizing carpets
in sections so that they will sustain for longer periods. This is Anderson
thinking in terms of Garret Hardin's "The Tragedy of the Commons," where if
people do not pay attention to the private ways in which we use public
resources, people will eventually lose those public resources.

CSR has inspired national governments to include CSR issues into their national
public policy agendas. The increased importance driven by CSR, has prompted
governments to promote socially and environmentally responsible corporate
practices._[_5_1_] Over the past decade governments have considered CSR as a public
issue that requires national governmental involvement to address the very
issues relevant to CSR. The heightened role of government in CSR has
facilitated the development of numerous CSR programs and policies._[_5_1_]
Specifically, various European governments have implemented public policies on
CSR enhancing their competence to develop sustainable corporate practices._[_5_2_]
CSR critics such as _R_o_b_e_r_t_ _R_e_i_c_h argue that governments should set the agenda
for social responsibility by the way of laws and regulation that will allow a
business to conduct themselves responsibly. Actors engaged in CSR:
    * governments
    * corporations
    * civil societies
Recently[_w_h_e_n_?], 15 _E_u_r_o_p_e_a_n_ _U_n_i_o_n countries have actively engaged in CSR
regulation and public policy development._[_5_2_] Recognizably, the CSR efforts and
policies are vastly different amongst countries resultant to the complexity and
diversity of governments‚Äô, corporations‚Äô, and civil societies‚Äô roles.
Scholars have analyzed each body that promotes CSR based policies and programs
concluding that the role and effectiveness of these actors are case-specific.
_[_5_1_] Global issues so broadly defined such as CSR generate numerous
relationships between the different socio-geographic players.
A key debate in CSR is determining what actors are responsible to ensure that
corporation‚Äôs are behaving in a socio-economic and environmentally
sustainable manner.

The issues surrounding corporate regulation pose several problems. The concept
of regulation is inherently difficult to address because of the numerous
corporations that exist are vastly dissimilar in terms of corporate behavior
and nature. Thus, regulation in itself is unable to cover every aspect in
detail of a corporation's operations. For example, This leads to burdensome
legal processes bogged down in interpretations of the law and debatable grey
areas (Sacconi 2004). For example, _G_e_n_e_r_a_l_ _E_l_e_c_t_r_i_c failed to clean up the
_H_u_d_s_o_n_ _R_i_v_e_r after contaminating it with organic pollutants. The company
continues to argue via the legal process on assignment of liability, while the
cleanup remains stagnant. (Sullivan & Schiafo 2005). Government regulation or
public institutional regulation is difficult to achieve. Depending on the
political regime and form of government ‚Äì _d_e_m_o_c_r_a_c_y, _p_a_r_l_i_a_m_e_n_t_a_r_y,
_p_r_e_s_i_d_e_n_t_i_a_l ‚Äì issues of governmental ineffectiveness may transpire. As a
result, attempts at CSR policy development and implementation may be
unattainable.
The second issue is the financial burden that regulation can place on a
nation's economy. This view shared by Bulkeley, who cites the Australian
federal government's actions to avoid compliance with the _K_y_o_t_o_ _P_r_o_t_o_c_o_l in
1997, on the concerns of economic loss and national interest. The Australian
government took the position that signing the Kyoto Pact would have caused more
significant economic losses for Australia than for any other OECD nation
(Bulkeley 2001, pg 436). On the change of government following the election in
November 2007, Prime Minister _K_e_v_i_n_ _R_u_d_d signed the ratification immediately
after assuming office on 3 December 2007, just before the meeting of the UN
Framework Convention on Climate Change. Critics of CSR also point out that
organizations pay taxes to government to ensure that society and the
environment are not adversely affected by business activities.
The government of Canada has adopted a national position that expects Canadian
corporations to practice behaviors parallel to CSR. In 2007, _P_r_i_m_e_ _M_i_n_i_s_t_e_r
_H_a_r_p_e_r was aware of Canada‚Äôs abundant investment into the resource/mineral
extractive sector and encouraged the Canadian mining companies to meet
Canada‚Äôs newly developed CSR standards and expectations._[_5_3_] The method of
developing and implementing CSR policies was achieved through government-
company consultation and government stakeholder cooperation._[_5_3_] The successful
relationship between the CSR actors within Canada‚Äôs government and country,
may advocate that cooperation amongst constituencies is the most imperative
element to CSR regulation.
The European Union has recently[_w_h_e_n_?] done extensive work to try and find the
best form of regulation. Some critics argue that the creation of a CSR
organization with a democratically appointed minister focused solely on
monitoring and enforcing socially responsible behaviour will be extremely
effective._[_5_2_]

The laws legally binding the corporation‚Äôs behavior and activity are quite
insignificant in relation to the global consequences. Only recently have
countries included CSR policies in government agendas legislature._[_5_2_] Common
types of countries who have implemented legislation and CSR laws generally
consist of socio-economic and politically sophisticated countries. The level of
political stability and effectiveness is inextricably linked to a countries
capacity to ensure national CSR policies.

from violating human rights._[_5_5_]
_D_e_n_m_a_r_k has a law on CSR. On 16 December 2008, the Danish parliament adopted a
bill making it mandatory for the 1100 largest Danish companies, investors and
state-owned companies to include information on corporate social responsibility
(CSR) in their annual financial reports. The reporting requirements became
effective on 1 January 2009._[_5_6_] The required information includes:
    * information on the companies‚Äô policies for CSR or _s_o_c_i_a_l_l_y_ _r_e_s_p_o_n_s_i_b_l_e

    * information on how such policies are implemented in practice, and
    * information on what results have been obtained so far and managements
      expectations for the future with regard to CSR/SRI.
CSR/SRI is still voluntary in Denmark, but if a company has no policy on this
it must state its positioning on CSR in their annual financial report. More on

Often it takes a crisis to precipitate attention to CSR. One of the most active
stands against environmental mismanagement is the _C_E_R_E_S Principles that
resulted after the _E_x_x_o_n_ _V_a_l_d_e_z incident in Alaska in 1989 (Grace and Cohen
2006). Other examples include the _l_e_a_d_ _p_o_i_s_o_n_i_n_g paint used by toy giant
_M_a_t_t_e_l, which required a recall of millions of toys globally and caused the
company to initiate new risk management and quality control processes. In
another example, _M_a_g_e_l_l_a_n_ _M_e_t_a_l_s in the West Australian town of Esperance was
responsible for lead contamination killing thousands of birds in the area. The
company had to cease business immediately and work with independent regulatory
bodies to execute a cleanup. Odwalla also experienced a crisis with sales
dropping 90%, and the company's stock price dropping 34% due to several cases
of _E_._ _c_o_l_i spread through Odwalla _a_p_p_l_e juice. The company ordered a recall of
all apple or _c_a_r_r_o_t juice products and introduced a new process called "flash

Increasingly, corporations are motivated to become more socially responsible
because their most important stakeholders expect them to understand and address
the social and community issues that are relevant to them. Understanding what
causes are important to employees is usually the first priority because of the
many interrelated business benefits that can be derived from increased employee
engagement (i.e. more loyalty, improved recruitment, increased retention,
higher productivity, and so on). Key external stakeholders include customers,
consumers, investors (particularly institutional investors), communities in the
areas where the corporation operates its facilities, regulators, academics, and
the media.
Branco and Rodrigues (2007) describe the stakeholder perspective of CSR as the
inclusion of all groups or constituents (rather than just shareholders) in
managerial decision making related to the organization‚Äôs portfolio of
socially responsible activities._[_5_7_] This normative model implies that the CSR
collaborations are positively accepted when they are in the interests of
stakeholders and may have no effect or be detrimental to the organization if
they are not directly related to stakeholder interests. The stakeholder
perspective suffers from a wheel and spoke network metaphor that does not
acknowledge the complexity of network interactions that can occur in cross
sector partnerships. It also relegates communication to a maintenance function,
similar to the exchange perspective._[_5_8_]

Several industries are often absent from CSR research. The absence is due to
the presumption that these particular industries fail to achieve ethical
considerations of their consumers. Typical industries include tobacco and
alcohol producers ("sin industry" manufacturers), as well as defense firms_[_5_9_]
