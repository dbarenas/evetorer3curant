CCrreeaattiivviittyy is a phenomenon whereby something new and valuable is created (such
as an idea, a joke, a literary work, a painting or musical composition, a
solution, an invention etc.). It is also the qualitative impetus behind any
given act of creation, and it is generally perceived to be associated with
_i_n_t_e_l_l_i_g_e_n_c_e and _c_o_g_n_i_t_i_o_n.
The range of scholarly interest in creativity includes a multitude of
definitions and approaches involving several disciplines; _p_s_y_c_h_o_l_o_g_y, _c_o_g_n_i_t_i_v_e
_s_c_i_e_n_c_e, _e_d_u_c_a_t_i_o_n, _p_h_i_l_o_s_o_p_h_y (particularly _p_h_i_l_o_s_o_p_h_y_ _o_f_ _s_c_i_e_n_c_e),
_t_e_c_h_n_o_l_o_g_y, _t_h_e_o_l_o_g_y, _s_o_c_i_o_l_o_g_y, _l_i_n_g_u_i_s_t_i_c_s, _b_u_s_i_n_e_s_s_ _s_t_u_d_i_e_s, and _e_c_o_n_o_m_i_c_s,
taking in the relationship between creativity and general intelligence, mental
and neurological processes associated with creativity, the relationships
between personality type and creative ability and between creativity and mental
health, the potential for fostering creativity through education and training,
especially as augmented by technology, and the application of creative
resources to improve the effectiveness of learning and teaching processes.

In a summary of scientific research into creativity, Michael Mumford suggested:
"Over the course of the last decade, however, we seem to have reached a general
agreement that creativity involves the production of novel, useful products"
(Mumford, 2003, p. 110)._[_1_] Creativity can also be defined "as the process of
producing something that is both original and worthwhile" or "characterized by
originality and expressiveness and imaginative"._[_2_] What is produced can come
in many forms and is not specifically singled out in a subject or area. Authors
have diverged dramatically in their precise definitions beyond these general
commonalities: Peter Meusburger reckons that over a hundred different analyses
can be found in the literature._[_3_]

Theories of creativity (particularly investigation of why some people are more
creative than others) have focused on a variety of aspects. The dominant
factors are usually identified as "the four Ps" - process, product, person and
place._[_4_] A focus on process is shown in cognitive approaches that try to
describe thought mechanisms and techniques for creative thinking. Theories
invoking divergent rather than convergent thinking (such as _G_u_i_l_f_o_r_d), or those
describing the staging of the creative process (such as _W_a_l_l_a_s) are primarily
theories of creative process. A focus on creative product usually appears in
attempts to measure creativity (psychometrics, see below) and in creative ideas
framed as successful _m_e_m_e_s._[_5_] The psychometric approach to creativity reveals
that it also involves the ability to produce more._[_6_] A focus on the nature of
the creative person considers more general intellectual habits, such as
openness, levels of _i_d_e_a_t_i_o_n, autonomy, expertise, exploratory behavior and so
on. A focus on place considers the circumstances in which creativity
flourishes, such as degrees of autonomy, access to resources and the nature of
gatekeepers. Creative lifestyles are characterized by nonconforming attitudes
and behaviors as well as flexibility._[_6_]
An article by R.J. Sternberg in the Creativity Research Journal reviewed the
"investment" theory of creativity as well as the "propulsion" theory of
creative contribution, suggesting that there are eight types of creative
contribution; replication - confirming that the given field is in the correct
place - redefinition - the attempt to redefine where the field is and how it is
viewed - forward incrementation - a creative contribution that moves the field
forward in the direction in which it is already moving - advance forward
movement - which advances the field past the point where others are ready for
it to go - redirection - which moves the field in a new, different direction -
redirection from a point in the past - which moves the field back to a previous
point to advance in a different direction - starting over/ re-initiation -
moving the field to a different starting point - and integration - combining
two or more diverse ways of thinking about the field into a single way of
thinking._[_7_]

_J_a_m_e_s_ _C_._ _K_a_u_f_m_a_n and Beghetto introduced a "four C" model of creativity; mini-
c ("transformative learning" involving "personally meaningful interpretations
of experiences, actions and insights"), little-c (everyday problem solving and
creative expression), Pro-C (exhibited by people who are professionally or
vocationally creative though not necessarily eminent) and Big-C (creativity
considered great in the given field). This model was intended to help
accommodate models and theories of creativity that stressed competence as an
essential component and the historical transformation of a creative domain as
the highest mark of creativity. It also, the authors argued, made a useful
framework for analysing creative processes in individuals._[_8_]
The contrast of terms "Big C" and "Little c" has been widely used. Kozbelt,
Beghetto and Runco use a little-c/Big-C model to review major theories of
creativity _[_4_] _M_a_r_g_a_r_e_t_ _B_o_d_e_n distinguishes between h-creativity (historical)

The _l_e_x_e_m_e in the English word creativity comes from the _L_a_t_i_n term cre≈ç "to

Most ancient cultures, including thinkers of _A_n_c_i_e_n_t_ _G_r_e_e_c_e,_[_1_6_] _A_n_c_i_e_n_t_ _C_h_i_n_a,
and _A_n_c_i_e_n_t_ _I_n_d_i_a,_[_1_7_] lacked the concept of creativity, seeing art as a form
of discovery and not creation. The _a_n_c_i_e_n_t_ _G_r_e_e_k_s had no terms corresponding to
"to create" or "creator" except for the expression "poiein" ("to make"), which
only applied to poiesis (poetry) and to the poietes (poet, or "maker") who made
it. _P_l_a_t_o did not believe in art as a form of creation. Asked in _T_h_e_ _R_e_p_u_b_l_i_c,
_[_1_8_] "Will we say, of a painter, that he makes something?", he answers,
"Certainly not, he merely _i_m_i_t_a_t_e_s."_[_1_6_]
It is commonly argued that the notion of "creativity" originated in Western
culture through Christianity, as a matter of _d_i_v_i_n_e_ _i_n_s_p_i_r_a_t_i_o_n._[_1_4_] According
to the historian _D_a_n_i_e_l_ _J_._ _B_o_o_r_s_t_i_n, "the early Western conception of
creativity was the Biblical story of creation given in the Genesis."_[_1_9_]
However, this is not creativity in the modern sense, which did not arise until
the _R_e_n_a_i_s_s_a_n_c_e. In the Judaeo-Christian tradition, creativity was the sole
province of God; humans were not considered to have the ability to create
something new except as an expression of God's work._[_2_0_] A concept similar to
that of Christianity existed in Greek culture, for instance, _M_u_s_e_s were seen as
mediating inspiration from the Gods._[_2_1_] Romans and Greeks invoked the concept
of an external creative "_d_a_e_m_o_n" (Greek) or "_g_e_n_i_u_s" (Latin), linked to the
sacred or the divine. However, none of these views are similar to the modern
concept of creativity, and the individual was not seen as the cause of creation
until the _R_e_n_a_i_s_s_a_n_c_e._[_2_2_] It was during the Renaissance that creativity was
first seen, not as a conduit for the divine, but from the abilities of "_g_r_e_a_t
_m_e_n"._[_2_2_]

The rejection of creativity in favor of discovery and the belief that
individual creation was a conduit of the divine would dominate the West
probably until the _R_e_n_a_i_s_s_a_n_c_e and even later._[_2_0_] The development of the
modern concept of creativity begins in the _R_e_n_a_i_s_s_a_n_c_e, when creation began to
be perceived as having originated from the abilities of the individual, and not
God. However, this shift was gradual and would not become immediately apparent
until the Enlightenment._[_2_2_] By the 18th century and the _A_g_e_ _o_f_ _E_n_l_i_g_h_t_e_n_m_e_n_t,
mention of creativity (notably in art theory), linked with the concept of
_i_m_a_g_i_n_a_t_i_o_n, became more frequent._[_2_3_] In the writing of _T_h_o_m_a_s_ _H_o_b_b_e_s,
imagination became a key element of human cognition;_[_1_4_] _W_i_l_l_i_a_m_ _D_u_f_f was one
of the first to identify imagination as a quality of _g_e_n_i_u_s, typifying the
separation being made between talent (productive, but breaking no new ground)
and genius._[_2_1_]
As a direct and independent topic of study, creativity effectively received no
attention until the 19th century._[_2_1_] Runco and Albert argue that creativity as
the subject of proper study began seriously to emerge in the late 19th century
with the increased interest in individual differences inspired by the arrival
of _D_a_r_w_i_n_i_s_m. In particular they refer to the work of _F_r_a_n_c_i_s_ _G_a_l_t_o_n, who
through his _e_u_g_e_n_i_c_i_s_t outlook took a keen interest in the heritability of
intelligence, with creativity taken as an aspect of genius._[_1_4_]
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, leading mathematicians and
scientists such as _H_e_r_m_a_n_n_ _v_o_n_ _H_e_l_m_h_o_l_t_z (1896) and _H_e_n_r_i_ _P_o_i_n_c_a_r_√_© (1908)
began to reflect on and publicly discuss their creative processes.

The insights of Poincar√© and von Helmholtz were built on in early accounts of
the creative process by pioneering theorists such as _G_r_a_h_a_m_ _W_a_l_l_a_s_[_2_4_] and _M_a_x
_W_e_r_t_h_e_i_m_e_r. In his work Art of Thought, published in 1926, Wallas presented one
of the first models of the creative process. In the Wallas stage model,
creative insights and illuminations may be explained by a process consisting of
5 stages:
      (i) preparation (preparatory work on a problem that focuses the
      individual's mind on the problem and explores the problem's dimensions),
      (ii) incubation (where the problem is internalized into the unconscious
      mind and nothing appears externally to be happening),
      (iii) intimation (the creative person gets a "feeling" that a solution is
      on its way),
      (iv) illumination or insight (where the creative idea bursts forth from
      its _p_r_e_c_o_n_s_c_i_o_u_s processing into conscious awareness); and
      (v) verification (where the idea is consciously verified, elaborated, and
      then applied).
Wallas' model is often treated as four stages, with "intimation" seen as a sub-
stage.
Wallas considered creativity to be a legacy of the _e_v_o_l_u_t_i_o_n_a_r_y process, which
allowed humans to quickly adapt to rapidly changing environments. Simonton_[_2_5_]
provides an updated perspective on this view in his book, Origins of genius:
Darwinian perspectives on creativity.
In 1927, _A_l_f_r_e_d_ _N_o_r_t_h_ _W_h_i_t_e_h_e_a_d gave the Gifford Lectures at the University of
Edinburgh, later published as Process and Reality._[_2_6_] He is credited with
having coined the term "creativity" to serve as the ultimate category of his
metaphysical scheme: "Whitehead actually coined the term ‚Äì our term, still
the preferred currency of exchange among literature, science, and the arts. . .
a term that quickly became so popular, so omnipresent, that its invention
within living memory, and by Alfred North Whitehead of all people, quickly
became occluded"._[_2_7_]
The formal _p_s_y_c_h_o_m_e_t_r_i_c measurement of creativity, from the standpoint of
orthodox _p_s_y_c_h_o_l_o_g_i_c_a_l literature, is usually considered to have begun with _J_.
_P_._ _G_u_i_l_f_o_r_d's 1950 address to the _A_m_e_r_i_c_a_n_ _P_s_y_c_h_o_l_o_g_i_c_a_l_ _A_s_s_o_c_i_a_t_i_o_n, which
helped popularize the topic_[_2_8_] and focus attention on a scientific approach to
conceptualizing creativity. (It should be noted that the London School of
Psychology had instigated psychometric studies of creativity as early as 1927
with the work of H. L. Hargreaves into the Faculty of Imagination,_[_2_9_] but it
did not have the same impact.) Statistical analysis led to the recognition of
creativity(as measured) as a separate aspect of human cognition to _I_Q-type
intelligence, into which it had previously been subsumed. Guilford's work
suggested that above a threshold level of IQ, the relationship between
creativity and classically measured intelligence broke down._[_4_]

Incubation is a temporary break from creative problem solving that can result
in insight._[_3_0_] There has been some empirical research looking at whether, as
the concept of "incubation" in Wallas' model implies, a period of interruption
or rest from a problem may aid creative problem-solving. Ward_[_3_1_] lists various
hypotheses that have been advanced to explain why incubation may aid creative
problem-solving, and notes how some _e_m_p_i_r_i_c_a_l_ _e_v_i_d_e_n_c_e is consistent with the
hypothesis that incubation aids creative problem-solving in that it enables
"forgetting" of misleading clues. Absence of incubation may lead the problem
solver to become _f_i_x_a_t_e_d on inappropriate strategies of solving the problem.
_[_3_2_] This work disputes the earlier hypothesis that creative solutions to
problems arise mysteriously from the unconscious mind while the conscious mind
is occupied on other tasks._[_3_3_]

In 1992, Finke et al. proposed the "Geneplore" model, in which creativity takes
place in two phases: a generative phase, where an individual constructs mental
representations called preinventive structures, and an exploratory phase where
those structures are used to come up with creative ideas. Some evidence shows
that when people use their imagination to develop new ideas, those ideas are
heavily structured in predictable ways by the properties of existing categories
and concepts._[_3_5_] Weisberg_[_3_6_] argued, by contrast, that creativity only
involves ordinary cognitive processes yielding extraordinary results.

Helie and Sun_[_3_7_] recently proposed a unified framework for understanding

theory of creativity. This new theory constitutes an attempt at providing a
more unified explanation of relevant phenomena (in part by reinterpreting/
integrating various fragmentary existing theories of _i_n_c_u_b_a_t_i_o_n and _i_n_s_i_g_h_t).
The EII theory relies mainly on five basic principles, namely 1) The co-
existence of and the difference between explicit and implicit knowledge; 2) The
simultaneous involvement of implicit and explicit processes in most tasks; 3)
The redundant representation of explicit and implicit knowledge; 4) The
integration of the results of explicit and implicit processing; and 5) The
iterative (and possibly bidirectional) processing. A computational
implementation of the theory was developed based on the _C_L_A_R_I_O_N_ _c_o_g_n_i_t_i_v_e
_a_r_c_h_i_t_e_c_t_u_r_e and used to simulate relevant human data. This work represents an
initial step in the development of process-based theories of creativity
encompassing incubation, insight, and various other related phenomena.

Honing theory posits that creativity arises due to the self-organizing, self-
mending nature of a worldview, and that it is by way of the creative process
the individual hones (and re-hones) an integrated worldview. Honing theory
places equal emphasis on the externally visible creative outcome and the
internal cognitive restructuring brought about by the creative process. Indeed
one factor that distinguishes it from other theories of creativity is that it
focuses on not just restructuring as it pertains to the conception of the task,
but as it pertains to the worldview as a whole. When faced with a creatively
demanding task, there is an interaction between the conception of the task and
the worldview. The conception of the task changes through interaction with the
worldview, and the worldview changes through interaction with the task. This
interaction is reiterated until the task is complete, at which point not only
is the task conceived of differently, but the worldview is subtly or
drastically transformed. Thus another distinguishing feature of honing theory
is that the creative process reflects the natural tendency of a worldview to
attempt to resolve dissonance and seek internal consistency amongst its
components, whether they be ideas, attitudes, or bits of knowledge; it mends
itself as does a body when it has been injured.
Yet another central, distinguishing feature of honing theory is the notion of a
potentiality state._[_3_9_] Honing theory posits that creative thought proceeds not
by searching through and randomly ‚Äòmutating‚Äô predefined possibilities, but
by drawing upon associations that exist due to overlap in the distributed
neural cell assemblies that participate in the encoding of experiences in
memory. Midway through the creative process one may have made associations
between the current task and previous experiences, but not yet disambiguated
which aspects of those previous experiences are relevant to the current task.
Thus the creative idea may feel ‚Äòhalf-baked‚Äô. It is at that point that it
can be said to be in a potentiality state, because how it will actualize
depends on the different internally or externally generated contexts it
interacts with.
Honing theory can account for many phenomena that are not readily explained by
other theories of creativity. For example, creativity was commonly thought to
be fostered by a supportive, nurturing, trustworthy environment conducive to
self-actualization. However, research shows that creativity is actually
associated with childhood adversity, which would stimulate honing. Honing
theory also makes several predictions that differ from what would be predicted
by other theories. For example, empirical support has been obtained using
analogy problem solving experiments for the proposal that midway through the
creative process one's mind is in a potentiality state. Other experiments show
that different works by the same creator exhibit a recognizable style or
'voice', and that this same recognizable quality even comes through in
different creative outlets. This is not predicted by theories of creativity
that emphasize chance processes or the accumulation of expertise, but it is
predicted by honing theory, according to which personal style reflects the
creator's uniquely structured worldview. This theory has been developed by
_L_i_a_n_e_ _G_a_b_o_r_a.

mentioning of a "divergence test". As opposed to "convergence tests", where a
test taker is asked to sort through a list of possibilities and converge on the
right answer, a divergence test requires one to use imagination and take one's
mind in as many different directions as possible. "With a divergence test,
obviously there isn't a single right answer. What the test giver is looking for
are the number and uniqueness of your responses. And what the test is measuring
isn't analytical intelligence but something profoundly different -- something
much closer to creativity. Divergence tests are every bit as challenging as
convergence tests."

      to write original titles.
    * Quick Responses is a word-association test scored for uncommonness.
    * Figure Concepts, where participants were given simple drawings of objects

      by two or more drawings; these were scored for uncommonness.
    * Unusual Uses is finding unusual uses for common everyday objects such as
      bricks.
    * Remote Associations, where participants are asked to find a word between
      two given words (e.g. Hand _____ Call)
    * Remote Consequences, where participants are asked to generate a list of

Some researchers have taken a social-personality approach to the measurement of
creativity. In these studies, personality traits such as independence of
judgement, self-confidence, attraction to complexity, aesthetic orientation and
risk-taking are used as measures of the creativity of individuals._[_2_8_] A _m_e_t_a_-
_a_n_a_l_y_s_i_s by Gregory Feist showed that creative people tend to be "more open to
new experiences, less conventional and less conscientious, more self-confident,
self-accepting, driven, ambitious, dominant, hostile,and impulsive." Openness,
conscientiousness, self-acceptance, hostility and impulsivity had the strongest
effects of the traits listed._[_5_0_] Within the framework of the _B_i_g_ _F_i_v_e model of

subtle differences between different domains of creativity. Compared to non-
artists, artists tend to have higher levels of openness to experience and lower
levels of conscientiousness, while scientists are more open to experience,
_c_o_n_s_c_i_e_n_t_i_o_u_s, and higher in the confidence-dominance facets of extraversion

There has been debate in the psychological literature about whether
_i_n_t_e_l_l_i_g_e_n_c_e (as measured by IQ) and creativity are part of the same process
(the conjoint hypothesis) or represent distinct mental processes (the disjoint
hypothesis). Evidence from attempts to look at correlations between
intelligence and creativity from the 1950s onwards, by authors such as Barron,
Guilford or Wallach and Kogan, regularly suggested that correlations between
these concepts were low enough to justify treating them as distinct concepts.
_[_5_1_]
Some researchers believe that creativity is the outcome of the same cognitive
processes as intelligence, and is only judged as creativity in terms of its
consequences, i.e. when the outcome of cognitive processes happens to produce
something novel, a view which Perkins has termed the "nothing special"
hypothesis._[_5_8_]
An often cited model is what has come to be known as "the threshold
hypothesis," proposed by _E_l_l_i_s_ _P_a_u_l_ _T_o_r_r_a_n_c_e, which holds that a high degree of
intelligence appears to be a _n_e_c_e_s_s_a_r_y_ _b_u_t_ _n_o_t_ _s_u_f_f_i_c_i_e_n_t_ _c_o_n_d_i_t_i_o_n for high
creativity._[_3_4_] That is, while there is a positive _c_o_r_r_e_l_a_t_i_o_n between
creativity and intelligence, this correlation disappears for IQs above a
threshold of around 120. Such a model has found acceptance by many researchers,
although it has not gone unchallenged._[_5_9_] A study in 1962 by Getzels and
Jackson among high school students concluded that high IQ and high creativity
tend to be _m_u_t_u_a_l_l_y_ _e_x_c_l_u_s_i_v_e with a majority of the highest scoring students
being either highly creative or highly intelligent, but not both. While this
explains the threshold, the exact interaction between creativity and IQ remains
unexplained._[_6_0_] A 2005 _m_e_t_a_-_A_n_a_l_y_s_i_s found only small correlations between IQ
and creativity tests and did not support the threshold theory._[_6_1_]
An alternative perspective, Renzulli's three-rings hypothesis, sees _g_i_f_t_e_d_n_e_s_s
as based on both intelligence and creativity.
Another view is that creativity may be particularly related to _f_l_u_i_d
_i_n_t_e_l_l_i_g_e_n_c_e._[_6_2_]

The _n_e_u_r_o_b_i_o_l_o_g_y of creativity has been addressed_[_6_3_] in the article "Creative
Innovation: Possible Brain Mechanisms." The authors write that "creative
innovation might require coactivation and communication between regions of the
brain that ordinarily are not strongly connected." Highly creative people who
excel at creative innovation tend to differ from others in three ways:
    * they have a high level of specialized knowledge,
    * they are capable of _d_i_v_e_r_g_e_n_t_ _t_h_i_n_k_i_n_g mediated by the _f_r_o_n_t_a_l_ _l_o_b_e.
    * and they are able to modulate _n_e_u_r_o_t_r_a_n_s_m_i_t_t_e_r_s such as _n_o_r_e_p_i_n_e_p_h_r_i_n_e in
      their frontal lobe.
Thus, the frontal lobe appears to be the part of the _c_o_r_t_e_x that is most
important for creativity.
This article also explored the links between creativity and sleep, _m_o_o_d and
_a_d_d_i_c_t_i_o_n_ _d_i_s_o_r_d_e_r_s, and _d_e_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n.
In 2005, Alice Flaherty presented a three-factor model of the creative drive.
Drawing from evidence in brain imaging, drug studies and lesion analysis, she
described the creative drive as resulting from an interaction of the frontal
lobes, the _t_e_m_p_o_r_a_l_ _l_o_b_e_s, and _d_o_p_a_m_i_n_e from the _l_i_m_b_i_c_ _s_y_s_t_e_m. The frontal
lobes can be seen as responsible for idea generation, and the temporal lobes
for idea editing and evaluation. Abnormalities in the frontal lobe (such as
depression or anxiety) generally decrease creativity, while abnormalities in
the temporal lobe often increase creativity. High activity in the temporal lobe
typically inhibits activity in the frontal lobe, and vice versa. High dopamine
levels increase general _a_r_o_u_s_a_l and goal directed behaviors and reduce _l_a_t_e_n_t
_i_n_h_i_b_i_t_i_o_n, and all three effects increase the drive to generate ideas._[_6_4_]

Vandervert_[_6_5_] described how the brain's frontal lobes and the cognitive
functions of the _c_e_r_e_b_e_l_l_u_m collaborate to produce creativity and innovation.
Vandervert's explanation rests on considerable evidence that all processes of
_w_o_r_k_i_n_g_ _m_e_m_o_r_y (responsible for processing all thought_[_6_6_]) are adaptively
modeled for increased efficiency by the cerebellum._[_6_7_] The cerebellum
(consisting of 100 billion neurons, which is more than the entirety of the rest
of the brain_[_6_8_]) is also widely known to adaptively model all bodily movement
for efficiency. The cerebellum's adaptive models of working memory processing
are then fed back to especially frontal lobe working memory control processes
_[_6_9_] where creative and innovative thoughts arise._[_7_0_] (Apparently, creative
insight or the "aha" experience is then triggered in the temporal lobe._[_7_1_])
According to Vandervert, the details of creative adaptation begin in "forward"
cerebellar models which are anticipatory/exploratory controls for movement and
thought. These cerebellar processing and control architectures have been termed
Hierarchical Modular Selection and Identification for Control (HMOSAIC)._[_7_2_]
New, hierarchically arranged levels of the cerebellar control architecture
(HMOSAIC) develop as mental mulling in working memory is extended over time.
These new levels of the control architecture are fed forward to the frontal
lobes. Since the cerebellum adaptively models all movement and all levels of
thought and emotion,_[_7_3_] Vandervert's approach helps explain creativity and
innovation in sports, art, music, the design of video games, technology,
mathematics, the _c_h_i_l_d_ _p_r_o_d_i_g_y, and thought in general.
Essentially, Vandervert has argued that when a person is confronted with a
challenging new situation, visual-spatial working memory and speech-related
working memory are decomposed and re-composed (fractionated) by the cerebellum
and then blended in the cerebral cortex in an attempt to deal with the new
situation. With repeated attempts to deal with challenging situations, the
cerebro-cerebellar blending process continues to optimize the efficiency of how
working memory deals with the situation or problem._[_7_4_] Most recently, he has
argued that this is the same process (only involving visual-spatial working
memory and pre-language vocalization) that led to the evolution of language in
humans._[_7_5_] Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers have pointed out that this
blending process, because it continuously optimizes efficiencies, constantly
improves prototyping attempts toward the invention or innovation of new ideas,
music, art, or technology._[_7_6_] Prototyping, they argue, not only produces new
products, it trains the cerebro-cerebellar pathways involved to become more
efficient at prototyping itself. Further, Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers
believe that this repetitive "mental prototyping" or mental rehearsal involving
the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex explains the success of the self-driven,
individualized patterning of repetitions initiated by the teaching methods of
the _K_h_a_n_ _A_c_a_d_e_m_y.

that occurs during REM sleep._[_7_8_] During this period of sleep, high levels of
acetylcholine in the _h_i_p_p_o_c_a_m_p_u_s suppress feedback from the hippocampus to the
_n_e_o_c_o_r_t_e_x, and lower levels of acetylcholine and norepinephrine in the
neocortex encourage the spread of associational activity within neocortical
areas without control from the hippocampus._[_8_0_] This is in contrast to waking
consciousness, where higher levels of norepinephrine and acetylcholine inhibit
recurrent connections in the neocortex. It is proposed that REM sleep adds
creativity by allowing "neocortical structures to reorganize associative
hierarchies, in which information from the hippocampus would be reinterpreted
in relation to previous semantic representations or nodes."_[_7_8_]

Some theories suggest that creativity may be particularly susceptible to
affective influence. As noted in _v_o_t_i_n_g_ _b_e_h_a_v_i_o_r the term "affect" in this
context can refer to liking or disliking key aspects of the subject in

ways in which affective states are involved in human judgment and decision-
making._[_8_1_]

According to _A_l_i_c_e_ _I_s_e_n, positive affect has three primary effects on cognitive
activity:
   1. Positive affect makes additional cognitive material available for
      processing, increasing the number of cognitive elements available for
      association;
   2. Positive affect leads to defocused attention and a more complex cognitive
      context, increasing the breadth of those elements that are treated as
      relevant to the problem;
   3. Positive affect increases cognitive flexibility, increasing the
      probability that diverse cognitive elements will in fact become
      associated. Together, these processes lead positive affect to have a
      positive influence on creativity.

emotions such as joy and love broaden a person's available repertoire of
cognitions and actions, thus enhancing creativity.
According to these researchers, positive emotions increase the number of
cognitive elements available for association (attention scope) and the number
of elements that are relevant to the problem (cognitive scope).
Various meta-analyses, such as Baas et al. (2008) of 66 studies about
creativity and affect support the link between creativity and positive affect

On the other hand, some theorists have suggested that negative affect leads to
greater creativity. A cornerstone of this perspective is empirical evidence of
a relationship between affective illness and creativity. In a study of 1,005
prominent 20th century individuals from over 45 different professions, the
University of Kentucky's Arnold Ludwig found a slight but significant
correlation between _d_e_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n and level of creative achievement. In addition,
several systematic studies of highly creative individuals and their relatives
have uncovered a higher incidence of affective disorders (primarily _b_i_p_o_l_a_r
_d_i_s_o_r_d_e_r and depression) than that found in the general population.

Three patterns may exist between affect and creativity at work: positive (or
negative) mood, or change in mood, predictably precedes creativity; creativity
predictably precedes mood; and whether affect and creativity occur
simultaneously.
It was found that not only might affect precede creativity, but creative
outcomes might provoke affect as well. At its simplest level, the experience of
creativity is itself a work event, and like other events in the organizational
context, it could evoke emotion. Qualitative research and anecdotal accounts of
creative achievement in the arts and sciences suggest that creative insight is
often followed by feelings of elation. For example, Albert Einstein called his
1907 general theory of relativity "the happiest thought of my life." Empirical
evidence on this matter is still very tentative.
In contrast to the possible _i_n_c_u_b_a_t_i_o_n effects of affective state on subsequent
creativity, the affective consequences of creativity are likely to be more
direct and immediate. In general, affective events provoke immediate and
relatively fleeting emotional reactions. Thus, if creative performance at work
is an affective event for the individual doing the creative work, such an
effect would likely be evident only in same-day data.
Another longitudinal research found several insights regarding the relations
between creativity and emotion at work. Firstly, evidence shows a positive
correlation between positive affect and creativity. The more positive a
person's affect on a given day, the more creative thinking they evidenced that
day and the next day‚Äîeven controlling for that next day's mood. There was
even some evidence of an effect two days later.
In addition, the researchers found no evidence that people were more creative
when they experienced both positive and negative affect on the same day. The
weight of evidence supports a purely linear form of the affect-creativity
relationship, at least over the range of affect and creativity covered in our
study: the more positive a person's affect, the higher their creativity in a
work setting.
Finally, they found four patterns of affect and creativity: affect can operate
as an antecedent to creativity; as a direct consequence of creativity; as an
indirect consequence of creativity; and affect can occur simultaneously with
creative activity. Thus, it appears that people's feelings and creative
cognitions are interwoven in several distinct ways within the complex fabric of
their daily work lives.

_J_√_º_r_g_e_n_ _S_c_h_m_i_d_h_u_b_e_r's formal _t_h_e_o_r_y of creativity_[_8_4_]_[_8_5_] postulates that
creativity, curiosity and interestingness are by-products of a simple
_c_o_m_p_u_t_a_t_i_o_n_a_l principle for measuring and optimizing learning progress.
Consider an agent able to manipulate its environment and thus its own _s_e_n_s_o_r_y
inputs. The agent can use a _b_l_a_c_k_ _b_o_x optimization method such as _r_e_i_n_f_o_r_c_e_m_e_n_t
_l_e_a_r_n_i_n_g to learn (through informed trial and error) sequences of actions that
maximize the expected sum of its future _r_e_w_a_r_d signals. There are extrinsic
reward signals for achieving externally given goals, such as finding food when
hungry. But Schmidhuber's _o_b_j_e_c_t_i_v_e_ _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n to be maximized also includes an
additional, intrinsic term to model "wow-effects." This non-standard term
motivates purely creative behavior of the agent even when there are no external
goals. A wow-effect is formally defined as follows. As the agent is creating
and predicting and encoding the continually growing history of actions and
sensory inputs, it keeps improving the predictor or encoder, which can be
implemented as an _a_r_t_i_f_i_c_i_a_l_ _n_e_u_r_a_l_ _n_e_t_w_o_r_k or some other _m_a_c_h_i_n_e_ _l_e_a_r_n_i_n_g
device that can exploit regularities in the data to improve its performance
over time. The improvements can be measured precisely, by computing the
difference in computational costs (storage size, number of required synapses,
errors, time) needed to encode new observations before and after learning. This
difference depends on the encoder's present subjective knowledge, which changes
over time, but the theory formally takes this into account. The cost difference
measures the strength of the present "wow-effect" due to sudden improvements in
_d_a_t_a_ _c_o_m_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n or computational speed. It becomes an intrinsic reward signal
for the action selector. The objective function thus motivates the action
optimizer to create action sequences causing more wow-effects. Irregular,
random data (or noise) do not permit any wow-effects or learning progress, and
thus are "boring" by nature (providing no reward). Already known and
predictable regularities also are boring. Temporarily interesting are only the
initially unknown, novel, regular patterns in both actions and observations.
This motivates the agent to perform continual, open-ended, active, creative
exploration.
According to Schmidhuber, his objective function explains the activities of
scientists, artists and _c_o_m_e_d_i_a_n_s._[_8_6_]_[_8_7_] For example, _p_h_y_s_i_c_i_s_t_s are
motivated to create experiments leading to observations obeying previously
unpublished _p_h_y_s_i_c_a_l_ _l_a_w_s permitting better _d_a_t_a_ _c_o_m_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n. Likewise,
composers receive intrinsic reward for creating non-arbitrary melodies with
unexpected but regular harmonies that permit wow-effects through data
compression improvements. Similarly, a comedian gets intrinsic reward for
"inventing a novel joke with an unexpected _p_u_n_c_h_ _l_i_n_e, related to the beginning
of the story in an initially unexpected but quickly learnable way that also
allows for better compression of the perceived data."_[_8_8_] Schmidhuber argues
that that ongoing _c_o_m_p_u_t_e_r_ _h_a_r_d_w_a_r_e advances will greatly scale up rudimentary

A study looking at 300,000 persons with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or

professions for those with bipolar disorder as well as for undiagnosed siblings
of those with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. There was no overall
overrepresenation, but overrepresentation for artistic occupations, among those
diagnosed with schizophrenia. There was no association for those with unipolar
depression or their relatives. _[_9_7_]
Another study involving more than one million people, conducted by Swedish
researchers at the Karolinska Institute, reported a number of correlations
between creative occupations and mental illnesses. Writers had a higher risk of
anxiety and bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, unipolar depression, and
substance abuse, and were almost twice as likely as the general population to
kill themselves. Dancers and photographers were also more likely to have
bipolar disorder._[_9_8_]

suffer from psychiatric disorders than other people, although they were more

Creativity can be expresses in a number of different forms, depending on the
unique people and environments it exists. A number of different theorists have
suggested models of the creative person. One model suggests that there are
kinds to produce growth, innovation, speed, etc. These are referred to as the
four "Creativity Profiles" that can help achieve such goals._[_1_0_0_]
      (i) Incubate (Long-term Development)
      (ii) Imagine (Breakthrough Ideas)
      (iii) Improve (Incremental Adjustments)
      (iv) Invest (Short-term Goals)
Research by Dr Mark Batey of the Psychometrics at Work Research Group at
_M_a_n_c_h_e_s_t_e_r_ _B_u_s_i_n_e_s_s_ _S_c_h_o_o_l has suggested that the creative profile can be
explained by four primary creativity traits with narrow facets within each
      (i) "Idea Generation" (Fluency, Originality, Incubation and Illumination)
      (ii) "Personality" (Curiosity and Tolerance for Ambiguity)
      (iii) "Motivation" (Intrinsic, Extrinsic and Achievement)
      (iv) "Confidence" (Producing, Sharing and Implementing)
This model was developed in a sample of 1000 working adults using the
statistical techniques of Exploratory Factor Analysis followed by Confirmatory
Factor Analysis by Structural Equation Modelling._[_1_0_1_]
An important aspect of the creativity profiling approach is to account for the
tension between predicting the creative profile of an individual, as
characterised by the _p_s_y_c_h_o_m_e_t_r_i_c approach, and the evidence that team
creativity is founded on diversity and difference._[_1_0_2_]
One characteristic of creative people, as measured by some psychologists, is
what is called divergent production. divergent production is the ability of a
person to generate a diverse assortment, yet an appropriate amount of responses
to a given situation._[_1_0_3_] One way of measuring divergent production is by
administering the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking._[_1_0_4_] The Torrance Tests
of Creative Thinking assesses the diversity, quantity, and appropriateness of
participants responses to a variety of open-ended questions.
Other researchers of creativity see the difference in creative people as a
cognitive process of dedication to problem solving and developing expertise in
the field of their creative expression. Hard working people study the work of
people before them and within their current area, become experts in their
fields, and then have the ability to add to and build upon previous information
in innovative and creative ways. In a study of projects by design students,
students who had more knowledge on their subject on average had greater
creativity within their projects._[_1_0_5_]
The aspect of motivation within a person's personality may predict creativity
levels in the person. Motivation stems from two different sources, intrinsic
and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation is an internal drive within a
person to participate or invest as a result of personal interest, desires,
hopes, goals, etc. Extrinsic motivation is a drive from outside of a person and
might take the form of payment, rewards, fame, approval from others, etc.
Although extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation can both increase
creativity in certain cases, strictly extrinsic motivation often impedes
creativity in people._[_1_0_6_]
From a personality-traits perspective, there are a number of traits that are
associated with creativity in people._[_1_0_7_] Creative people tend to be more open
to new experiences, are more self-confident, are more ambitious, self-
accepting, impulsive, driven, dominant, and hostile, compared to people with
less creativity.
From an evolutionary perspective, creativity may be a result of the outcome of
years of generating ideas. As ideas are continuously generated, the need to
evolve produces a need for new ideas and developments. As a result, people have
been creating and developing new, innovative, and creative ideas to build our
progress as a society._[_1_0_8_]
In studying exceptionally creative people in history, some common traits in
lifestyle and environment are often found. Creative people in history usually
had supportive parents, but rigid and non-nurturing. Most had an interest in
their field at an early age, and most had a highly supportive and skilled
mentor in their field of interest. Often the field they chose was relatively
uncharted, allowing for their creativity to be expressed more in a field with
less previous information. Most exceptionally creative people devoted almost
all of their time and energy into their craft, and after about a decade had a
creative breakthrough of fame. Their lives were marked with extreme dedication
and a cycle of hard-work and breakthroughs as a result of their determination
_[_1_0_9_]
Another theory of creative people is the investment theory of creativity. This
approach suggest that there are many individual and environmental factors that
must exist in precise ways for extremelly high levels of creativity opposed to
average levels of creativity. In the investment sense, a person with their
particular characteristics in their particular environment may see an
opportunity to devote their time and energy into something that has been
overlooked by others. The creative person develops an undervalued or
underrecognized idea to the point that it is established as a new and creative
idea. Just like in the financial world, some investments are worth the buy in,
while others are less productive and do not build to the extent that the
investor expected. This investment theory of creativity views creativity in a
unique perspective compared to others, by asserting that creativity might rely

Creativity is viewed differently in different countries._[_1_1_1_] For example,
cross-cultural research centred on _H_o_n_g_ _K_o_n_g found that Westerners view
creativity more in terms of the individual attributes of a creative person,
such as their aesthetic taste, while Chinese people view creativity more in
terms of the social influence of creative people e.g. what they can contribute
to society._[_1_1_2_] Mpofu et al. surveyed 28 African languages and found that 27
had no word which directly translated to 'creativity' (the exception being
_A_r_a_b_i_c)._[_1_1_3_] The principle of _l_i_n_g_u_i_s_t_i_c_ _r_e_l_a_t_i_v_i_t_y, i.e. that language can
affect thought, suggests that the lack of an equivalent word for 'creativity'
may affect the views of creativity among speakers of such languages. However,
more research would be needed to establish this, and there is certainly no
suggestion that this linguistic difference makes people any less (or more)
creative; _A_f_r_i_c_a has a rich heritage of creative pursuits such as _m_u_s_i_c, _a_r_t,
and _s_t_o_r_y_t_e_l_l_i_n_g. Nevertheless, it is true that there has been very little
research on creativity in Africa,_[_1_1_4_] and there has also been very little
research on creativity in Latin America._[_1_1_5_] Creativity has been more
thoroughly researched in the northern hemisphere, but here again there are
cultural differences, even between countries or groups of countries in close
proximity. For example, in Scandinavian countries, creativity is seen as an
individual attitude which helps in coping with life's challenges,_[_1_1_6_] while in
Germany, creativity is seen more as a process that can be applied to help solve
problems._[_1_1_7_]

Most people associate creativity with the fields of _a_r_t and _l_i_t_e_r_a_t_u_r_e. In
these fields, originality is considered to be a sufficient condition for
creativity, unlike other fields where both originality and appropriateness are
necessary._[_1_1_8_]
Within the different modes of artistic expression, one can postulate a
continuum extending from "_i_n_t_e_r_p_r_e_t_a_t_i_o_n" to "innovation". Established _a_r_t_i_s_t_i_c
_m_o_v_e_m_e_n_t_s and _g_e_n_r_e_s pull practitioners to the "interpretation" end of the
scale, whereas original thinkers strive towards the "innovation" pole. Note
that we conventionally expect some "creative" people (dancers, actors,
orchestral members, etc.) to perform (interpret) while allowing others
(writers, painters, composers, etc.) more freedom to express the new and the
different.

      divine sources such as the _M_u_s_e_s; a taste of the Divine._[_1_1_9_] Compare
      with _i_n_v_e_n_t_i_o_n.
    * artistic _e_v_o_l_u_t_i_o_n, which stresses obeying established ("classical")
      rules and imitating or _a_p_p_r_o_p_r_i_a_t_i_n_g to produce subtly different but
      unshockingly understandable work. Compare with _c_r_a_f_t_s.
    * artistic conversation, as in _S_u_r_r_e_a_l_i_s_m, which stresses the depth of
      communication when the creative product is the language.
In the _a_r_t practice and _t_h_e_o_r_y of _D_a_v_o_r_ _D_z_a_l_t_o, human creativity is taken as a
basic feature of both the personal _e_x_i_s_t_e_n_c_e of _h_u_m_a_n_ _b_e_i_n_g and _a_r_t production.
For this thinker, creativity is a basic cultural and anthropological category,
since it enables human manifestation in the world as a "real presence" in
contrast to the progressive "virtualization" of the world.

contrast to authors who identify _l_a_n_g_u_a_g_e and _c_o_g_n_i_t_i_o_n, he describes his own
mathematical thinking as largely wordless, often accompanied by _m_e_n_t_a_l_ _i_m_a_g_e_s

the responses mirrored his own.

Creative professions include writing, art, design, theater, television, radio,
motion pictures, related crafts, as well as marketing, strategy, some aspects
of scientific research and development, product development, some types of
teaching and curriculum design, and more. Since many creative professionals
(actors and writers, for example) are also employed in secondary professions,
estimates of creative professionals are often inaccurate. By some estimates,
approximately 10 million US workers are creative professionals; depending upon
the depth and breadth of the definition, this estimate may be double.

_r_e_s_e_a_r_c_h. These fields explicitly value creativity, and journals such as Design

Fields such as _s_c_i_e_n_c_e and _e_n_g_i_n_e_e_r_i_n_g have, by contrast, experienced a less
explicit (but arguably no less important) relation to creativity. Simonton_[_2_5_]
shows how some of the major scientific advances of the 20th century can be

increasingly important for engineers in years to come._[_1_3_1_]

_c_r_e_a_t_i_v_e_ _a_c_c_o_u_n_t_i_n_g. Although this term often implies unethical practices,

In a recent global survey of approximately 1600 CEO's, the leadership trait
that was considered to be most crucial for success was creativity._[_1_3_2_] This

It has been the topic of various research studies to establish that
organizational effectiveness depends on the creativity of the workforce to a
large extent. For any given organization, measures of effectiveness vary,
depending upon its mission, environmental context, nature of work, the product
or service it produces, and customer demands. Thus, the first step in
evaluating organizational effectiveness is to understand the organization
itself - how it functions, how it is structured, and what it emphasizes.
