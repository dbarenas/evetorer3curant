An eeccoonnoommyy is the total sum of product and service transactions of value
between two agents in a region, be it individuals, organizations or states. An
economy consists of the _e_c_o_n_o_m_i_c_ _s_y_s_t_e_m, comprising the _p_r_o_d_u_c_t_i_o_n,
_d_i_s_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_o_n or _t_r_a_d_e, and _c_o_n_s_u_m_p_t_i_o_n of limited _g_o_o_d_s and _s_e_r_v_i_c_e_s between
two agents, the agents can be individuals, businesses, organizations, or
governments. Transactions only occur when both parties agree to the value or
price of the transacted good, commonly expressed in a certain _c_u_r_r_e_n_c_y.
In the past, economic activity was theorized to be bounded by natural
resources, labor, and capital. This view ignores the value of technology
(automation, accelerator of process, reduction of cost functions), and
creativity (new products, services, processes, new markets, expands markets,
diversification of markets, niche markets, increases revenue functions),
especially that which produces intellectual property.
A given economy is the result of a set of processes that involves its culture,
values, education, technological evolution, history, social organization,
political structure and legal systems, as well as its geography, natural
resource endowment, and ecology, as main factors. These factors give context,
content, and set the conditions and parameters in which an economy functions.
Some cultures create more productive economies and function better than others,
creating higher value, or GDP.
A market-based economy is where _g_o_o_d_s and _s_e_r_v_i_c_e_s are produced without
obstruction or interference, and exchanged according to _d_e_m_a_n_d and _s_u_p_p_l_y
between participants (economic agents) by _b_a_r_t_e_r or a _m_e_d_i_u_m_ _o_f_ _e_x_c_h_a_n_g_e with a
_c_r_e_d_i_t or _d_e_b_i_t _v_a_l_u_e accepted within the network, such as a unit of currency
and at some free market or market clearing price. Capital and labor can move
freely to any area of emerging shortage, signaled by rising price, and thus
dynamically and automatically relieve any such threat. Market based economies
require transparency on information, such as true prices, to work, and may
include various kinds of immaterial production, such as _a_f_f_e_c_t_i_v_e_ _l_a_b_o_r that
describes work carried out that is intended to produce or modify emotional
experiences in people, but does not have a tangible, physical product as a
result.
A command-based economy is where a central political agent commands what is
produced and how it is sold and distributed. Shortages are common problems with
a command-based economy, as there is no mechanism to manage the information
(prices) about the systems natural supply and demand dynamics.

Due to the growing importance of the financial sector in modern times,_[_1_] the
term rreeaall eeccoonnoommyy is used by analysts_[_2_]_[_3_] as well as politicians_[_4_] to denote
the part of the economy that is concerned with actually producing goods and
services,_[_5_] as ostensibly contrasted with the paper economy, or the financial
side of the economy,_[_6_] which is concerned with buying and selling on the
financial markets. Alternate and long-standing terminology distinguishes
measures of an economy expressed in _r_e_a_l values (adjusted for _i_n_f_l_a_t_i_o_n), such
as _r_e_a_l_ _G_D_P, or in _n_o_m_i_n_a_l values (unadjusted for inflation)._[_7_]

The _E_n_g_l_i_s_h words "economy" and "_e_c_o_n_o_m_i_c_s" can be traced back to the _G_r_e_e_k
words Œø·º∞Œ∫ŒøŒΩœåŒºŒøœÇ (i.e. "one who manages a household"), a composite
word derived from Œø·º∂Œ∫ŒøœÇ ("house") and ŒΩŒ≠Œºœâ ("manage; distribute") by
way of Œø·º∞Œ∫ŒøŒΩŒøŒºŒØŒ± ("household management").
The first recorded sense of the word "economy" is in the phrase "the management
of ≈ìconomic affairs", found in a work possibly composed in a monastery in
1440. "Economy" is later recorded in more general senses, including "thrift"
and "administration".
The most frequently used current sense, denoting "the economic system of a
country or an area", seems not to have developed until the 19th or 20th
century._[_8_]

As long as someone has been making, supplying and distributing goods or
services, there has been some sort of economy; economies grew larger as
societies grew and became more complex. _S_u_m_e_r developed a large-scale economy
based on _c_o_m_m_o_d_i_t_y_ _m_o_n_e_y, while the _B_a_b_y_l_o_n_i_a_n_s and their neighboring _c_i_t_y
_s_t_a_t_e_s later developed the earliest system of _e_c_o_n_o_m_i_c_s as we think of, in
terms of rules/laws on _d_e_b_t, legal contracts and law codes relating to business
practices, and private property._[_9_]
The Babylonians and their city state neighbors developed forms of economics
comparable to currently used civil society (law) concepts._[_1_0_] They developed
the first known codified legal and administrative systems, complete with
courts, jails, and government records.
The ancient economy was mainly based on _s_u_b_s_i_s_t_e_n_c_e_ _f_a_r_m_i_n_g. The _S_h_e_k_e_l
referred to an ancient unit of weight and currency. The first usage of the term
came from _M_e_s_o_p_o_t_a_m_i_a circa 3000 BC. and referred to a specific mass of _b_a_r_l_e_y
which related other values in a _m_e_t_r_i_c such as silver, bronze, copper etc. A
barley/shekel was originally both a unit of _c_u_r_r_e_n_c_y and a unit of weight...
just as the British Pound was originally a unit denominating a one pound mass
of silver.
For most people the exchange of goods occurred through social relationships.
There were also traders who bartered in the marketplaces. In _A_n_c_i_e_n_t_ _G_r_e_e_c_e,
where the present English word 'economy' originated, many people were _b_o_n_d
_s_l_a_v_e_s of the _f_r_e_e_h_o_l_d_e_r_s. Economic discussion was driven by _s_c_a_r_c_i_t_y.

In _M_e_d_i_e_v_a_l times, what we now call economy was not far from the subsistence
level. Most exchange occurred within _s_o_c_i_a_l_ _g_r_o_u_p_s. On top of this, the great
conquerors raised _v_e_n_t_u_r_e_ _c_a_p_i_t_a_l (from ventura, ital.; risk) to finance their

The European captures became branches of the _E_u_r_o_p_e_a_n states, the so-called
_c_o_l_o_n_i_e_s. The rising _n_a_t_i_o_n_-_s_t_a_t_e_s _S_p_a_i_n, _P_o_r_t_u_g_a_l, _F_r_a_n_c_e, _G_r_e_a_t_ _B_r_i_t_a_i_n and

order to protect their national economy. The so-called _m_e_r_c_a_n_t_i_l_i_s_m (from
mercator, lat.: _m_e_r_c_h_a_n_t) was a first approach to intermediate between private
wealth and _p_u_b_l_i_c_ _i_n_t_e_r_e_s_t. The _s_e_c_u_l_a_r_i_z_a_t_i_o_n in Europe allowed states to use
the immense property of the church for the development of towns. The influence

transferred the idea of supply and demand to the problem of _o_v_e_r_p_o_p_u_l_a_t_i_o_n. The

profound effect on the socioeconomic and cultural conditions starting in the
_U_n_i_t_e_d_ _K_i_n_g_d_o_m, then subsequently spreading throughout _E_u_r_o_p_e, _N_o_r_t_h_ _A_m_e_r_i_c_a,
and eventually the _w_o_r_l_d. The onset of the Industrial Revolution marked a major
turning point in human history; almost every aspect of daily life was
eventually influenced in some way. In Europe wild _c_a_p_i_t_a_l_i_s_m started to replace
the system of _m_e_r_c_a_n_t_i_l_i_s_m (today: _p_r_o_t_e_c_t_i_o_n_i_s_m) and led to _e_c_o_n_o_m_i_c_ _g_r_o_w_t_h.

policymakers searched for new ways of controlling the course of the economy.

supposed to be the fathers of the so-called _n_e_o_l_i_b_e_r_a_l_i_s_m. However, the
prevailing view was that held by _J_o_h_n_ _M_a_y_n_a_r_d_ _K_e_y_n_e_s (1883‚Äì1946), who argued
for a stronger control of the _m_a_r_k_e_t_s by the state. The theory that the state
can alleviate economic problems and instigate economic growth through state
manipulation of aggregate demand is called _K_e_y_n_e_s_i_a_n_i_s_m in his honor. In the
late 1950s the economic growth in America and Europe‚Äîoften called

together the significance that the _s_e_r_v_i_c_e_ _s_e_c_t_o_r receives at the place of the
industrialization, as well as the growing need and valuation of knowledge and
creativity for the businesses. In fact the idea of the post-industrial society
has its beginning in the 70s _[_1_1_] but the term came to common usage to describe
the growth of economies like the Chinese at the period (the term is
specifically used by _B_i_l_l_ _C_l_i_n_t_o_n in a speech about Republic of China in 1998).
With the spread of _I_n_t_e_r_n_e_t as a mass media and communication medium especially
after 2000-2001 the idea for the Internet and information economy is given
place because of the growing importance of ecommerce and electronic businesses,
also the term for a global information society as understanding of a new type
of "all-connected" society is created. In the late 00s the new type of
economies and economic expansions of countries like China, Brazil and India
bring attention and interest to different from the usually dominating Western
type economies and economic models.

The economy may be considered as having developed through the following Phases
or Degrees of Precedence.
    * The _a_n_c_i_e_n_t_ _e_c_o_n_o_m_y was mainly based on _s_u_b_s_i_s_t_e_n_c_e farming.
    * The _i_n_d_u_s_t_r_i_a_l_ _r_e_v_o_l_u_t_i_o_n phase lessened the role of _s_u_b_s_i_s_t_e_n_c_e farming,
      converting it to more _e_x_t_e_n_s_i_v_e and _m_o_n_o_-_c_u_l_t_u_r_a_l forms of agriculture in
      the last three centuries. The economic growth took place mostly in
      mining, construction and manufacturing industries. _C_o_m_m_e_r_c_e became more
      significant due to the need for improved exchange and distribution of
      produce throughout the community.
    * In the economies of modern _c_o_n_s_u_m_e_r_ _s_o_c_i_e_t_i_e_s phase there is a growing
      part played by _s_e_r_v_i_c_e_s, _f_i_n_a_n_c_e, and _t_e_c_h_n_o_l_o_g_y‚Äîthe (_k_n_o_w_l_e_d_g_e
      _e_c_o_n_o_m_y).
In modern economies, these phase precedences are somewhat differently expressed
by degrees of activity.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]

The _G_D_P - Gross domestic product of a country is a measure of the size of its
economy. The most conventional economic analysis of a country relies heavily on
economic indicators like the GDP and _G_D_P_ _p_e_r_ _c_a_p_i_t_a. While often useful, it
should be noted that GDP only includes economic activity for which money is
exchanged.

An informal economy is economic activity that is neither taxed nor monitored by
a government, contrasted with a formal economy. The informal economy is thus
not included in that government's _G_r_o_s_s_ _N_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _P_r_o_d_u_c_t (GNP). Although the
informal economy is often associated with _d_e_v_e_l_o_p_i_n_g_ _c_o_u_n_t_r_i_e_s, all economic
systems contain an informal economy in some proportion.
Informal economic activity is a dynamic process which includes many aspects of
economic and social theory including exchange, regulation, and enforcement. By
its nature, it is necessarily difficult to observe, study, define, and measure.
No single source readily or authoritatively defines informal economy as a unit
of study.
The terms "under the table" and "off the books" typically refer to this type of
economy. The term _b_l_a_c_k_ _m_a_r_k_e_t refers to a specific subset of the informal
economy. The term "informal sector" was used in many earlier studies, and has
been mostly replaced in more recent studies which use the newer term.
