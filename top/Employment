An employee contributes labor and/or expertise to an endeavor of an employer
and is usually hired to perform specific duties which are packaged into a _j_o_b.
An Employee is a person who is hired to provide services to a company on a
regular basis in exchange for compensation and who does not provide these
services as part of an independent business.

Employer and managerial control within an organization rests at many levels and
has important implications for staff and productivity alike, with control
forming the fundamental link between desired outcomes and actual processes.
Employers must balance interests such as decreasing wage constraints with a
maximization of labor productivity in order to achieve a profitable and
productive employment relationship.

However, a study has shown that such consultants may not be reliable when they
fail to use established principles in selecting employees._[_1_] A more
traditional approach is with a "Help Wanted" _s_i_g_n in the establishment (usually

This is referred to as _a_t_-_w_i_l_l_ _e_m_p_l_o_y_m_e_n_t. The contract between the two parties

Wage labor is the _s_o_c_i_o_e_c_o_n_o_m_i_c relationship between a _w_o_r_k_e_r and an employer,
where the worker sells their _l_a_b_o_r under a formal or informal employment
_c_o_n_t_r_a_c_t. These transactions usually occur in a _l_a_b_o_r_ _m_a_r_k_e_t where _w_a_g_e_s are
market determined._[_4_]_[_5_] In exchange for the wages paid, the work product
generally becomes the _u_n_d_i_f_f_e_r_e_n_t_i_a_t_e_d_ _p_r_o_p_e_r_t_y of the employer, except for
special cases such as the vesting of _i_n_t_e_l_l_e_c_t_u_a_l_ _p_r_o_p_e_r_t_y patents in the

inventor. A wage laborer is a person whose primary means of income is from the
selling of his or her labor in this way.
In modern mixed economies such as that of the _O_E_C_D countries, it is currently
the dominant form of work arrangement. Although most work occurs following this
structure, the wage work arrangements of _C_E_O_s, professional employees, and
professional contract workers are sometimes conflated with _c_l_a_s_s_ _a_s_s_i_g_n_m_e_n_t_s,
so that "wage labor" is considered to apply only to unskilled, semi-skilled or

instance in California unjust termination reasons include marital status,
ancestry, sexual orientation or medical condition. Despite whatever agreement
an employer makes with an employee for the employee's wages, an employee is
entitled to certain minimum wages set by the _f_e_d_e_r_a_l_ _g_o_v_e_r_n_m_e_n_t. The states may

According to Swedish law,_[_1_1_] there are three types of employment.
    * Test employment (swe: Provanst√§llning), where the employer hires a
      person for a test period of max 6 months. The employment can be ended at
      any time without giving any reason. This type of employment can be
      offered only once per employer and employee. Usually a time limited or
      normal employment is offered after a test employment.
    * Time limited employment (swe: Tidsbegr√§nsad anst√§llning). The employer
      hires a person for a specified time. Usually they are extended for a new
      period. Total maximum two years per employee per employer and employee,
      then it automatically counts as a normal employment.
    * Normal employment (swe: Tillsvidareanst√§llning / Fast anst√§llning),
      which has no time limit (except for retirement etc.). It can still be
      ended for two reasons: personal reason, only strong reasons such as
      crime. Or: lack of work tasks (swe: Arbetsbrist), cancellation of
      employment, usually because of bad income for the company. There is a
      cancellation period of 1‚Äì6 months, and rules for how to select
      employees, basically those with shortest employment time shall be
      cancelled first.
There are no laws about _m_i_n_i_m_u_m_ _s_a_l_a_r_y in Sweden. Instead there are agreements
between employer organizations and trade unions about minimum salaries, and
other employment conditions.

_O_r_g_a_n_i_s_a_t_i_o_n (ILO) estimates that as many as 40% of workers as poor, not
earning enough to keep their families above the $2 a day _p_o_v_e_r_t_y_ _l_i_n_e._[_1_2_] For
instance, in _I_n_d_i_a most of the chronically poor are wage earners in formal
employment, because their jobs are insecure and low paid and offer no chance to
accumulate wealth to avoid risks._[_1_2_] This problems appears to be caused by the
decreasing likelihood of a simultaneous growth in employment opportunities and
in _l_a_b_o_r_ _p_r_o_d_u_c_t_i_v_i_t_y._[_1_2_] According to the _U_N_R_I_S_D, increasing labor
productivity appears to have a negative impact on job creation: in the 1960s, a
1% increase in output per worker was associated with a reduction in employment
growth of 0.07%, by the first decade of this century the same productivity
increase implies reduced employment growth by 0.54%._[_1_2_] Both increased
employment opportunities and increased labor productivity (as long as it also
translates into higher wages) are needed to tackle poverty. Increases in
employment without increases in productivity leads to a rise in the number of
"working poor", which is why some experts are now promoting the creation of
"quality" and not "quantity" in labor market policies._[_1_2_] This approach does
highlight how higher productivity has helped reduce poverty in _E_a_s_t_ _A_s_i_a, but
the negative impact is beginning to show._[_1_2_] In _V_i_e_t_n_a_m, for example,
employment growth has slowed while productivity growth has continued._[_1_2_]
Furthermore, productivity increases do not always lead to increased wages, as
can be seen in the _U_n_i_t_e_d_ _S_t_a_t_e_s, where the gap between productivity and wages
has been rising since the 1980s._[_1_2_]

Scholars conceptualize the employment relationship in various ways._[_1_3_] A key
assumption is the extent to which the employment relationship necessarily
includes conflicts of interests between employers and employees, and the form
of such conflicts._[_1_4_] In economic theorizing, the labor market mediates all
such conflicts such that employers and employees who enter into an employment
relationship are assumed to find this arrangement in their own self-interest.
In human resource management theorizing, employers and employees are assumed to
have shared interests (or a unity of interests, hence the label
‚Äúunitarism‚Äù). Any conflicts that exist are seen as a manifestation of poor
human resource management policies or interpersonal clashes such as personality
conflicts, both of which can and should be managed away. From the perspective
of pluralist industrial relations, the employment relationship is characterized
by a plurality of stakeholders with legitimate interests (hence the label
‚Äúpluralism), and some conflicts of interests are seen as inherent in the
employment relationship (e.g., wages v. profits). Lastly, the critical paradigm
emphasizes antagonistic conflicts of interests between various groups (e.g.,
the competing capitalist and _w_o_r_k_i_n_g_ _c_l_a_s_s_e_s in a Marxist framework) that are
part of a deeper social conflict of unequal power relations. As a result, there
are four common models of employment:_[_1_5_]
   1. Mainstream economics: employment is seen as a mutually advantageous
      transaction in a free market between self-interested legal and economic
      equals
   2. _H_u_m_a_n_ _r_e_s_o_u_r_c_e_ _m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t (unitarism): employment is a long-term
      partnership of employees and employers with common interests
   3. _P_l_u_r_a_l_i_s_t_ _i_n_d_u_s_t_r_i_a_l_ _r_e_l_a_t_i_o_n_s: employment is a bargained exchange
      between stakeholders with some common and some competing economic
      interests and unequal bargaining power due to imperfect labor markets
   4. Critical _i_n_d_u_s_t_r_i_a_l_ _r_e_l_a_t_i_o_n_s: employment is an unequal power relation
      between competing groups that is embedded in and inseparable from
      systemic inequalities throughout the socio-politico-economic system.
These models are important because they help reveal why individuals hold
differing perspectives on human resource management policies, labor unions, and
employment regulation._[_1_6_] For example, human resource management policies are
seen as dictated by the market in the first view, as essential mechanisms for
aligning the interests of employees and employers and thereby creating
profitable companies in the second view, as insufficient for looking out for
workers‚Äô interests in the third view, and as manipulative managerial tools
for shaping the ideology and structure of the workplace in the fourth view._[_1_7_]

The balance of economic efficiency and social equity is the ultimate debate in
the field of _e_m_p_l_o_y_m_e_n_t_ _r_e_l_a_t_i_o_n_s._[_1_8_] By meeting the needs of the employer;
generating profits to establish and maintain economic efficiency; whilst
maintaining a balance with the employee and creating social equity that
benefits the worker so that he/she can fund and enjoy healthy living; proves to
be a continuous revolving issue in westernized societies.
_G_l_o_b_a_l_i_z_a_t_i_o_n has effected these issues by creating certain economic factors
that disallow or allow various employment issues. Economist Edward Lee (1996)
studies the effects of globalization and summarizes the four major points of
concern that affect employment relations:
   1. International competition, from the _n_e_w_l_y_ _i_n_d_u_s_t_r_i_a_l_i_z_e_d_ _c_o_u_n_t_r_i_e_s, will
      cause unemployment growth and increased wage disparity for unskilled
      workers in industrialized countries. Imports from low-wage countries
      exert pressure on the manufacturing sector in industrialized countries
      and foreign direct investment (FDI) is attracted away from the
      industrialized nations, towards low-waged countries.
   2. Economic liberalization will result in unemployment and wage inequality
      in developing countries. This happens as job losses in uncompetitive
      industries outstrip job opportunities in new industries.
   3. Workers will be forced to accept worsening wages and conditions, as a
      global labor market results in a ‚Äúrace to the bottom‚Äù. Increased
      international competition creates a pressure to reduce the wages and
      conditions of workers.
   4. Globalization reduces the autonomy of the nation state. Capital is
      increasingly mobile and the ability of the state to regulate economic
      activity is reduced.
What also results from Lee‚Äôs (1996) findings is that in industrialized
countries an average of almost 70 per cent of workers are employed in the
service sector, most of which consists of non-tradable activities. As a result,
workers are forced to become more skilled and develop sought after trades, or
find other means of survival. Ultimately this is a result of changes and trends
of employment, an evolving workforce, and globalization that is represented by
a more skilled and increasing highly diverse labor force, that are growing in
non standard forms of employment (Markey, R. et al. 2006).
