In _p_o_l_i_t_i_c_a_l_ _e_c_o_n_o_m_i_c_s, eennttrreepprreenneeuurrsshhiipp is the quality of being an
_e_n_t_r_e_p_r_e_n_e_u_r, i.e. one who "undertakes an enterprise"._[_1_] The term puts
emphasis on the risk and effort taken by individuals who both own and manage a
business, and on the _i_n_n_o_v_a_t_i_o_n_s resulting from their pursuit of economic
success.
"Entrepreneurship" in this sense may result in new _o_r_g_a_n_i_z_a_t_i_o_n_s or may be part
of revitalizing mature _o_r_g_a_n_i_z_a_t_i_o_n_s in response to a perceived opportunity.
The most obvious form of entrepreneurship is that of starting new _b_u_s_i_n_e_s_s_e_s
(referred as _s_t_a_r_t_u_p_ _c_o_m_p_a_n_y); in recent years, the term has been extended to
include social and political forms of entrepreneurial activity".[_a_c_c_o_r_d_i_n_g_ _t_o
_w_h_o_m_?] When entrepreneurship is describing activities within a firm or large
organization it is referred to as _i_n_t_r_a_-_p_r_e_n_e_u_r_s_h_i_p and may include corporate
venturing, when large entities spin-off organizations._[_2_]
According to Paul Reynolds, an "entrepreneurship scholar"[_c_l_a_r_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]
and creator of the _G_l_o_b_a_l_ _E_n_t_r_e_p_r_e_n_e_u_r_s_h_i_p_ _M_o_n_i_t_o_r, "by the time they reach
their retirement years, half of all working men in the United States probably
have a period of self-employment of one or more years; one in four may have
engaged in self-employment for six or more years. Participating in a new
business creation is a common activity among U.S. workers over the course of
their careers."_[_3_] And in recent years has been documented by scholars such as
_D_a_v_i_d_ _A_u_d_r_e_t_s_c_h to be a major driver of _e_c_o_n_o_m_i_c_ _g_r_o_w_t_h in both the United
States and Western Europe. "As well, entrepreneurship may be defined as the
pursuit of opportunity without regard to resources currently controlled
(Stevenson,1983)"_[_4_]
Entrepreneurial activities are substantially different depending on the type of
organization and creativity involved. Entrepreneurship ranges in scale from
solo projects (even involving the entrepreneur only part-time) to major
undertakings creating many job opportunities. Many "high value" entrepreneurial
ventures seek _v_e_n_t_u_r_e_ _c_a_p_i_t_a_l or _a_n_g_e_l_ _f_u_n_d_i_n_g (_s_e_e_d_ _m_o_n_e_y) in order to raise
_c_a_p_i_t_a_l to build the business. Angel investors generally seek annualized
returns of 20‚Äì30% and more, as well as extensive involvement in the business.
_[_5_] Many kinds of organizations now exist to support would-be entrepreneurs
including specialized government agencies, _b_u_s_i_n_e_s_s_ _i_n_c_u_b_a_t_o_r_s, _s_c_i_e_n_c_e_ _p_a_r_k_s,
and some _N_G_O_s. In more recent times, the term entrepreneurship has been
extended to include elements not related necessarily to business formation
activity such as conceptualizations of entrepreneurship as a specific _m_i_n_d_s_e_t
(see also _e_n_t_r_e_p_r_e_n_e_u_r_i_a_l_ _m_i_n_d_s_e_t) resulting in entrepreneurial initiatives
e.g. in the form of _s_o_c_i_a_l_ _e_n_t_r_e_p_r_e_n_e_u_r_s_h_i_p, _p_o_l_i_t_i_c_a_l_ _e_n_t_r_e_p_r_e_n_e_u_r_s_h_i_p, or

Since 2008, an annual "_G_l_o_b_a_l_ _E_n_t_r_e_p_r_e_n_e_u_r_s_h_i_p_ _W_e_e_k" has been announced, with
the aim of "exposing people to the benefits of entrepreneurship" and getting
them to "participate in entrepreneurial-related activities".

The _e_n_t_r_e_p_r_e_n_e_u_r is a factor in _m_i_c_r_o_e_c_o_n_o_m_i_c_s, and the study of
entrepreneurship reaches back to the work of _R_i_c_h_a_r_d_ _C_a_n_t_i_l_l_o_n and _A_d_a_m_ _S_m_i_t_h
in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, foundational to _c_l_a_s_s_i_c_a_l_ _e_c_o_n_o_m_i_c_s.
In the 20th century, entrepreneurship was studied _J_o_s_e_p_h_ _S_c_h_u_m_p_e_t_e_r in the
1930s and other _A_u_s_t_r_i_a_n_ _e_c_o_n_o_m_i_s_t_s such as _C_a_r_l_ _M_e_n_g_e_r, _L_u_d_w_i_g_ _v_o_n_ _M_i_s_e_s and
_F_r_i_e_d_r_i_c_h_ _v_o_n_ _H_a_y_e_k. The term "entrepreneurship" was coined around the 1920s
(while the loan of French _e_n_t_r_e_p_r_e_n_e_u_r itself dates to the 1850s). It became
something as a buzzword from about 2010, in the context of the disputes which
have erupted surrounding the consensus of _m_a_i_n_s_t_r_e_a_m_ _e_c_o_n_o_m_i_c_s in the wake of

In Schumpeter (2012), an entrepreneur is a person who is willing and able to
convert a new idea or _i_n_v_e_n_t_i_o_n into a successful innovation._[_6_]
Entrepreneurship employs what Schumpeter called "the gale of _c_r_e_a_t_i_v_e
_d_e_s_t_r_u_c_t_i_o_n" to replace in whole or in part inferior innovations across markets
and industries, simultaneously creating new products including new _b_u_s_i_n_e_s_s
_m_o_d_e_l_s. In this way, creative destruction is largely responsible for the
dynamism of industries and long-run _e_c_o_n_o_m_i_c_ _g_r_o_w_t_h. The supposition that
entrepreneurship leads to economic growth is an interpretation of the residual
in _e_n_d_o_g_e_n_o_u_s_ _g_r_o_w_t_h_ _t_h_e_o_r_y and as such is hotly debated in academic economics.
An alternate description posited by _I_s_r_a_e_l_ _K_i_r_z_n_e_r suggests that the majority
of innovations may be much more incremental improvements such as the
replacement of paper with plastic in the construction of a drinking straw.
For Schumpeter, entrepreneurship resulted in new industries but also in new
combinations of currently existing inputs. Schumpeter's initial example of this
was the combination of a steam engine and then current wagon making
technologies to produce the horseless carriage. In this case the innovation,
the car, was transformational but did not require the development of a new
technology, merely the application of existing technologies in a novel manner.
It did not immediately replace the horsedrawn carriage, but in time,
incremental improvements which reduced the cost and improved the technology led
to the complete practical replacement of beast drawn vehicles in modern
transportation. Despite Schumpeter's early 20th-century contributions,
traditional _m_i_c_r_o_e_c_o_n_o_m_i_c theory did not formally consider the entrepreneur in
its theoretical frameworks (instead assuming that resources would find each
other through a price system). In this treatment the entrepreneur was an
implied but unspecified actor, but it is consistent with the concept of the
entrepreneur being the agent of _x_-_e_f_f_i_c_i_e_n_c_y.
Different scholars have described entrepreneurs as, among other things, bearing
risk. For Schumpeter, the entrepreneur did not bear risk: the capitalist did.

For _F_r_a_n_k_ _H_._ _K_n_i_g_h_t_[_7_] (1921) and _P_e_t_e_r_ _D_r_u_c_k_e_r (1970) entrepreneurship is
about taking _r_i_s_k. The behavior of the entrepreneur reflects a kind of person
willing to put his or her career and financial security on the line and take
risks in the name of an idea, spending much time as well as _c_a_p_i_t_a_l on an
uncertain venture.
Knight classified three types of uncertainty.
    * Risk, which is measurable statistically (such as the probability of
      drawing a red color ball from a jar containing 5 red balls and 5 white
      balls).
    * Ambiguity, which is hard to measure statistically (such as the
      probability of drawing a red ball from a jar containing 5 red balls but
      with an unknown number of white balls).
    * True Uncertainty or Knightian Uncertainty, which is impossible to
      estimate or predict statistically (such as the probability of drawing a
      red ball from a jar whose number of red balls is unknown as well as the
      number of other colored balls).
The acts of entrepreneurship are often associated with true uncertainty,
particularly when it involves bringing something really novel to the world,
whose market never exists. However, even if a market already exists, there is
no guarantee that a market exists for a particular new player in the cola
category.
The place of the disharmony-creating and idiosyncratic entrepreneur in
traditional economic _t_h_e_o_r_y (which describes many efficiency-based ratios
assuming uniform outputs) presents theoretic quandaries. _W_i_l_l_i_a_m_ _B_a_u_m_o_l has
added greatly to this area of economic theory and was recently honored for it
at the 2006 annual meeting of the _A_m_e_r_i_c_a_n_ _E_c_o_n_o_m_i_c_ _A_s_s_o_c_i_a_t_i_o_n._[_8_]

Financial _b_o_o_t_s_t_r_a_p_p_i_n_g is a term used to cover different methods for avoiding
using the financial resources of external _i_n_v_e_s_t_o_r_s. Bootstrapping can be
defined as ‚Äúa collection of methods used to minimize the amount of outside
debt and equity financing needed from banks and investors‚Äù._[_9_] The use of
private _c_r_e_d_i_t_ _c_a_r_d debt is the most known form of bootstrapping, but a wide
variety of methods are available for _e_n_t_r_e_p_r_e_n_e_u_r_s. While bootstrapping
involves a risk for the founders, the absence of any other _s_t_a_k_e_h_o_l_d_e_r gives
the founders more freedom to develop the company. Many successful companies
including _D_e_l_l Computers and _F_a_c_e_b_o_o_k were founded this way.
There are different types of bootstrapping:
