HHeeaalltthh is the level of functional or metabolic efficiency of a living organism.
In _h_u_m_a_n_s, it is the general condition of a _p_e_r_s_o_n's mind and body, usually
meaning to be free from _i_l_l_n_e_s_s, _i_n_j_u_r_y or _p_a_i_n (as in "good health" or
"healthy")._[_1_] The _W_o_r_l_d_ _H_e_a_l_t_h_ _O_r_g_a_n_i_z_a_t_i_o_n (WHO) defined health in its
broader sense in 1946 as "a state of complete physical, mental, and social
_w_e_l_l_-_b_e_i_n_g and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity."_[_2_]_[_3_] Although
this definition has been subject to controversy, in particular as lacking
operational value and because of the problem created by use of the word
"complete," it remains the most enduring._[_4_]_[_5_] Other definitions have been
proposed, among which a recent definition that correlates health and personal

_o_f_ _D_i_s_e_a_s_e_s (ICD), are commonly used to define and measure the components of
health.
Systematic activities to prevent or cure health problems and promote good
health in humans are undertaken by _h_e_a_l_t_h_ _c_a_r_e_ _p_r_o_v_i_d_e_r_s. Applications with

"healthy" is also widely used in the context of many types of non-living
organizations and their impacts for the benefit of humans, such as in the sense
of _h_e_a_l_t_h_y_ _c_o_m_m_u_n_i_t_i_e_s, _h_e_a_l_t_h_y_ _c_i_t_i_e_s or _h_e_a_l_t_h_y_ _e_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t_s. In addition to
health care interventions and a person's surroundings, a number of other
factors are known to influence the health status of individuals, including
their background, lifestyle, and economic and social conditions; these are
referred to as "determinants of health."

Generally, the context in which an individual lives is of great importance for
his health status and quality of life. It is increasingly recognized that
health is maintained and improved not only through the advancement and
application of _h_e_a_l_t_h_ _s_c_i_e_n_c_e, but also through the efforts and intelligent
_l_i_f_e_s_t_y_l_e choices of the individual and society. According to the _W_o_r_l_d_ _H_e_a_l_t_h

environment, the physical environment, and the person's individual

_[_1_2_]
The concept of the "health field," as distinct from _m_e_d_i_c_a_l_ _c_a_r_e, emerged from
the Lalonde report from Canada. The report identified three interdependent
fields as key determinants of an individual's health. These are:_[_1_0_]
    * Lifestyle: the aggregation of personal decisions (i.e., over which the
      individual has control) that can be said to contribute to, or cause,
      illness or death;
    * Environmental: all matters related to health external to the _h_u_m_a_n_ _b_o_d_y
      and over which the individual has little or no control;
    * Biomedical: all aspects of health, physical and mental, developed within
      the human body as influenced by genetic make-up.
The maintenance and promotion of health is achieved through different
combination of physical, _m_e_n_t_a_l, and social well-being, together sometimes
referred to as the "health triangle."_[_1_3_]_[_1_4_] The WHO's 1986 _O_t_t_a_w_a_ _C_h_a_r_t_e_r_ _f_o_r
_H_e_a_l_t_h_ _P_r_o_m_o_t_i_o_n further stated that health is not just a state, but also "a
resource for everyday life, not the objective of living. Health is a positive
concept emphasizing social and personal resources, as well as physical
capacities."_[_1_5_]
Focusing more on lifestyle issues and their relationships with functional
health, data from the Alameda County Study suggested that people can improve
their health via _e_x_e_r_c_i_s_e, enough _s_l_e_e_p, maintaining a healthy _b_o_d_y_ _w_e_i_g_h_t,
limiting _a_l_c_o_h_o_l use, and avoiding _s_m_o_k_i_n_g._[_1_6_] The ability to adapt and to
self manage have been suggested as core components of human health._[_1_7_]
The environment is often cited as an important factor influencing the health
status of individuals. This includes characteristics of the _n_a_t_u_r_a_l
_e_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t, the _b_u_i_l_t_ _e_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t, and the _s_o_c_i_a_l_ _e_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t. Factors such as
clean _w_a_t_e_r and _a_i_r, adequate _h_o_u_s_i_n_g, and safe communities and _r_o_a_d_s all have
been found to contribute to good health, especially to the health of infants
and children._[_8_]_[_1_8_] Some studies have shown that a lack of neighborhood
recreational spaces including natural environment leads to lower levels of
personal satisfaction and higher levels of _o_b_e_s_i_t_y, linked to lower overall
health and well being._[_1_9_] This suggests that the positive health benefits of
natural space in urban neighborhoods should be taken into account in _p_u_b_l_i_c
_p_o_l_i_c_y and land use.
_G_e_n_e_t_i_c_s, or inherited traits from parents, also play a role in determining the
health status of individuals and populations. This can encompass both the
_p_r_e_d_i_s_p_o_s_i_t_i_o_n to certain diseases and health conditions, as well as the habits
and behaviors individuals develop through the lifestyle of their _f_a_m_i_l_i_e_s. For
example, genetics may play a role in the manner in which people cope with
_s_t_r_e_s_s, either mental, emotional or physical (One difficulty is the issue
raised by the _d_e_b_a_t_e over the relative strengths of genetics and other factors;
interactions between genetics and environment may be of particular
importance.).

absence of mental illness.
Mental Illness is described as 'the spectrum of cognitive, emotional, and
behavioural conditions that interfere with social and emotional wellbeing and
the lives and productivity of people. Having a mental Illness can seriously
impair; temporarily or permanently, the mental functioning of a person. Other
terms include: 'mental health problem', 'illness', 'disorder', 'dysfunction'.

_H_e_a_l_t_h_ _s_c_i_e_n_c_e is the branch of science focused on health. There are two main
approaches to health science: the study and _r_e_s_e_a_r_c_h of the _b_o_d_y and health-
related issues to understand how humans (and animals) function, and the
application of that knowledge to improve health and to prevent and cure
_d_i_s_e_a_s_e_s and other physical and mental impairments. The science builds on many
sub-fields, including _b_i_o_l_o_g_y, _b_i_o_c_h_e_m_i_s_t_r_y, _p_h_y_s_i_c_s, _e_p_i_d_e_m_i_o_l_o_g_y,

understand and improve human health through applications in areas such as
_h_e_a_l_t_h_ _e_d_u_c_a_t_i_o_n, _b_i_o_m_e_d_i_c_a_l_ _e_n_g_i_n_e_e_r_i_n_g, _b_i_o_t_e_c_h_n_o_l_o_g_y and _p_u_b_l_i_c_ _h_e_a_l_t_h.
Organized interventions to improve health based on the principles and

Postage stamp, _N_e_w_ _Z_e_a_l_a_n_d, 1933. Public health has been promoted ‚Äì and
depicted ‚Äì in a wide variety of ways.
Public health has been described as "the science and art of preventing disease,
prolonging life and promoting health through the organized efforts and informed
choices of society, organizations, public and private, communities and
individuals."_[_2_2_] It is concerned with threats to the overall health of a
community based on _p_o_p_u_l_a_t_i_o_n_ _h_e_a_l_t_h analysis. The population in question can
be as small as a handful of people or as large as all the inhabitants of
several continents (for instance, in the case of a _p_a_n_d_e_m_i_c). Public health has
many sub-fields, but typically includes the interdisciplinary categories of
_e_p_i_d_e_m_i_o_l_o_g_y, _b_i_o_s_t_a_t_i_s_t_i_c_s and _h_e_a_l_t_h_ _s_e_r_v_i_c_e_s. _E_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t_a_l_ _h_e_a_l_t_h,
_c_o_m_m_u_n_i_t_y_ _h_e_a_l_t_h, _b_e_h_a_v_i_o_r_a_l_ _h_e_a_l_t_h, and _o_c_c_u_p_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _h_e_a_l_t_h are also important
areas of public health.
The focus of public health interventions is to prevent and manage diseases,
injuries and other health conditions through surveillance of cases and the
_p_r_o_m_o_t_i_o_n_ _o_f_ _h_e_a_l_t_h_y_ _b_e_h_a_v_i_o_r, _c_o_m_m_u_n_i_t_i_e_s, and (in aspects relevant to human
health) _e_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t_s. Its aim is to prevent health problems from happening or
re-occurring by implementing _e_d_u_c_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _p_r_o_g_r_a_m_s, developing _p_o_l_i_c_i_e_s,
administering services, and conducting _r_e_s_e_a_r_c_h._[_2_3_] In many cases, treating a
disease or controlling a _p_a_t_h_o_g_e_n can be vital to preventing it in others, such
as during an _o_u_t_b_r_e_a_k. _V_a_c_c_i_n_a_t_i_o_n programs and distribution of _c_o_n_d_o_m_s to
prevent the spread of _c_o_m_m_u_n_i_c_a_b_l_e_ _d_i_s_e_a_s_e_s are examples of common preventive
public health measures, as are educational campaigns to promote vaccination and
the use of condoms (including overcoming resistance to such).
Public health also takes various actions to limit the health disparities
between different areas of the _c_o_u_n_t_r_y and, in some cases, the _c_o_n_t_i_n_e_n_t or
_w_o_r_l_d. One issue is the access of individuals and communities to health care in
terms of financial, geographical or sociocultural constraints to accessing and
using services.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d] Applications of the public health system
include the areas of _m_a_t_e_r_n_a_l and child health, health services administration,
emergency response, and prevention and control of _i_n_f_e_c_t_i_o_u_s and _c_h_r_o_n_i_c
_d_i_s_e_a_s_e_s.
The great positive impact of public health programs is widely acknowledged. Due
in part to the policies and actions developed through public health, the 20th
century registered a decrease in the mortality rates for _i_n_f_a_n_t_s and _c_h_i_l_d_r_e_n
and a continual increase in _l_i_f_e_ _e_x_p_e_c_t_a_n_c_y in most parts of the world. For
example, it is estimated that life expectancy has increased for Americans by
thirty years since 1900,_[_2_4_] and worldwide by six years since 1990._[_2_5_]

Personal health depends partially on the active, passive, and assisted cues
people observe and adopt about their own health. These include personal actions
for preventing or minimizing the effects of a disease, usually a chronic
condition, through _i_n_t_e_g_r_a_t_i_v_e_ _c_a_r_e. They also include personal _h_y_g_i_e_n_e
practices to prevent infection and illness, such as _b_a_t_h_i_n_g and _w_a_s_h_i_n_g_ _h_a_n_d_s

_s_a_f_e_l_y; and many others. The information gleaned from personal _o_b_s_e_r_v_a_t_i_o_n_s_ _o_f
_d_a_i_l_y_ _l_i_v_i_n_g ‚Äì such as about sleep patterns, exercise behavior, nutritional
intake, and environmental features ‚Äì may be used to inform personal decisions
and actions (e.g., "I feel tired in the morning so I am going to try sleeping
on a different pillow"), as well as clinical decisions and treatment plans
(e.g., a patient who notices his or her shoes are tighter than usual may be
having exacerbation of left-sided heart failure, and may require diuretic
medication to reduce fluid overload)._[_2_6_]
Personal health also depends partially on the social structure of a person's
life. The maintenance of strong _s_o_c_i_a_l_ _r_e_l_a_t_i_o_n_s_h_i_p_s, _v_o_l_u_n_t_e_e_r_i_n_g, and other
social activities have been linked to positive mental health and even increased
longevity. One American study among _s_e_n_i_o_r_s over age 70, found that frequent
volunteering was associated with reduced risk of dying compared with older
persons who did not volunteer, regardless of physical health status._[_2_7_]
Another study from Singapore reported that volunteering retirees had
significantly better _c_o_g_n_i_t_i_v_e_ _p_e_r_f_o_r_m_a_n_c_e scores, fewer _d_e_p_r_e_s_s_i_v_e_ _s_y_m_p_t_o_m_s,
and better mental well-being and life satisfaction than non-volunteering
retirees._[_2_8_]
Prolonged _p_s_y_c_h_o_l_o_g_i_c_a_l_ _s_t_r_e_s_s may negatively impact health, and has been cited
as a factor in _c_o_g_n_i_t_i_v_e_ _i_m_p_a_i_r_m_e_n_t with aging, depressive illness, and
expression of disease._[_2_9_] _S_t_r_e_s_s_ _m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t is the application of methods to
either reduce stress or increase tolerance to stress. _R_e_l_a_x_a_t_i_o_n_ _t_e_c_h_n_i_q_u_e_s are
physical methods used to relieve stress. Psychological methods include
_c_o_g_n_i_t_i_v_e_ _t_h_e_r_a_p_y, _m_e_d_i_t_a_t_i_o_n, and _p_o_s_i_t_i_v_e_ _t_h_i_n_k_i_n_g, which work by reducing
response to stress. Improving relevant skills, such as _p_r_o_b_l_e_m_ _s_o_l_v_i_n_g and _t_i_m_e
_m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t skills, reduces uncertainty and builds confidence, which also
reduces the reaction to stress-causing situations where those skills are
applicable.

In addition to _s_a_f_e_t_y risks, many jobs also present risks of disease, illness,

As the number of _s_e_r_v_i_c_e_ _s_e_c_t_o_r jobs has risen in developed countries, more and
more jobs have become _s_e_d_e_n_t_a_r_y, presenting a different array of health

to _s_t_r_e_s_s and _o_v_e_r_w_o_r_k in many countries have further complicated the
