A llaawwssuuiitt or (very rarely) "ssuuiitt iinn llaaww"_[_1_] is a civil action brought in a
_c_o_u_r_t of law in which a _p_l_a_i_n_t_i_f_f, a party who claims to have incurred loss as
a result of a _d_e_f_e_n_d_a_n_t's actions, demands a _l_e_g_a_l or _e_q_u_i_t_a_b_l_e_ _r_e_m_e_d_y. The
_d_e_f_e_n_d_a_n_t is required to respond to the plaintiff's _c_o_m_p_l_a_i_n_t. If the plaintiff
is successful, _j_u_d_g_m_e_n_t is in the plaintiff's favor, and a variety of _c_o_u_r_t
_o_r_d_e_r_s may be issued to enforce a _r_i_g_h_t, award damages, or impose a temporary
or permanent _i_n_j_u_n_c_t_i_o_n to prevent an act or compel an act. A _d_e_c_l_a_r_a_t_o_r_y
_j_u_d_g_m_e_n_t may be issued to prevent future _l_e_g_a_l_ _d_i_s_p_u_t_e_s.
A lawsuit may involve _d_i_s_p_u_t_e_ _r_e_s_o_l_u_t_i_o_n of _p_r_i_v_a_t_e_ _l_a_w issues between
_i_n_d_i_v_i_d_u_a_l_s, _b_u_s_i_n_e_s_s_ _e_n_t_i_t_i_e_s or _n_o_n_-_p_r_o_f_i_t_ _o_r_g_a_n_i_z_a_t_i_o_n_s. A lawsuit may also
enable the _s_t_a_t_e to be treated as if it were a private party in a _c_i_v_i_l_ _c_a_s_e,
as plaintiff, or _d_e_f_e_n_d_a_n_t regarding an injury, or may provide the state with a
civil cause of action to enforce certain laws.
The conduct of a lawsuit is called lliittiiggaattiioonn. The plaintiffs and defendants
are called litigants and the attorneys representing them are called litigators.

Rules of criminal or _c_i_v_i_l_ _p_r_o_c_e_d_u_r_e govern the conduct of a lawsuit in the
_c_o_m_m_o_n_ _l_a_w _a_d_v_e_r_s_a_r_i_a_l_ _s_y_s_t_e_m of dispute resolution. Procedural rules are
additionally constrained/informed by separate _s_t_a_t_u_t_o_r_y_ _l_a_w_s, case law, and
constitutional provisions that define the rights of the parties to a lawsuit
(see especially _d_u_e_ _p_r_o_c_e_s_s), though the rules generally reflect this legal
context on their face. The details of procedure differ greatly from
jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and often from court to court within the same
jurisdiction. The rules are very important for litigants to know, however,
because they dictate the timing and progression of the lawsuit‚Äîwhat may be
filed and when, to obtain what result. Failure to comply with the procedural
rules may result in serious limitations upon the ability to present claims or
defenses at any subsequent trial, or even dismissal of the lawsuit.
Though the majority of lawsuits are settled and never reach trial,_[_3_] they can
be very complicated to litigate. This is particularly true in _f_e_d_e_r_a_l systems,
where a federal court may be applying state law (e.g., the _E_r_i_e_ _d_o_c_t_r_i_n_e in the
_U_n_i_t_e_d_ _S_t_a_t_e_s) or vice versa, or one state applying the law of another, and
where additionally it may not be clear which level (or location) of court
actually has _j_u_r_i_s_d_i_c_t_i_o_n over the claim or _p_e_r_s_o_n_a_l_ _j_u_r_i_s_d_i_c_t_i_o_n over the
defendant, or whether the plaintiff has _s_t_a_n_d_i_n_g to participate in a lawsuit.
About 98 percent of civil cases in the _U_n_i_t_e_d_ _S_t_a_t_e_s_ _f_e_d_e_r_a_l_ _c_o_u_r_t_s are
resolved without a trial. Domestic courts are also often called upon to apply
foreign law, or to act upon foreign defendants, over whom they may not, as a
practical matter, even have the ability to enforce a judgment if the
defendant's assets are outside their reach.
Lawsuits become additionally complicated as more parties become involved (see
_j_o_i_n_d_e_r). Within a "single" lawsuit, there can be any number of claims and
defenses (all based on numerous laws) between any number of plaintiffs or
defendants, each of whom can bring any number of cross-claims and counterclaims
against each other, and even bring additional parties into the suit on either
side after it progresses. However, courts typically have some power to sever
claims and parties into separate actions if it is more efficient to do so, such
as if there is not a sufficient overlap of factual issues between the various
associates.

Main article: _P_l_e_a_d_i_n_g
A lawsuit begins when a complaint is filed with the court. This complaint
states that one or more plaintiffs seeks damages or _e_q_u_i_t_a_b_l_e_ _r_e_l_i_e_f from one
or more stated defendants, and identifies the legal and factual bases for doing
so. It is important that the "plaintiff selects the proper venue with the
proper jurisdiction to bring his lawsuit." The clerk of a court signs or stamps
the court seal upon a _s_u_m_m_o_n_s, which is then _s_e_r_v_e_d by the plaintiff upon the
defendant, together with a copy of the complaint. This service notifies the
defendants that they are being sued and that they have a specific time limit to
file a response. By providing a copy of the complaint, the service also
notifies the defendants of the nature of the claims. Once the defendants are
served with the summons and complaint, they are subject to a time limit to file
an _a_n_s_w_e_r stating their defenses to the plaintiff's claims, including any
challenges to the court's jurisdiction, and any counterclaims they wish to
assert against the plaintiff.
In a handful of jurisdictions (notably, the _U_._S_._ _s_t_a_t_e of _N_e_w_ _Y_o_r_k) a lawsuit
begins when one or more plaintiffs properly serve a summons and complaint upon
the defendant(s). In such jurisdictions, nothing must be filed with the court
until a dispute develops requiring actual judicial intervention.
If the defendant chooses to file an answer within the time permitted, the
answer must address each of the plaintiffs' allegations by admitting the
allegation, denying it, or pleading a lack of sufficient information to admit
or deny the allegation. Some jurisdictions, like California, still authorize
general denials of each and every allegation in the complaint. At the time the
defendant files an answer, the defendant also raises all "affirmative"
defenses. The defendant may also assert counterclaims for damages or equitable
relief against the plaintiff, and in the case of "compulsory counterclaims,"
must do so or risk having the counterclaim barred in any subsequent proceeding.
The defendant may also file a "_t_h_i_r_d_ _p_a_r_t_y_ _c_o_m_p_l_a_i_n_t" seeking to join another
party or parties in the action in the belief that those parties may be liable
for some or all of the plaintiff's claimed damages. Filing an answer "joins the
cause" and moves the case into the pre-trial phase.
Instead of filing an answer within the time specified in the summons, the
defendant can choose to dispute the validity of the complaint by filing a
_d_e_m_u_r_r_e_r (in the handful of jurisdictions where that is still allowed) or one
or more "pre-answer motions," such as a motion to dismiss. The motion must be
filed within the time period specified in the summons for an answer. If all
such motions are denied by the trial court, and the defendant loses on all
appeals from such denials (if that option is available), then the defendant
must file an answer.
Usually the _p_l_e_a_d_i_n_g_s are drafted by a _l_a_w_y_e_r, but in many courts persons can

The early stages of the lawsuit may involve initial disclosures of evidence by
each party and _d_i_s_c_o_v_e_r_y, which is the structured exchange of _e_v_i_d_e_n_c_e and
_s_t_a_t_e_m_e_n_t_s between the parties. Discovery is meant to eliminate surprises and
clarify what the lawsuit is about, and to make the parties realize they should
settle or drop frivolous claims and defenses. At this point the parties may
also engage in pretrial motions to exclude or include particular legal or
factual issues before trial.
At the close of discovery, the parties may either pick a _j_u_r_y and then have a
_t_r_i_a_l_ _b_y_ _j_u_r_y or the case may proceed as a bench trial heard only by the judge
if the parties waive a jury trial or if the right to a jury trial is not
guaranteed for their particular claim (such as those under _e_q_u_i_t_y in the U.S.)
or for any lawsuits within their jurisdiction.

At trial, each person presents witnesses and enters evidence into the record,
at the close of which the judge or jury renders their decision. Generally
speaking, the plaintiff has the _b_u_r_d_e_n_ _o_f_ _p_r_o_o_f in making his claims. The
defendant may have the burden of proof on other issues, however, such as
_a_f_f_i_r_m_a_t_i_v_e_ _d_e_f_e_n_s_e_s. The attorneys will devise a _t_r_i_a_l_ _s_t_r_a_t_e_g_y that ensures
they meet the necessary elements of their case or (when the opposing party has
the burden of proof) to ensure the opponent will not be able to meet his or her
burden.
There are numerous motions that either party can file throughout the lawsuit to
terminate it "prematurely"‚Äîbefore submission to the judge or jury for final
consideration. These motions attempt to persuade the judge, through legal
argument and sometimes accompanying evidence, that because there is no
reasonable way that the other party could legally win, there is no sense in
continuing with the trial. Motions for _s_u_m_m_a_r_y_ _j_u_d_g_m_e_n_t, for example, can
usually be brought before, after, or during the actual presentation of the
case. Motions can also be brought after the close of a trial to undo a jury
verdict contrary to law or against the weight of the evidence, or to convince
the judge to change the decision or grant a new trial.
Also, at any time during this process from the filing of the complaint to the
final judgment, the plaintiff may withdraw the complaint and end the whole
matter, or the defendant may agree to a settlement. If the case settles, the
parties might choose to enter into a stipulated judgment with the settlement
agreement attached, or the plaintiff may simply file a _v_o_l_u_n_t_a_r_y_ _d_i_s_m_i_s_s_a_l, so
that the settlement agreement is never entered into the court record.

After a ffiinnaall decision has been made, either party or both may _a_p_p_e_a_l from the
judgment if they believe there had been a procedural error made by the trial
court. Even the prevailing party may appeal, if, for example, they wanted a
larger award than was granted. The _a_p_p_e_l_l_a_t_e_ _c_o_u_r_t (which may be structured as
an intermediate appellate court) and/or a higher court then affirms the
judgment, declines to hear it (which effectively affirms it), reverses‚Äîor
vacates and remands, which involves sending the lawsuit back to the lower trial
court to address an unresolved issue, or possibly for a whole new trial. Some
lawsuits go up and down the appeals ladder repeatedly before finally
resolution.
Some jurisdictions, notably the United States, prevent parties from
relitigating the facts on appeal, due to a history of unscrupulous lawyers
deliberately reserving such issues in order to ambush each other in the
appellate courts (the "invited error" problem). The idea is that it is more
efficient to force all parties to fully litigate all relevant issues of fact
before the trial court. Thus, a party who does not raise an issue of fact at
the trial court level generally cannot raise it on appeal. Furthermore,
appellate courts in such jurisdictions will not question the facts as found by
a judge or jury in the trial court, as long as there was some evidence in the
record to support such findings‚Äîand even if the appellate judge would not
personally have believed the underlying evidence if present when it was entered
into the record.
When the lawsuit is finally resolved, or the allotted time to appeal has
expired, the matter is _r_e_s_ _j_u_d_i_c_a_t_a. The plaintiff may not bring another action
based on the same claim again. In addition, other parties who later attempt to
re-litigate a matter already ruled on in a previous lawsuit will be _e_s_t_o_p_p_e_d
from doing so._[_4_]
******** EEnnffoorrcceemmeenntt[[_ee_dd_ii_tt_ _ss_oo_uu_rr_cc_ee¬¬ || _ee_dd_ii_tt]] ********
When a final judgment is entered, the plaintiff is usually barred under the
doctrine of _r_e_s_ _j_u_d_i_c_a_t_a from trying to bring the same or similar claim again
against that defendant, or from relitigating any of the issues, even under
different legal claims or theories. This prevents a new trial of the same case
with a different result, or if the plaintiff won, a repeat trial that merely
multiplies the judgment against the defendant.
If the judgment is for the plaintiff, then the defendant must comply under
penalty of law with the judgment, which is usually a monetary award. If the
defendant fails to pay, the court has various powers to seize any of the
defendant's assets located within its jurisdiction, such as:
    * _W_r_i_t_ _o_f_ _e_x_e_c_u_t_i_o_n
    * _B_a_n_k_ _a_c_c_o_u_n_t_ _g_a_r_n_i_s_h_m_e_n_t
    * _L_i_e_n_s
    * _W_a_g_e_ _g_a_r_n_i_s_h_m_e_n_t
If all assets are located elsewhere, the plaintiff must file another suit in
the appropriate court to seek enforcement of the other court's previous
judgment. This can be a difficult task when crossing from a court in one state
or nation to another, though courts tend to grant each other respect when there
is not a clear legal rule to the contrary. A defendant who has no assets in any
jurisdiction is said to be "judgment-proof."_[_5_] The term is generally a
colloquialism to describe an impecunious defendant.
Indigent judgment-proof defendants are no longer imprisoned; debtor's prisons
have been outlawed by statute, constitutional amendment, or international human
rights treaties in the vast majority of common law jurisdictions.

During the 18th and 19th centuries, it was common for lawyers to speak of
bringing an "action" at law and a "suit" in _e_q_u_i_t_y. An example of that
distinction survives today in the text of the _C_i_v_i_l_ _R_i_g_h_t_s_ _A_c_t_ _o_f_ _1_8_7_1. The
fusion of common law and equity in England in the _J_u_d_i_c_a_t_u_r_e_ _A_c_t_s of 1873 and
1875 led to the collapse of that distinction, so it became possible to speak of
a "lawsuit." In the _U_n_i_t_e_d_ _S_t_a_t_e_s, the _F_e_d_e_r_a_l_ _R_u_l_e_s_ _o_f_ _C_i_v_i_l_ _P_r_o_c_e_d_u_r_e (1938)
abolished the distinction between actions at law and suits in equity in federal
practice, in favor of a single form referred to as a "civil action."
In _E_n_g_l_a_n_d_ _a_n_d_ _W_a_l_e_s the term "claim" is far more common; the person initiating
proceedings is called the _c_l_a_i_m_a_n_t.
American terminology is slightly different, in that the term "claim" refers
only to a particular count (or cause of action) in a lawsuit. Americans also
use "claim" to describe a demand filed with an insurer or administrative
agency. If the claim is denied, then the claimant (or policyholder or
applicant) files a lawsuit with the courts and becomes a plaintiff.
In medieval times, both "action" and "suit" had the approximate meaning of some
kind of legal proceeding, but an action terminated when a judgment was
rendered, while a suit also included the execution of the judgment.

In the United States, plaintiffs and defendants who lack financial resources
for _l_i_t_i_g_a_t_i_o_n or other legal expenses may be able to obtain _l_e_g_a_l_ _f_i_n_a_n_c_i_n_g.
Legal financing companies can provide a cash advance to litigants in return for
a share of the ultimate _s_e_t_t_l_e_m_e_n_t or award. If the case ultimately loses, the
litigant does not have to pay any of the money funded back. _L_e_g_a_l_ _f_i_n_a_n_c_i_n_g is
different from a typical bank _l_o_a_n. The legal financing company does not look
at credit history or employment history. Litigants do not have to repay the
cash advance with monthly payments, but do have to fill out an application so
that the legal financing company can review the merits of the case.
_L_e_g_a_l_ _f_i_n_a_n_c_i_n_g can be a practical means for litigants to obtain financing
while they wait for a monetary settlement or an award in their _p_e_r_s_o_n_a_l_ _i_n_j_u_r_y,
_w_o_r_k_e_r_s_'_ _c_o_m_p_e_n_s_a_t_i_o_n, or _c_i_v_i_l_ _r_i_g_h_t_s lawsuit. Often, plaintiffs who were
injured or forced to leave their jobs still have _m_o_r_t_g_a_g_e_s, rent, medical
expenses, or other bills to pay. Other times, litigants may simply need money
to pay for the costs of litigation and attorneys' fees. For this reason, many
litigants turn to reputable legal financing companies to apply for a cash
advance to help pay for bills.
Defendants, civil rights organizations, public interest organizations, and
government public officials can set up an account to pay for litigation costs
and legal expenses. These _l_e_g_a_l_ _d_e_f_e_n_s_e_ _f_u_n_d_s can have large membership counts
where the members contribute to the fund. Unlike legal financing from legal
financing companies, legal defense funds provide a separate account for
litigation rather than a one-time cash advancement, though both are used for
purposes of financing litigation and legal costs.
