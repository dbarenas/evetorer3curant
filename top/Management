MMaannaaggeemmeenntt in all _b_u_s_i_n_e_s_s and organizational activities is the act of
coordinating the efforts of people to accomplish desired goals and _o_b_j_e_c_t_i_v_e_s
using available resources efficiently and effectively. Management comprises
_p_l_a_n_n_i_n_g, _o_r_g_a_n_i_z_i_n_g, _s_t_a_f_f_i_n_g, _l_e_a_d_i_n_g or directing, and _c_o_n_t_r_o_l_l_i_n_g an
_o_r_g_a_n_i_z_a_t_i_o_n (a group of one or more people or entities) or effort for the
purpose of accomplishing a goal. _R_e_s_o_u_r_c_i_n_g encompasses the deployment and
manipulation of _h_u_m_a_n_ _r_e_s_o_u_r_c_e_s, _f_i_n_a_n_c_i_a_l resources, _t_e_c_h_n_o_l_o_g_i_c_a_l resources,

Since organizations can be viewed as _s_y_s_t_e_m_s, management can also be defined as
human action, including design, to facilitate the production of useful outcomes
from a system. This view opens the opportunity to 'manage' oneself, a
prerequisite to attempting to manage others.

The verb manage comes from the _I_t_a_l_i_a_n maneggiare (to handle, especially
tools), which derives from the _L_a_t_i_n word manus (hand). The French word
mesnagement (later mÃ©nagement) influenced the development in meaning of the
English word management in the 17th and 18th centuries._[_1_]

Views on the definition and scope of management include:
    * Management defined as the organization and coordination of the activities
      of an enterprise in accordance with certain policies and in achievement
      of clearly defined objectives
    * _F_r_e_d_m_u_n_d_ _M_a_l_i_k defines as MMaannaaggeemmeenntt iiss tthhee ttrraannssffoorrmmaattiioonn ooff rreessoouurrcceess

    * Management included as one of the factors of production - along with
      machines, materials and money
    * _P_e_t_e_r_ _D_r_u_c_k_e_r (1909â€“2005) sees the basic task of a management as
      twofold: _m_a_r_k_e_t_i_n_g and _i_n_n_o_v_a_t_i_o_n. Nevertheless, innovation is also
      linked to marketing (product innovation is a central strategic marketing
      issue). Peter Drucker identifies marketing as a key essence for business
      success, but management and marketing are generally understood[_b_y_ _w_h_o_m_?]
      as two different branches of _b_u_s_i_n_e_s_s_ _a_d_m_i_n_i_s_t_r_a_t_i_o_n_ _k_n_o_w_l_e_d_g_e.

    * As a discipline, management comprises the interlocking functions of
      formulating corporate policy and organizing, planning, controlling, and
      directing a firm's resources to achieve a policy's objectives
    * The size of management can range from one person in a small firm to
      hundreds or thousands of managers in multinational companies.
    * In large firms, the board of directors formulates the policy that the
      chief executive officer implements._[_2_]

Management involves the manipulation of the human capital of an enterprise to
contribute to the success of the enterprise. This implies effective
communication: an enterprise environment (as opposed to a physical or
mechanical mechanism), implies human motivation and implies some sort of
successful progress or system outcome. As such, management is not the
manipulation of a mechanism (machine or automated program), not the herding of
animals, and can occur in both a legal as well as illegal enterprise or
environment. Based on this, management must have humans, communication, and a
positive enterprise endeavor. Plans, measurements, motivational psychological
tools, goals, and economic measures (profit, etc.) may or may not be necessary
components for there to be management. At first, one views management
functionally, such as measuring quantity, adjusting _p_l_a_n_s, meeting _g_o_a_l_s. This
applies even in situations where planning does not take place. From this
perspective, _H_e_n_r_i_ _F_a_y_o_l (1841â€“1925)_[_3_] considers management to consist of
six _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n_s:
   1. forecasting
   2. planning
   3. organizing
   4. commanding
   5. coordinating
   6. controlling
Fayol was one of the most influential contributors to modern concepts of
management.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]
In another way of thinking, _M_a_r_y_ _P_a_r_k_e_r_ _F_o_l_l_e_t_t (1868â€“1933), defined
management as "the art of getting things done through people". She described
management as philosophy._[_4_]
Some people[_w_h_i_c_h_?], however, find this definition useful but far too narrow.
The phrase "management is what managers do" occurs widely, suggesting the
difficulty of defining management, the shifting nature of definitions and the
connection of managerial practices with the existence of a _m_a_n_a_g_e_r_i_a_l_ _c_a_d_r_e or
_c_l_a_s_s.
One habit of thought regards management as equivalent to "business
administration" and thus excludes management in places outside _c_o_m_m_e_r_c_e, as for
example in _c_h_a_r_i_t_i_e_s and in the _p_u_b_l_i_c_ _s_e_c_t_o_r. More broadly, however, every
organization must manage its work, people, processes, technology, etc. to
maximize effectiveness. Nonetheless, many people refer to university
departments that teach management as "_b_u_s_i_n_e_s_s_ _s_c_h_o_o_l_s". Some institutions
(such as the _H_a_r_v_a_r_d_ _B_u_s_i_n_e_s_s_ _S_c_h_o_o_l) use that name while others (such as the
_Y_a_l_e_ _S_c_h_o_o_l_ _o_f_ _M_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t) employ the more inclusive term "management".
English speakers may also use the term "management" or "the management" as a
collective word describing the managers of an organization, for example of a
_c_o_r_p_o_r_a_t_i_o_n. Historically this use of the term often contrasted with the term
_"_L_a_b_o_r_" - referring to those being managed.

In for-profit work, management has as its primary function the satisfaction of
a range of _s_t_a_k_e_h_o_l_d_e_r_s. This typically involves making a profit (for the
shareholders), creating valued products at a reasonable cost (for customers),
and providing rewarding employment opportunities for employees. In nonprofit
management, add the importance of keeping the faith of donors. In most models
of management and _g_o_v_e_r_n_a_n_c_e, shareholders vote for the _b_o_a_r_d_ _o_f_ _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_s, and
the board then hires senior management. Some organizations have experimented
with other methods (such as employee-voting models) of selecting or reviewing
managers, but this is rare.
In the _p_u_b_l_i_c_ _s_e_c_t_o_r of countries constituted as _r_e_p_r_e_s_e_n_t_a_t_i_v_e_ _d_e_m_o_c_r_a_c_i_e_s,
voters elect politicians to public office. Such politicians hire many managers
and administrators, and in some countries like the _U_n_i_t_e_d_ _S_t_a_t_e_s political
appointees lose their jobs on the election of a new president/governor/mayor.

Difficulties arise in tracing the history of management. Some see it (by
definition) as a late modern (in the sense of late _m_o_d_e_r_n_i_t_y)
conceptualization. On those terms it cannot have a pre-modern history, only
harbingers (such as _s_t_e_w_a_r_d_s). Others, however, detect management-like-thought
back to _S_u_m_e_r_i_a_n traders and to the builders of the pyramids of _a_n_c_i_e_n_t_ _E_g_y_p_t.
Slave-owners through the centuries faced the problems of exploiting/motivating
a dependent but sometimes unenthusiastic or recalcitrant workforce, but many
pre-industrial _e_n_t_e_r_p_r_i_s_e_s, given their small scale, did not feel compelled to
face the issues of management systematically. However, innovations such as the
spread of _H_i_n_d_u_-_A_r_a_b_i_c_ _n_u_m_e_r_a_l_s (5th to 15th centuries) and the codification of
_d_o_u_b_l_e_-_e_n_t_r_y_ _b_o_o_k_-_k_e_e_p_i_n_g (1494) provided _t_o_o_l_s for management assessment,
planning and control.
Given the scale of most commercial operations and the lack of mechanized
record-keeping and recording before the _i_n_d_u_s_t_r_i_a_l_ _r_e_v_o_l_u_t_i_o_n, it made sense
for most _o_w_n_e_r_s of enterprises in those times to carry out management functions
by and for themselves. But with growing size and complexity of organizations,
the split between owners (individuals, industrial dynasties or groups of
_s_h_a_r_e_h_o_l_d_e_r_s) and day-to-day managers (independent specialists in planning and
control) gradually became more common.

By about 1900 one finds managers trying to place their theories on what they
regarded as a thoroughly scientific basis (see _s_c_i_e_n_t_i_s_m for perceived
limitations of this belief). Examples include _H_e_n_r_y_ _R_._ _T_o_w_n_e's Science of
management in the 1890s, _F_r_e_d_e_r_i_c_k_ _W_i_n_s_l_o_w_ _T_a_y_l_o_r's _T_h_e_ _P_r_i_n_c_i_p_l_e_s_ _o_f

management _t_e_x_t_b_o_o_k in 1911. In 1912 _Y_o_i_c_h_i_ _U_e_n_o introduced _T_a_y_l_o_r_i_s_m to _J_a_p_a_n

_C_h_u_r_c_h described the various branches of management and their inter-
relationships. In the early 20th century, people like Ordway Tead
(1891â€“1973), _W_a_l_t_e_r_ _S_c_o_t_t and J. Mooney applied the principles of _p_s_y_c_h_o_l_o_g_y
to management, while other writers, such as _E_l_t_o_n_ _M_a_y_o (1880â€“1949), _M_a_r_y
_P_a_r_k_e_r_ _F_o_l_l_e_t_t (1868â€“1933), _C_h_e_s_t_e_r_ _B_a_r_n_a_r_d (1886â€“1961), _M_a_x_ _W_e_b_e_r

approached the phenomenon of management from a _s_o_c_i_o_l_o_g_i_c_a_l perspective.
_P_e_t_e_r_ _D_r_u_c_k_e_r (1909â€“2005) wrote one of the earliest books on applied
management: _C_o_n_c_e_p_t_ _o_f_ _t_h_e_ _C_o_r_p_o_r_a_t_i_o_n (published in 1946). It resulted from
_A_l_f_r_e_d_ _S_l_o_a_n (chairman of _G_e_n_e_r_a_l_ _M_o_t_o_r_s until 1956) commissioning a study of
the _o_r_g_a_n_i_s_a_t_i_o_n. Drucker went on to write 39 books, many in the same vein.
H. Dodge, _R_o_n_a_l_d_ _F_i_s_h_e_r (1890â€“1962), and Thornton C. Fry introduced
statistical techniques into management-studies. In the 1940s, _P_a_t_r_i_c_k_ _B_l_a_c_k_e_t_t
worked in the development of the applied mathematics _s_c_i_e_n_c_e of _o_p_e_r_a_t_i_o_n_s
_r_e_s_e_a_r_c_h, initially for military operations. Operations research, sometimes
known as "management science" (but distinct from Taylor's _s_c_i_e_n_t_i_f_i_c
_m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t), attempts to take a _s_c_i_e_n_t_i_f_i_c approach to solving decision
problems, and can be directly applied to multiple management problems,
particularly in the areas of _l_o_g_i_s_t_i_c_s and operations.
Some of the more recent_[_u_p_d_a_t_e_] developments include the _T_h_e_o_r_y_ _o_f_ _C_o_n_s_t_r_a_i_n_t_s,

_t_e_c_h_n_o_l_o_g_y-driven theories such as _a_g_i_l_e_ _s_o_f_t_w_a_r_e_ _d_e_v_e_l_o_p_m_e_n_t, as well as group
management theories such as _C_o_g_'_s_ _L_a_d_d_e_r.
As the general recognition of managers as a class solidified during the 20th
century and gave perceived practitioners of the art/science of management a
certain amount of prestige, so the way opened for _p_o_p_u_l_a_r_i_s_e_d_ _s_y_s_t_e_m_s_ _o_f
_m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t_ _i_d_e_a_s to peddle their wares. In this context many _m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t_ _f_a_d_s
may have had more to do with _p_o_p_ _p_s_y_c_h_o_l_o_g_y than with scientific theories of
management.
Towards the end of the 20th century, business management came to consist of six
separate branches, namely:
    * _H_u_m_a_n_ _r_e_s_o_u_r_c_e_ _m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t

In the 21st century observers find it increasingly difficult to subdivide
management into functional categories in this way. More and more processes
simultaneously involve several categories. Instead, one tends to think in terms
of the various processes, tasks, and objects subject to management.
Branches of management theory also exist relating to _n_o_n_p_r_o_f_i_t_s and to
government: such as _p_u_b_l_i_c_ _a_d_m_i_n_i_s_t_r_a_t_i_o_n, _p_u_b_l_i_c_ _m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t, and educational
management. Further, management programs related to _c_i_v_i_l_-_s_o_c_i_e_t_y organizations
have also spawned programs in _n_o_n_p_r_o_f_i_t management and _s_o_c_i_a_l_ _e_n_t_r_e_p_r_e_n_e_u_r_s_h_i_p.
Note that many of the assumptions made by management have come under attack
from _b_u_s_i_n_e_s_s_ _e_t_h_i_c_s viewpoints, _c_r_i_t_i_c_a_l_ _m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t_ _s_t_u_d_i_e_s, and _a_n_t_i_-
_c_o_r_p_o_r_a_t_e_ _a_c_t_i_v_i_s_m.
As one consequence, _w_o_r_k_p_l_a_c_e_ _d_e_m_o_c_r_a_c_y has become both more common, and more
advocated, in some places distributing all management functions among the
workers, each of whom takes on a portion of the work. However, these models
predate any current political issue, and may occur more naturally than does a
_c_o_m_m_a_n_d_ _h_i_e_r_a_r_c_h_y. All management embraces some degree democratic
principleâ€”in that in the long term, the majority of workers must support
management. Otherwise, they leave to find other work or go on strike. Despite
the move toward workplace democracy, command-and-control organization
structures remain commonplace as de facto organization structure. Indeed, the
entrenched nature of command-and-control is evident in the way that recent
layoffs have been conducted with management ranks affected far less than
employees at the lower levels. In some cases, management has even rewarded
itself with bonuses after laying off lower level workers._[_7_]

      because without motivation, employees cannot work effectively. If
      motivation does not take place in an organization, then employees may not

entire organization. They set a _t_o_n_e_ _a_t_ _t_h_e_ _t_o_p and develop _s_t_r_a_t_e_g_i_c_ _p_l_a_n_s,
company policies, and make decisions on the direction of the business. In
addition, top-level managers play a significant role in the mobilization of
outside resources and are accountable to the shareholders and general public.
The board of directors is typically primarily composed of non-executives which
owe a _f_i_d_u_c_i_a_r_y duty to shareholders and are not closely involved in the day-
to-day activities of the organization, although this varies depending on the
type (e.g., public versus private), size and culture of the organization. These
directors are theoretically liable for breaches of that duty and typically
insured under _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_s_ _a_n_d_ _o_f_f_i_c_e_r_s_ _l_i_a_b_i_l_i_t_y_ _i_n_s_u_r_a_n_c_e. _F_o_r_t_u_n_e_ _5_0_0 directors
are estimated to spend 4.4 hours per week on board duties, and median
compensation was $212,512 in 2010. The board sets corporate strategy, makes
major decisions such as major acquisitions,_[_1_2_] and hires, evaluates, and fires
the top-level manager (_C_h_i_e_f_ _E_x_e_c_u_t_i_v_e_ _O_f_f_i_c_e_r or CEO) and the CEO typically
hires other positions. However, board involvement in the hiring of other
positions such as the _C_h_i_e_f_ _F_i_n_a_n_c_i_a_l_ _O_f_f_i_c_e_r (CFO) has increased._[_1_3_] In 2013,
a survey of over 160 CEOs and directors of public and private companies found
that the top weaknesses of CEOs were "mentoring skills" and "board engagement",
and 10% of companies never evaluated the CEO._[_1_4_] The board may also have
certain employees (e.g., _i_n_t_e_r_n_a_l_ _a_u_d_i_t_o_r_s) report to them or directly hire
independent contractors; for example, the board (through the _a_u_d_i_t_ _c_o_m_m_i_t_t_e_e)
typically selects the _a_u_d_i_t_o_r.
Helpful skills of top management vary by the type of organization but typically
include_[_1_5_]a broad understanding competition, world economies, and politics. In
addition, the CEO is responsible for executing and determining (within the
board's framework) the broad policies of the organization. Executive management
accomplishes the day-to-day details, including: instructions for preparation of
department budgets, procedures, schedules; appointment of middle level
executives such as department managers; coordination of departments; media and
governmental relations; and shareholder communication.
