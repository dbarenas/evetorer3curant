OOppeerraattiioonnss mmaannaaggeemmeenntt is an area of _m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t concerned with overseeing,
designing, and controlling the process of _p_r_o_d_u_c_t_i_o_n and redesigning _b_u_s_i_n_e_s_s
_o_p_e_r_a_t_i_o_n_s in the production of _g_o_o_d_s or _s_e_r_v_i_c_e_s. It involves the
responsibility of ensuring that _b_u_s_i_n_e_s_s operations are _e_f_f_i_c_i_e_n_t in terms of
using as few resources as needed, and _e_f_f_e_c_t_i_v_e in terms of meeting customer
requirements. It is concerned with managing the process that converts inputs
(in the forms of _m_a_t_e_r_i_a_l_s, _l_a_b_o_r, and _e_n_e_r_g_y) into outputs (in the form of
goods and/or services). The relationship of operations management to _s_e_n_i_o_r
_m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t in commercial contexts can be compared to the relationship of _l_i_n_e
_o_f_f_i_c_e_r_s to highest-level senior officers in _m_i_l_i_t_a_r_y_ _s_c_i_e_n_c_e. The highest-
level officers shape the _ss_tt_rr_aa_tt_ee_gg_yy and revise it over time, while the line
officers make _t_a_c_t_i_c_a_l decisions in support of carrying out the strategy. In
business as in military affairs, the boundaries between levels are not always
distinct; tactical information dynamically informs strategy, and individual
people often move between roles over time.

According to the U.S. Department of Education, operations management is the
field concerned with managing and directing the physical and/or technical
functions of a _f_i_r_m or _o_r_g_a_n_i_z_a_t_i_o_n, particularly those relating to
development, production, and manufacturing. Operations management programs
typically include instruction in principles of general management,
manufacturing and production systems, plant management, equipment maintenance
management, production control, industrial labor relations and skilled trades
supervision, strategic manufacturing policy, systems analysis, productivity
analysis and cost control, and materials planning._[_1_]_[_2_] Management, including
operations management, is like _e_n_g_i_n_e_e_r_i_n_g in that it blends art with _a_p_p_l_i_e_d
_s_c_i_e_n_c_e. People skills, creativity, rational analysis, and knowledge of
_t_e_c_h_n_o_l_o_g_y are all required for success.

Marshall's _f_l_a_x mill in _H_o_l_b_e_c_k
Before the _F_i_r_s_t_ _i_n_d_u_s_t_r_i_a_l_ _r_e_v_o_l_u_t_i_o_n work was mainly done through two
systems: _d_o_m_e_s_t_i_c_ _s_y_s_t_e_m and _c_r_a_f_t_ _g_u_i_l_d_s. In the domestic system _m_e_r_c_h_a_n_t_s
took materials to homes where artisans performed the necessary work, craft
guilds on the other hand were associations of _a_r_t_i_s_a_n_s which passed work from
one shop to another, for example: leather was tanned by a _t_a_n_n_e_r, passed to
_c_u_r_r_i_e_r_s, and finally arrived at _s_h_o_e_m_a_k_e_r_s and _s_a_d_d_l_e_r_s. The beginning of the
industrial revolution is usually associated with 18th century English _t_e_x_t_i_l_e
industry, with the invention of _f_l_y_i_n_g_ _s_h_u_t_t_l_e by _J_o_h_n_ _K_a_y in 1733, the
_s_p_i_n_n_i_n_g_ _j_e_n_n_y by _J_a_m_e_s_ _H_a_r_g_r_e_a_v_e_s in 1765, the _w_a_t_e_r_ _f_r_a_m_e by _R_i_c_h_a_r_d
_A_r_k_w_r_i_g_h_t in 1769 and the _s_t_e_a_m_ _e_n_g_i_n_e by _J_a_m_e_s_ _W_a_t_t in 1765. In 1851 at the
_C_r_y_s_t_a_l_ _P_a_l_a_c_e_ _E_x_h_i_b_i_t_i_o_n the term _A_m_e_r_i_c_a_n_ _s_y_s_t_e_m_ _o_f_ _m_a_n_u_f_a_c_t_u_r_i_n_g was used to
describe the new approach that was evolving in the _U_n_i_t_e_d_ _S_t_a_t_e_s_ _o_f_ _A_m_e_r_i_c_a
which centered on two central features: _i_n_t_e_r_c_h_a_n_g_e_a_b_l_e_ _p_a_r_t_s and extensive use
of _m_e_c_h_a_n_i_z_a_t_i_o_n to produce them.
Henry Ford in 1919
In 1913 _H_e_n_r_y_ _F_o_r_d first used the concept of the _a_s_s_e_m_b_l_y_ _l_i_n_e in _H_i_g_h_l_a_n_d
_P_a_r_k, he characterized it as follows:
     "The thing is to keep everything in motion and take the work to the
     man and not the man to the work. That is the real principle of our
     production, and _c_o_n_v_e_y_o_r_s are only one of many means to an end"_[_3_]
This became one the central ideas that led to _m_a_s_s_ _p_r_o_d_u_c_t_i_o_n, one of the main
elements of the _S_e_c_o_n_d_ _I_n_d_u_s_t_r_i_a_l_ _R_e_v_o_l_u_t_i_o_n, along with emergence of the
_e_l_e_c_t_r_i_c_a_l_ _i_n_d_u_s_t_r_y and _p_e_t_r_o_l_e_u_m_ _i_n_d_u_s_t_r_y.

Frederick Taylor
In 1911 _F_r_e_d_e_r_i_c_k_ _T_a_y_l_o_r published his "The Principles of Scientific
Management",_[_4_] in which he characterized _s_c_i_e_n_t_i_f_i_c_ _m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t as:
   1. The development of a true _s_c_i_e_n_c_e
   2. The scientific selection of the _w_o_r_k_e_r
   3. Their scientific education and development
   4. Intimate friendly _c_o_o_p_e_r_a_t_i_o_n between management and the workers
Taylor is also credited for developing stopwatch time study, this combined with
_F_r_a_n_k and _L_i_l_l_i_a_n Gilbreth motion study gave way to _t_i_m_e_ _a_n_d_ _m_o_t_i_o_n_ _s_t_u_d_y which
is centered on the concepts of standard method and standard time. Other
contemporaries of Taylor worth remembering are _M_o_r_r_i_s_ _C_o_o_k_e (rural
electrification in 1920s) and _H_e_n_r_y_ _G_a_n_t_t (Gantt chart). Also in 1910 _H_u_g_o
_D_i_e_m_e_r published the first _i_n_d_u_s_t_r_i_a_l_ _e_n_g_i_n_e_e_r_i_n_g book: Factory Organization
and Admnistration.
In 1913 Ford W.Harris published his "How Many parts to make at once" in which
he presented the idea of the _e_c_o_n_o_m_i_c_ _o_r_d_e_r_ _q_u_a_n_t_i_t_y model. He described the
problem as follows:
     "_I_n_t_e_r_e_s_t on capital tied up in _w_a_g_e_s, material and _o_v_e_r_h_e_a_d sets a
     maximum limit to the quantity of parts which can be profitably
     manufactured at one time; "_s_e_t_u_p_-_u_p" costs on the job fix the
     minimum. Experience has shown one manager a way to determine the
     economical size of lots"_[_5_]
In 1931 _W_a_l_t_e_r_ _S_h_e_w_h_a_r_t published his Economic Control of Quality of
Manufactured Product, the first systematic treatment _[_6_] of the subject of
_S_t_a_t_i_s_t_i_c_a_l_ _P_r_o_c_e_s_s_ _C_o_n_t_r_o_l.
In 1943, in Japan, _T_a_i_i_c_h_i_ _O_h_n_o arrived at _T_o_y_o_t_a_ _M_o_t_o_r company. Toyota evolved
a unique manufacturing system centered on two complementary notions: _j_u_s_t_ _i_n
_t_i_m_e and _a_u_t_o_n_o_m_a_t_i_o_n. In 1983 J.N Edwards published his "MRP and Kanban-
American style" in which he described JIT goals in terms of seven zeros:_[_7_]
zero defects, zero (excess) lot size, zero setups, zero breakdowns, zero
handling, zero lead time and zero surging. This periods also marks the spread
of _T_o_t_a_l_ _Q_u_a_l_i_t_y_ _M_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t in Japan, ideas initially developed by American
authors such as _D_e_m_i_n_g, _J_u_r_a_n and _A_r_m_a_n_d_ _V_._ _F_e_i_g_e_n_b_a_u_m. Schnonberger_[_8_]
identified seven fundamentals principles essential to the Japanese approach:
   1. Process control
   2. Easy-to-see quality
   3. Insistence on compliance
   4. Line stop
   5. Correcting one's own errors
   6. The 100% check
   7. Continual improvement
In 1987 the International Organization for Standardization (_I_S_O), recognizing
the growing importance of quality, issued the _I_S_O_ _9_0_0_0, a family of standards
related to quality management systems.
Meanwhile in 1964, a different approach was developed by Joseph Orlicky as a
response to the TOYOTA Manufacturing Program: _M_a_t_e_r_i_a_l_ _R_e_q_u_i_r_e_m_e_n_t_s_ _P_l_a_n_n_i_n_g
(MRP) at _I_B_M, latter gaining momentum in 1972 when the American Production and
Inventory Control Society launched the "MRP Crusade". One of the key insights
of this management system was the distinction between _d_e_p_e_n_d_e_n_t_ _d_e_m_a_n_d and
_i_n_d_e_p_e_n_d_e_n_t_ _d_e_m_a_n_d.
Recent trends in the field revolve around concepts such as _B_u_s_i_n_e_s_s_ _P_r_o_c_e_s_s_ _R_e_-

In a job shop machines are grouped by technological similarities regarding
transformation processes, therefore a single shop can work very different
products (in this picture four colors). Also notice that in this drawing each
shop contains a single machine.
Flexible Manufacturing System: in the middle there are two rails for the
shuttle to move _p_a_l_l_e_t_s between machining centers (there are also FMS which use
_A_G_V_s), in front of each machining center there is a buffer and in left we have
a shelf for storing pallets. Usually in the back there is a similar system for
managing the set of _t_o_o_l_s required for different _m_a_c_h_i_n_i_n_g operations.
A first possible distinction in pprroodduuccttiioonn ssyysstteemmss (technological
classification) is between process production and part production. Process
production means that the product undergoes physical -chemical transformations
and lacks assembly operations, therefore raw materials cant easily be obtained
from the final product, examples include: _p_a_p_e_r, _c_e_m_e_n_t and _n_y_l_o_n. Part
production (ex:cars and ovens) comprises both _m_a_n_u_f_a_c_t_u_r_i_n_g systems and
_a_s_s_e_m_b_l_y systems. In the first category we find _j_o_b_ _s_h_o_p_s, _m_a_n_u_f_a_c_t_u_r_i_n_g_ _c_e_l_l_s,

have _f_i_x_e_d_ _p_o_s_i_t_i_o_n systems, _a_s_s_e_m_b_l_y_ _l_i_n_e_s and _a_s_s_e_m_b_l_y_ _s_h_o_p_s (both manual

based on _L_e_a_d_ _T_i_m_e (manufacturing lead time vs delivery lead time): _E_n_g_i_n_e_e_r_ _t_o

According to this classification different kinds of systems will have different
customer order decoupling points (CODP), meaning that _W_o_r_k_ _i_n_ _P_r_o_g_r_e_s_s cycle
stock levels are practically nonexistent regarding operations located after the
CODP (except for WIP due to queues).
The concept of production systems can be expanded to the _s_e_r_v_i_c_e_ _s_e_c_t_o_r world
keeping in mind that services have some fundamental differences in respect to
material goods: intangibility, client always present during transformation
processes, no stocks for "finished goods". Services can be classified according
to a service process matrix:_[_1_2_] degree of labor intensity (volume) vs degree
of customization (variety). For high degree of labor intensity we have Mass
Services (ex: _c_o_m_m_e_r_c_i_a_l_ _b_a_n_k_i_n_g bill payments and _s_t_a_t_e_ _s_c_h_o_o_l_s) and
Professional Services (ex:personal _p_h_y_s_i_c_i_a_n_s and _l_a_w_y_e_r_s), while for low
degree of labor intensity we have Service Factories (ex:_a_i_r_l_i_n_e_s and _h_o_t_e_l_s)
and Service Shops (ex:_h_o_s_p_i_t_a_l_s and _a_u_t_o_ _m_e_c_h_a_n_i_c_s).
The systems described above are _i_d_e_a_l_ _t_y_p_e_s, real systems may present
themselves as hybrids of those categories.

OOppeerraattiioonnss ssttrraatteeggyy concerns policies and plans of use of the firm productive
resources with the aim of supporting long term competitive strategy. Metrics in
operations management can be broadly classified into _e_f_f_i_c_i_e_n_c_y metrics and
_e_f_f_e_c_t_i_v_e_n_e_s_s metrics. Effectiveness metrics involve:
   1. _P_r_i_c_e (actually fixed by marketing, but lower bounded by production
      cost): purchase price, use costs, maintenance costs, upgrade costs,
      disposal costs
   2. _Q_u_a_l_i_t_y: specification and compliance
   3. _T_i_m_e: productive lead time, information lead time, punctuality

   5. Stock _a_v_a_i_l_a_b_i_l_i_t_y
A more recent approach, introduced by Terry Hill,_[_1_3_] involves distinguishing
competitive variables in order winner and order qualifiers when defining
operations strategy. Order winners are variables which permit differentiating
the company from competitors, while order qualifiers are prerequisites for
engaging in a transaction. This view can be seen as a unifying approach between
operations management and _m_a_r_k_e_t_i_n_g (see _s_e_g_m_e_n_t_a_t_i_o_n and _p_o_s_i_t_i_o_n_i_n_g).
_PP_rr_oo_dd_uu_cc_tt_ii_vv_ii_tt_yy is a standard efficiency metric for evaluation of production
systems, broadly speaking a ratio between outputs and inputs, and can assume
many specific forms, for example: machine productivity, workforce productivity,
raw material productivity, warehouse productivity (=_i_n_v_e_n_t_o_r_y_ _t_u_r_n_o_v_e_r). It is
also useful to break up productivity in use U (productive percentage of total
time) and yield Î· (ratio between produced volume and productive time) to
better evaluate production systems performances. Cycle times can be modeled
through _m_a_n_u_f_a_c_t_u_r_i_n_g engineering if the individual operations are heavily
automated, if the manual component is the prevalent one, methods used include:

_A_B_C_ _a_n_a_l_y_s_i_s is a method for analyzing inventory based on _P_a_r_e_t_o_ _d_i_s_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_o_n,
it posits that since revenue from items on inventory will be _p_o_w_e_r_ _l_a_w
distributed then it makes sense to manage items differently based on their
position on a revenue-inventory level matrix, 3 classes are constructed (A,B
and C) from cumulative item revenues, so in a matrix each item will have a
letter (A,B or C) assigned for revenue and inventory. This method posits that
items away from the diagonal should be managed differently: items in the upper
part are subject to risk of obsolescence, items in the lower part are subject
to risk of _s_t_o_c_k_o_u_t.
_TT_hh_rr_oo_uu_gg_hh_pp_uu_tt is a variable which quantifies the number of parts produced in the
unit of time. Although estimating throughput for a single process maybe fairly
simple, doing so for an entire production system involves an additional
difficulty due to the presence of queues which can come from: machine
_b_r_e_a_k_d_o_w_n_s, processing time variability, scraps, setups, _m_a_i_n_t_e_n_a_n_c_e time, lack
of orders, lack of materials, _s_t_r_i_k_e_s, bad coordination between resources, mix
variability, plus all these inefficiencies tend to compound depending on the
nature of the production system. One important example of how system throughput
is tied to system design are _b_o_t_t_l_e_n_e_c_k_s: in job shops bottlenecks are
typically dynamic and dependent on scheduling while on transfer lines it makes
sense to speak of "the bottleneck" since it can be univocally associated with a
specific station on the line. This leads to the problem of how to define
_c_a_p_a_c_i_t_y measures, that is an estimation of the maximum output of a given
production system, and _c_a_p_a_c_i_t_y_ _u_t_i_l_i_z_a_t_i_o_n.

approach of _J_u_s_t_ _i_n_ _T_i_m_e. Regarding the traditional pull approach a number of
techniques have been developed based on the work of Ford W. Harris_[_5_] (1913)
which came to be know as the _EE_cc_oo_nn_oo_mm_ii_cc_ _OO_rr_dd_ee_rr_ _QQ_uu_aa_nn_tt_ii_tt_yy_ _MM_oo_dd_ee_ll, which formed the

Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP II)

IBM, essentially a _p_u_s_h approach to inventory control and production planning,
which takes as input both the _M_a_s_t_e_r_ _P_r_o_d_u_c_t_i_o_n_ _S_c_h_e_d_u_l_e (MPS) and the _B_i_l_l_ _o_f
_M_a_t_e_r_i_a_l_s (BOM) and gives as output a schedule for the _m_a_t_e_r_i_a_l_s needed in the
production process. The MPS can be seen as a kind of aggregate planning for
production coming in two fundamentally opposing varieties: plans which try to
chase demand and level plans which try to keep uniform capacity utilization.
Many models have been proposed to solve MPS problems: analytical models (e.g.
Magee Boodman model), exact optimization algorithmic models (e.g. _L_P and _I_L_P
and _h_e_u_r_i_s_t_i_c models (e.g. Aucamp model). MRP can be briefly described as a 3s
procedure: sum (different orders), split (in lots), shift (in time according to
item lead time) To avoid an "explosion" of data processing in MRP (number of
BOMs required in input) _p_l_a_n_n_i_n_g_ _b_i_l_l_s (such as family bills or super bills)
can be useful since they allow a rationalization of input data into common
codes. MRP had some notorious problems such as infinite _c_a_p_a_c_i_t_y and fixed _l_e_a_d
_t_i_m_e_s, giving way later on to modifications of original software implementation
in the form of _M_R_P_ _I_I and _E_R_P. In this context problems of _s_c_h_e_d_u_l_i_n_g_

in _P_D_C_A style). A series of tools have been developed mainly with the objective
of replicating Toyota success: a very common implementation involves small
cards known as _k_a_n_b_a_n_s, these also come in some varieties: reorder kanbans,
allarm kanbans, triangle kanbans, etc.). Seen more broadly JIT can include

Operations management _t_e_x_t_b_o_o_k_s usually cover _dd_ee_mm_aa_nn_dd_ _ff_oo_rr_ee_cc_aa_ss_tt_ii_nn_gg, even though
it is not strictly speaking an operations problem, because demand is related to
some production systems variables. For example, a classic approach in
dimensioning _s_a_f_e_t_y_ _s_t_o_c_k_s requires calculating _s_t_a_n_d_a_r_d_ _d_e_v_i_a_t_i_o_n of _f_o_r_e_c_a_s_t
_e_r_r_o_r_s. Demand forecasting is also a critical part of push systems, since order
releases have to be planned ahead of actual clients orders. Also any serious
discussion of _c_a_p_a_c_i_t_y_ _p_l_a_n_n_i_n_g involves adjusting company outputs with market
demands.
