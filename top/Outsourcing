In business, oouuttssoouurrcciinngg is the _c_o_n_t_r_a_c_t_i_n_g out of a business process to a
third-party. The term "outsourcing" became popular in the _U_n_i_t_e_d_ _S_t_a_t_e_s near
the turn of the 21st century. Outsourcing sometimes involves transferring
employees and assets from one firm to another, but not always._[_1_]
Outsourcing includes both foreign and domestic contracting,_[_2_] and sometimes
includes _o_f_f_s_h_o_r_i_n_g or relocating a business function to another country._[_3_]
Financial savings from lower international labor rates is a big motivation for
outsourcing/offshoring.
The opposite of outsourcing is called _i_n_s_o_u_r_c_i_n_g, which entails bringing
processes handled by third-party firms in-house, and is sometimes accomplished
via _v_e_r_t_i_c_a_l_ _i_n_t_e_g_r_a_t_i_o_n. However, a business can provide a contract service to
another business without necessarily insourcing that business process.

In the early 21st century, businesses increasingly outsourced to suppliers
outside their own country, sometimes referred to as offshoring or _o_f_f_s_h_o_r_e
_o_u_t_s_o_u_r_c_i_n_g. Several related terms have emerged to refer to various aspects of
the complex relationship between economic _o_r_g_a_n_i_z_a_t_i_o_n_s or _n_e_t_w_o_r_k_s, such as

Outsourcing can offer greater budget flexibility and control. Outsourcing lets
organizations pay for only the services they need, when they need them. It also
reduces the need to hire and train specialized staff, brings in fresh
engineering expertise, and reduces capital and operating expenses._[_8_]
One of the biggest changes in the early 21st century came from the growth of
groups of people using online technologies to use outsourcing as a way to build
a viable service delivery business that can be run from virtually anywhere in
the world. The preferential contract rates that can be obtained by temporarily
employing experts in specific areas to deliver elements of a project purely
online means that there is a growing number of small businesses that operate
entirely online using offshore contractors to deliver the work before
repackaging it to deliver to the end user. One common area where this business
model thrives is in providing website creation, analysis and marketing
services. All elements can be done remotely and delivered digitally, and
service providers can leverage the scale and economy of outsourcing to deliver
high-value services at reduced end-customer prices.

Companies outsource to avoid certain types of costs. They outsource the non
core activities. Among the reasons companies elect to outsource include the
avoidance of regulations, high taxes, high energy costs, and costs associated
with defined benefits in labor-union contracts and taxes for government-
mandated benefits. Perceived or actual gross margin in the short run
incentivizes a company to outsource. With reduced short-run costs, executive
management sees the opportunity for short-run profits, while the income growth
of the consumer base is strained._[_2_] This motivates companies to outsource for
lower labor costs. However, the company may or may not incur unexpected costs
to train these overseas workers._[_9_] Lower regulatory costs are an addition to
companies saving money when outsourcing. On comparative costs, a U.S. employer
typically incurs higher defined benefit costs associated with taxes to account

managerial costs.
Companies may seek internal savings to focus money and resources towards core
business. A company may outsource its landscaping functions irrelevant to the
core business._[_1_3_] Companies and public entities may outsource certain
specialized functions, such as payroll, to _A_D_P or _C_e_r_i_d_i_a_n. Companies may find

Import marketers may make short-run profits from cheaper overseas labor and
currency mainly in wealth-consuming sectors at the long-run expense of an
economy's wealth-producing sectors, thus straining the home country's tax base,
income growth, and increasing the debt burden. When companies offshore products
and services, those jobs may leave the home country for foreign countries, at
the expense of the wealth-producing sectors._[_2_] Outsourcing may increase the
risk of leakage and reduce confidentiality, as well as introduce additional

Before outsourcing, an organization is responsible for the actions of their
entire staff, sometimes a substantial liability. When these same people are
transferred to an outsourcer, they may not even change desks. But their legal
status changes. They are no longer directly employed by (and responsible to)
the organization. This creates legal, security and compliance issues that are
often addressed through the contract between the client and the suppliers. This
is one of the most complex areas of outsourcing and sometimes involves a
specialist third-party adviser.
Fraud is a specific security issue as well as criminal activity, whether it is
by employees or the supplier staff. However, it can be disputed that fraud is
more likely when outsourcers are involved, for example credit-card theft when
there is the opportunity for fraud by credit-card cloning. In April 2005, a
high-profile case involving the theft of $350,000 from four _C_i_t_i_b_a_n_k customers
occurred when call-center workers acquired the passwords to customer accounts
and transferred the money to their own accounts opened under fictitious names.

Companies looking to outsource their engineering activities should evaluate the
capabilities of the providers. There are many benchmarking reports by
independent research and consulting firms which analyze the vendors'
capabilities.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]

The early trend in outsourcing was seen in financial constructs where a
function's associated capital and personnel were sold to a vendor and then
rented back over a series of years. Early benefits were a boost in expertise
and efficiency as outsource vendors had more focus and capability in their
specialization. As time progressed, the year 0 benefit was off the books,
customer needs evolved and contracts generally aged poorly. Rigid contracts
hampered the ability of customers to respond to emerging business drivers, and
simultaneously tied the hands of the vendor's team who was focused on increased
efficiencies for static problems. The result tended to be additional "project"
contracts for incremental changes in a monopoly environment. Many deals became
contentious, and many customers have become very uncomfortable surrendering so
much power to a single vendor. As the contract aged, it became increasingly
difficult to even negotiate with vendors with confidence, because the customer
began to lack any real knowledge of the cost structure of the function, or the
competitive situation of the vendor.
Industry leaders turned to each other, trade journals and management
consultants to try to regain control of the situation, and the next answer that
grabbed hold of the industry was labor cost arbitration; leveraging cheap,
offshore resources to replace or pressure increasingly expensive legacy
outsource vendors. Pressure led incumbent vendors to move resources offshore,
or to be replaced wholesale. As this renegotiation was under way, many
customers seized the opportunity to restructure to gain more control,
transparency and negotiating power. The end result has been fragmentation of
outsource contracts and a decline in mega-deals. Many companies are now relying
on several vendors who each offer specialization and / or lowest cost.

Outsourcing has gone through many iterations and reinventions. Some outsourcing
deals have been partially or fully reversed, citing an inability to execute
strategy, lost transparency & control, onerous contractual models, a lack of
competition, recurring costs, hidden costs, and so on. Many companies are now
moving to more tailored models where along with outsource vendor
diversification, key parts of what was previously outsourced has been
insourced. Insourcing has been identified as a means to ensure control,
compliance and to gain competitive differentiation through vertical integration
or the development of shared services [commonly called a 'center of
excellence']. Insourcing at some level also tends to be leveraged to enable
organizations to undergo significant transformational change.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]
Further, the label outsourcing has been found to be used for too many different
kinds of exchange in confusing ways. For example, global software development,
which often involves people working in different countries, cannot simply be
called outsourcing. The outsourcing-based market model fails to explain why
these development projects are jointly developed, and not simply bought and
sold in the marketplace. Recently, a study has identified an additional system
of governance, termed algocracy, that appears to govern global software
projects alongside bureaucratic and market-based mechanisms. The study_[_2_4_]
distinguishes code-based governance system from bureaucracy and the market, and
underscores the prominent features of each organizational form in terms of its
ruling mechanism: bureaucracy (legal-rational), the market (price), and
algocracy (programming or algorithm). So, global software development projects,
though not insourced, are not outsourced either. They are in-between, in a
process that is sometimes termed _R_e_m_o_t_e_ _I_n_-_S_o_u_r_c_i_n_g. Projects are developed
together where a common software platform allows different teams around the
world to work on the same project together.

Economic growth requires change, therefore a governance disposed to helping
social and economic structures adapt to the changing environment will
facilitate growth and a stable transition to new economic structures.,_[_2_7_]
until the economic structures become detrimental to the social, political and
cultural structures. In less economically developed countries, policies which
embrace the global phenomenon of outsourcing are a logical response to the
ongoing movement towards "open markets" and "trade liberalization."
Outsourcing, when interpreted as a trade phenomenon, complements trade
liberalization strategies not only by promoting technological spillovers and
capital inflows but also by offsetting the increasing levels of unemployment
which result from opening up domestic markets. As prices adjust to those in the
global market they no longer reflect domestic productivity, driving lower-
productivity firms in the previously protected sectors out of business.
Economic theorists argue that the resulting unemployment is only temporary as
workers readjust and are eventually incorporated into the country‚Äôs most
productive sectors, namely those which enjoy a competitive edge over other
players in the international market. Nonetheless, rapid liberalization of
markets in developing nations has not maximized the productivity potential of
the region. In the Global South, where technological development is drastically
lower than in the North, the redeployment of human and capital resources into
new export markets has not come at the cost of necessarily low-productivity
sectors but rather underdeveloped ones. In other words, many of the previously
protected sectors were not competitive yet on a global scale, not because they
naturally lacked the comparative advantage, but because industry efficiency had
not yet been reached._[_2_8_] In such cases where liberalization stunts the growth
of potential industries, unemployment is a reflection of many underemployed
resources. Outsourcing fills in the gap of receding protected national
industries, improving employment and living standards. Among other economic
externalities, outsourcing promotes capital inflows and infrastructure. In
Mexico, wage convergence was faster in cities where outsourcing first took hold
through maquiladoras, along the US-Mexican border. Studies suggest that for
every 10% increase in US wages, northern cities in Mexico which are most
influenced by outsourcing would experience wage rises of 2.5%, about 0.69%
higher than in inner cities._[_2_9_] Corruption and reduced tax revenues after
signing the _N_A_F_T_A_ _T_r_e_a_t_y have limited the economic resources available to the
Mexican government, thus explaining the difference in investment policies
between Mexico and China._[_2_8_] Conversely, one of the successes of Asian
countries in the twentieth century has been their promotion of higher rates of
saving and investment. Studies suggest that the increase in capital input
fueled the ‚ÄòAsian miracle‚Äô rather than improvements in productivity and
industrial efficiency. Though the previous conclusion suggests production
conditions in the region remained static, the situation in East Asia
experienced rapid transformations. Not only were national educational rates
raised drastically, but there was also an increase in patenting and research
and development expenditures. Rising levels of education, urbanization and even
of patenting illustrate the active role of the government in advancing
education as well as encouraging research and development._[_3_0_]

Jobs become outsourced not based on the skill-level group it represents, but
rather based on a variety of other factors including transportation cost of
ideas, wage and labour productivity edge._[_2_7_] Because of the overall
uncertainty regarding the future dynamics of outsourcing it is not possible to
predict the nature of labour demand in different regions. To better prepare the
domestic workforce to future industry demands, therefore, national education
programs ought to focus on flexibility and diversity of skills rather than on
any specific task-oriented skills. Emphasis should go on preparing students
both to succeed in non-habitual tasks and to adapt to changes in labour demands
in the market._[_3_1_] A specific goal that ought to be adopted is teaching
students how to learn rather than teach them particular skills. This strategy
would help students adapt to changing skill requirements in the future thus
reducing friction from structural unemployment._[_2_7_]

The uncertainty regarding the domestic productivity edge renders caution a key
element of governance to ensure a sustainable regional development. Together
with helping the unemployed re-enter the work force and smoothly transition
into high-demand labour opportunities ‚Äì potentially through re-training
programs ‚Äì, the government should also address the socioeconomic struggle and
other welfare concerns of displaced employees._[_3_2_] Negative welfare effects of
outsourcing have gathered substantial public attention. The possibility of
outsourcing has internationalized labour markets which used to be local,
opening up jobs which were traditionally non-traded to international
competition. The resulting combination of lower wages and unemployment for
certain jobs has driven the perceived ‚Äòlosers‚Äô to engage in heated
political debate. Labour unions in the European Union have succeeded in pushing
through protectionist policies in favour or lower-skilled groups throughout the
1970s and 1980s, including the Common Agricultural Policy on farming._[_2_7_]
Interest groups opposing outsourcing have been more active to voice their
disapproval because the negative outcomes of the phenomenon are more
concentrated on specific groups of people, namely those losing jobs to external
competition, whereas the benefits from it become dissipated among the
population at large. Overall lower prices and greater quality and variety of
goods in domestic markets are some of the benefits of exploiting a country‚Äôs
comparative advantage through outsourcing. Unlike the alleged ‚Äòlosers‚Äô from
outsourcing, those affected positively by it lack the motivation to organize to
voice their support. There has been a wave of protectionism concerned with deep
changes in the social structure allegedly imposed on the global system through
globalization and outsourcing. The activists see a readjustment of class
systems and highlight an increased fracture in societies between the
‚Äòhaves‚Äô and the ‚Äòhave-nots‚Äô as different groups adjust to increasingly
or decreasingly advantageous positions in the system of outsourcing. Opponents
of outsourcing have also denounced it as a threat to local cultural integrity.
The argument on cultural disintegration points to the standardization of
practices and norms as multinational corporations become involved with
industries in regions culturally different from those in the country of origin.
The alleged diffusion of culture has raised concern over the endurance of
cultural norms and values, sociopolitical institutions and frameworks, or even
cultural preferences and traditions in a context of increasing foreign
presence._[_3_3_] Increased uncertainty regarding future socioeconomic security
ought to be met with policies promoting equality and a fair redistribution of
economic gains for a government to maintain its voters‚Äô favour. Because of
overall unpredictability, governments will likely need to reassure civilians
that the burden of employment jobs resulting from outsourcing will be shared
among taxpayers._[_2_7_] The fluctuations in employment levels are determined by
the types of jobs which can be profitably outsourced or offshored. Domestic
jobs become offshored or outsourced when lower productivity in other regions is
compensated by lower wages, making outsourcing profitable even despite the
added costs of transportation. The overall cost-effectiveness of the spatial
unbundling of the industrial process thus depends on the cost of transporting
specific services or ideas given the available technology. Because of this
reason technological advancements such as the telecommunications revolution,
air shipping or the Internet have deeply accelerated outsourcing and may
continue to boost this process. The future results of technological ingenuity
and innovation are unknown, as are its potential impacts employment levels on
any given task or job across regions._[_2_7_] In the Global South, policies
attracting multinational corporations can help increase employment levels and
promote growth. Governments which pursue such strategies facilitate welfare
protection given the context of increased unemployment in industries which
cannot compete with the international market due to trade liberalization
policies._[_2_8_]

Outsourcing results from an internationalization of labour markets as more
tasks become tradable. According to leading economist Greg Mankiw, the labour
market functions under the same forces as the market of goods, with the
underlying implication that the greater the number of tasks available to being
moved, the better for efficiency under the gains from trade. With technological
progress, more tasks can be offshored at different stages of the overall
corporate process._[_3_4_]

There are widespread claims that outsourcing has pushed environmental standards
down in developing regions as countries compete to attract foreign projects and
investment. Similar to lower wages, lower health and environmental regulations
contribute to giving a country a comparative advantage over another due to
lower production costs. The controversy this raises, however, is that unlike
wages, lower health or environmental standards does benefit the new employees
joining the workforce. Import competition has caused a de facto ‚Äòrace-to-the-
bottom‚Äô where countries lower environmental regulations to secure a
competitive edge for their industries relative to other countries. As Mexico
competes with China over Canadian and American markets, its national Commission
for Environmental Cooperation has not been active in enacting or enforcing
regulations to prevent environmental damage from increasingly industrialized
Export Processing Zones. Similarly, since the signing of NAFTA heavy industries
have increasingly moved to the US which has a comparative advantage due to its
abundant presence capital and well-developed technology. A further example of
environmental de-regulation with the objective of protecting trade incentives
have been the numerous exemptions to carbon taxes in European countries during
the 1990s. The evidence suggests that even if outsourcing has promoted lower
environmental protection, there are no intrinsic geographic implications that
the Global South has been more negatively affected than the North. o Although
outsourcing can influence environmental de-regulatory trends, the added cost of
preventing pollution does not majorly determine trade flows or
industrialization._[_3_5_]

Outsourcing has contributed to further levelling of global inequalities as it
has led to general trends of industrialization in the Global South and
deindustrialization in the Global North.
Even though outsourcing has promoted a movement of industrial sites from the
Global North to Global South regions, it has not been the only reason for the
concurrent deindustrialization and industrialization of the North and South
respectively. Deindustrialization in more economically and technologically
developed regions has also been affected by increased industrial productivity.
_[_3_6_]
The rise in industrial efficiency which characterized development in developed
countries has occurred as a result of labour-saving technological improvements.
Although these improvements do not directly reduce employment levels but rather
increase output per unit of work, they can indirectly diminish the amount of
labour required for fixed levels of output._[_3_7_] Likewise, a trending shift in
demand towards non-tradable services such as those in the health-care or
government sectors has further accelerated deindustrialization in the Global
North. Since these tasks cannot be outsourced, the demand for them needs to be
met domestically abiding by the local market price. Consequently, a shift in
the labour force towards fulfilling these profitable services has mostly taken
place at the expense of industry since the agricultural sector in the early
industrializing Global North had already been maximizing its labour capacity.
_[_3_6_]
Despite the variety of domestic and international factors affecting
deindustrialization in the Global North, those concerning the external
influence of the global market have been the most influential ones since 1994.
_[_3_8_]
The recent industrialization process outsourcing has encouraged in the Global
South has taken place at a much faster pace than it did during its beginnings
in the North, given that the well-developed technology was already developed,
and merely spread to further regions._[_3_6_]

The almost simultaneous industrialization of the developing Global South and
deindustrialization of the more developed Global North resulted in an
international convergence of incomes.
Outsourcing has been characterized by rapid rates of growth and
industrialization in the Global South. Conversely, the Global North has
experienced a moderate slowdown in growth. Patterns of global industrialization
and deindustrialization are explained by a combination of models in economic
geography and economic growth. Models in economic geography illustrate that
decreasing communication costs reduce the spatial clustering of industrial
development. The lower cost to the spread of ideas improved coordination and
communication within corporations across greater geographic distances. This
process originated roughly after the international chaos of the World Wars, as
a consequence of advancements in information technology during the 1960s.
Further adaptations to technological progress, particularly the spread of the
internet and liberalization of the telecommunications industry, permitted an
acceleration of the movement of ideas and consequently of outsourcing since
about the 1980s._[_3_6_]

The level of migration has remained relatively low, particularly compared to
the mass migratory trends which characterized the Industrial Revolution roughly
between 1850 and 1914.,_[_3_6_] probably because labor markets are not free now.
Countries now have discrimination labor laws, only allow people with

"Outsourcing" became a popular political issue in the United States, having
been conflated with offshoring, during the _2_0_0_4_ _U_._S_._ _p_r_e_s_i_d_e_n_t_i_a_l_ _e_l_e_c_t_i_o_n. The
political debate centered on outsourcing's consequences for the domestic U.S.
workforce. _D_e_m_o_c_r_a_t_i_c U.S. presidential candidate _J_o_h_n_ _K_e_r_r_y criticized U.S.
firms that outsource jobs abroad or that incorporate overseas in _t_a_x_ _h_a_v_e_n_s to
avoid paying their "fair share" of _U_._S_._ _t_a_x_e_s during his 2004 campaign, calling
such firms "_B_e_n_e_d_i_c_t_ _A_r_n_o_l_d corporations"._[_4_1_]
Criticism of outsourcing, from the perspective of _U_._S_._ _c_i_t_i_z_e_n_s, generally
revolves around the costs associated with transferring control of the labor
process to an external entity in another country. A _Z_o_g_b_y_ _I_n_t_e_r_n_a_t_i_o_n_a_l poll
conducted in August 2004 found that 71% of American voters believed that
‚Äúoutsourcing jobs overseas‚Äù hurt the economy while another 62% believed
that the U.S. government should impose some legislative action against
companies that transfer domestic jobs overseas, possibly in the form of
increased taxes on companies that outsource._[_4_2_] One prediction (from 2010)
claims that, by 2014, more than 1.3 million positions will disappear because of
"the accelerated movement of work to India ..." and some other countries
willing to accept outsourced jobs._[_4_3_] President Obama promoted an act titled
'_B_r_i_n_g_ _J_o_b_s_ _H_o_m_e_ _A_c_t' that would help reshore jobs by giving incentives such as
a tax cut or a 20 percent tax credit for moving operations back to the USA._[_4_4_]
_U_n_i_o_n_ _b_u_s_t_i_n_g is one possible cause of outsourcing. As unions are disadvantaged
by union busting legislation, workers lose bargaining power and it becomes
easier for corporations to fire them and ship their job overseas._[_4_5_]
Another given[_b_y_ _w_h_o_m_?] rationale is the high corporate income tax rate in the
U.S. relative to other OECD nations,_[_4_6_]_[_4_7_]_[_4_8_] and the practice of taxing
revenues earned outside of U.S. jurisdiction, a very uncommon practice.
However, outsourcing is not solely a U.S. phenomenon as corporations in various
nations with low tax rates outsource as well, which means that high taxation
can only partially, if at all, explain US outsourcing. For example, the amount
of corporate outsourcing in 1950 would be considerably lower than today, yet
the tax rate was actually higher in 1950._[_4_9_]
It is argued[_b_y_ _w_h_o_m_?] that lowering the corporate income tax and ending the
double-taxation of foreign-derived revenue (taxed once in the nation where the
revenue was raised, and once from the U.S.) will alleviate corporate
outsourcing and make the U.S. more attractive to foreign companies. However,
while the US has a high official tax rate, the actual taxes paid by US
corporations may be considerably lower due to the use of tax loopholes, tax
havens, and "gaming the system"._[_5_0_] Rather than avoiding taxes, outsourcing
may be mostly driven by the desire to lower labor costs (see standpoint of

Where outsourcing involves the transfer of an undertaking, it is subject to
Council Directive 77/187 of 14 February 1977, on the approximation of the laws
of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees‚Äô rights in the
event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of businesses (as
amended by Directive 98/50/EC of 29 June 1998; consolidated in Directive 2001/
23 of 12 March 2001)._[_5_1_] Under that directive, rights acquired by employees
with the former employer are to be safeguarded when they, together with the
undertaking in which they are employed, are transferred to another employer,
i.e. the contractor. An example of a case involving such contracting-out was
the decision of the European Court of Justice in Christel Schmidt v. Spar- und
Leihkasse der fr√ºheren √Ñmter Bordesholm, Kiel und Cronshagen, Case C-392/92
[1994]. Although subsequent decisions have disputed whether a particular
contracting-out exercise constituted a transfer of an undertaking (see, for
example, Ayse S√ºzen v. Zehnacker Geb√§udereinigung GmbH Krankenhausservice,
Case C-13/95 [1997]), in principle, employees of an enterprise outsourcing part
of its activities in which they are employed may benefit from the protection
offered by the directive.
Seeking to implement the cost-cutting solutions, many Western European firms
have been transferring tech projects eastward. For example, Deutsche Bank has
some of its software developed in Ukraine, Siemens possess R&D center in
Romania. Europe Outsourcing has produced outstanding results and henceforward
they are increasing them in numbers.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]
Despite unfavorable economic conditions from 2007 to 2009, the outsourcing
services market continued to flourish in Central and Eastern European. In 2008
when the inflow of investment in Western Europe was down by 48%, it fell by
only 9% in Central and Eastern Europe. In _P_o_l_a_n_d alone, during 2009, the year

be a service performed in concert with a _c_l_i_e_n_t's existing internal _a_u_d_i_t
department. The scope of work may focus on one or more aspects of the _i_n_t_e_r_n_a_l
_a_u_d_i_t function. Co-sourcing can serve to minimize sourcing risks, increase
transparency, clarity and lend toward better control over the processes
outsourced.[_c_i_t_a_t_i_o_n_ _n_e_e_d_e_d]
Examples of co-sourcing services are supplementing the in-house internal audit
staff with specialised skills such as information _r_i_s_k_ _m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t or integrity
services, providing routine assistance to in-house auditing for operations and

the external service provider typically have a shared responsibility for
building, hosting and operating the identity service. The balance of this
responsibility can vary depending on the service levels required, and span from
an all on-premise deployment, where the identity service is built, hosted and
operated within the organization‚Äôs IT infrastructure and managed on-premise
by the external service provider. This contrasts with an "all in-the-cloud"

There has been a recent overturn of the tendency to outsource. The most recent
trends in outsourcing and offshoring have been precisely the opposite force as
companies are drifting back to perform tasks themselves and develop facilities
back in their home Western locations.
Many firms are undoing their steps in outsourcing because the consequences were
not entirely as expected. The circumstances which allow firms to unbundle the
different tasks or stages of its manufacturing process into different locations
have not been fully determined. Though the nature of the tasks plays a role
determining their interconnectedness, other factors such as innovation in the
manufacturing process or advances in transport and communication technology
also affect the need for direct contact among employees. As the process which
ties tasks together within firms remains unclear, there is a degree of
uncertainty about which tasks need to remain geographically clustered together.
In many cases firms took risks experimenting with outsourcing while lacking a
firm understanding of the relationship among internal tasks and its spatial
implications._[_3_6_]
Despite saving money, companies have often faced unexpected drawbacks from
outsourcing, such as miscommunication or lower quality of intermediate
products, which end up delaying the overall production process. According to a
Deloitte Consulting survey carried out in 2005, a quarter of the companies
which had outsourced tasks had to reverse their strategy. Many big companies
like Lenovo are increasingly considering turning around strategies of
outsourcing._[_5_4_]
Another reason for a decrease in outsourcing is that many jobs that were
subcontracted abroad have been replaced by technological advances._[_5_5_]
Public opinion in the US and other Western powers opposing outsourcing was
particularly strengthened by the drastic increase in unemployment as a result
of the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In the first decade from 2000 to 2010, the
US experienced a net loss of 687,000 jobs due to outsourcing, primarily in the
computers and electronics sector. Public disenchantment with outsourcing has
not only stirred political responses, as seen in the 2012 US Presidential
campaigns, but it has also made companies more reluctant to outsource or
offshore jobs._[_5_6_]
