      In the software industry, program management is an aspect of _s_o_f_t_w_a_r_e

PPrrooggrraamm mmaannaaggeemmeenntt or pprrooggrraammmmee mmaannaaggeemmeenntt is the process of managing several
related _p_r_o_j_e_c_t_s, often with the intention of improving an organization's
performance. In practice and in its aims it is often closely related to _s_y_s_t_e_m_s
_e_n_g_i_n_e_e_r_i_n_g and _i_n_d_u_s_t_r_i_a_l_ _e_n_g_i_n_e_e_r_i_n_g.
The Program Manager has oversight of the purpose and status of all projects in
a Program and can use this oversight to support project-level activity to
ensure the overall program goals are likely to be met, possibly by providing a
decision-making capacity that cannot be achieved at project level or by
providing the Project Manager with a program perspective when required, or as a
sounding board for ideas and approaches to solving project issues that have
program impacts. Typically in a program there is a need to identify and manage
cross-project dependencies and often the PMO (Program or _P_r_o_j_e_c_t_ _M_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t
_O_f_f_i_c_e) may not have sufficient insight of the risk, issues, requirements,
design or solution to be able to usefully manage these. The Program manager may
be well placed to provide this insight by actively seeking out such information
from the Project Managers although in large and/or complex projects, a specific
role may be required. However this insight arises, the Program Manager needs
this in order to be comfortable that the overall program goals are achievable.
There are two different views of how programmes differ from projects.
On one view, projects deliver outputs, discrete parcels or "chunks" of change;
_[_1_] programs create outcomes._[_2_] On this view, a project might deliver a new
factory, hospital or IT system. By combining these projects with other
deliverables and changes, their programs might deliver increased income from a
new product, shorter waiting lists at the hospital or reduced operating costs
due to improved technology.
The other view_[_3_] is that a program is nothing more than either a large project
or a set (or portfolio) of projects. On this second view, the point of having a
program is to exploit economies of scale and to reduce coordination costs and
risks. The project manager's job is to ensure that their project succeeds. The
program manager, on the other hand, may not care about individual projects, but
is concerned with the aggregate result or end-state. For example, in a
financial institution a program may include one project that is designed to
take advantage of a rising market, and another to protect against the downside
of a falling market. These projects are opposites with respect to their success
conditions, but they fit together in the same program.
According to the view that programs deliver outcomes but projects deliver
outputs, program management is concerned with doing the right projects. The
program manager has been described as 'playing chess' and keeping the overview
in mind, with the pieces to be used or sacrificed being the projects._[_4_] In
contrast, _p_r_o_j_e_c_t_ _m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t is about doing projects right. And also according
to this view, successful projects deliver on time, to budget and to
specification, whereas successful programs deliver long term improvements to an
organization. Improvements are usually identified through benefits. An
organization should select the group of programs that most take it towards its
strategic aims while remaining within its capacity to deliver the changes. On
the other hand, the view that programs are simply large projects or a set of
projects allows that a program may need to deliver tangible benefits quickly.
Consider the following set of projects:
    * design of the new product - this delivers a design specification,
    * modifications to the production line or factory - delivers a
      manufacturing capability,
    * marketing - delivers advertisements, brochures and pamphlets,
    * staff training - delivers staff trained to sell and support the new
      product.
One view has it that these are different projects within a program. But in
practice they can just as well be managed as sub-projects within a single
project. Which approach to choose? Program and project management are both
practical disciplines, and the answer to such a question must be "whatever
works." What works depends very much on the nature of the organization in which
the project or program is run. Typically a program is broken down into projects
that reflect the organization's structure. The design project will be run by
the design team, the factory will manage the modifications to the production
line, and so on. Organizational structure and organizational culture are key
factors in how to structure a program.
The distinction between the terms "outcome" and "output" is far from clear,
except in a trivial sense. Each of the projects listed in the example above is
designed to deliver some 'thing', known as a 'deliverable' or an 'output', and
together they improve the organization. Where one draws the line between the
complete single benefit that causes the improvement and its component parts is
partly a matter of preference and partly a matter of the culture and structure
of the organization. Either way, benefits will normally be enjoyed long after
the end of the program and all of its component projects. The point is that to
achieve maximum benefits, there must be an integration of parts into a whole.
Whether this integration is managed in something that is called a project or a
program is of secondary importance to understanding the benefits and managing
the process of integration well.
Many programs are concerned with delivering a capability to change. Only when
that capability is transferred to the _l_i_n_e_ _m_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t and utilized by the host
organization will the benefits actually be delivered. On this view, a program
team cannot, on their own, deliver benefits. Benefits can only be delivered
through the utilization of a new capability.
Programs are normally designed to deliver the organization's strategy, such as
an ambition to be the fourth biggest supermarket in a region by 2015 or reduce
wastage by 5% in two year's time.
According to Project Management Institute (PMI), The Standard for Program
Management, 2nd Ed., "A Program is a group of related projects managed in a
coordinated manner to obtain benefits and control NOT available from managing
them individually. Programs may include elements of related work outside of the
scope of the discreet projects in the program... Some projects within a program
can deliver useful incremental benefits to the organization before the program
itself has completed."
Program management also emphasizes the coordinating and prioritizing of
resources across projects, managing links between the projects and the overall
costs and risks of the program.
Program management may provide a layer above the management of projects and
focuses on selecting the best group of projects, defining them in terms of
their objectives and providing an environment where projects can be run
successfully. Program managers should not micromanage, but should leave project
management to the project managers.
In public sector work in _E_u_r_o_p_e, the term normally refers to multiple change
projects: projects that are designed to deliver benefits to the host
organization. For example, the _O_f_f_i_c_e_ _o_f_ _G_o_v_e_r_n_m_e_n_t_ _C_o_m_m_e_r_c_e for the _U_K
_g_o_v_e_r_n_m_e_n_t. An alternative to the Office of Government Commerce's methodology
for program management is that of the private sector _P_r_o_j_e_c_t_ _M_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t
_I_n_s_t_i_t_u_t_e.
Many organizations only run one program at a time, a program containing all
their projects. In _P_r_o_j_e_c_t_ _M_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t_ _I_n_s_t_i_t_u_t_e terminology, this is more
likely to be a project portfolio than a program. Some larger organizations may
have multiple programs each designed to deliver a range of improvements. Some
organizations use the concept of Systems Engineering where others use program
management.
Types of Projects according to aggregate project plan (Wheelwright & Clark -
1992): 1. Derivative Projects 2. Platform Projects 3. Breakthrough Projects 4.

  Governance
      The structure, process, and procedure to control operations and changes
      to performance objectives. Governance must include a set of metrics to
      indicate the health and progress of the program in the most vital areas.
  Alignment
      The program must support a higher level vision, goals and objectives.
  Assurance
      Verify and validate the program, ensuring adherence to standards and
      alignment with the vision.
  Management
      Ensure there are regular reviews, there is _a_c_c_o_u_n_t_a_b_i_l_i_t_y, and that
      management of projects, stakeholders and suppliers is in place.
  Integration
      Ensure that component parts fit together properly to make the intended
      whole. Optimize performance across the program _v_a_l_u_e_ _c_h_a_i_n, functionally
      and technically.
  Finances
      Track basic costs together with wider costs of administering the program.
  Infrastructure
      Allocation of resources influences the cost and success of the program.
      Infrastructure might cover offices, _v_e_r_s_i_o_n_ _c_o_n_t_r_o_l, and IT.
  Planning
      Develop the plan bringing together the information on projects,
      resources, timescales, monitoring and control._[_5_]
  Improvement
      Continuously assess performance; research and develop new capabilities;
      and systemically apply learning and knowledge to the program.

The key difference between a program and a project is the finite nature of a
project_[_6_] - a project must always have a specific end date, else it is an
ongoing program.
One view of the differences between a program and a project in business is
that:
   1. A project is unique and is of definite duration. A program is ongoing and
      implemented within a business to consistently achieve certain results for
      the business.
   2. A project is designed to deliver an output or deliverable and its success
      will be in terms of delivering the right output at the right time and to
      the right cost.
   3. Program management includes management of projects which, together,
      improve the performance of the organization. A program's success will be
      measured in terms of benefits.
   4. Benefits are the measures of improvement of an organization and might
      include increased income, increased profits, decreased costs, reduced
      wastage or environmental damage, more satisfied customers. In central or
      local government organizations, benefits might include providing a better
      service to the community.
   5. In the course of achieving required results, business programs will
      normally understand related business constraints and determine the
      processes required to achieve results based on resources allocated.
      Improvement of processes is a continuous operation that very much
      contrasts a program from a project.
   6. At the lowest level project managers co-ordinate individual projects.
      They are overseen by the program manager who accounts to the program
      sponsor (or board).
   7. There will normally be a process to change the predetermined scope of a
      project. Programs often have to react to changes in strategy and changes
      in the environment in which the organization changes.
Another view and another successful way of managing does not see any of the
factors listed above as distinguishing projects from programs, but rather sees
the program as being about portfolio management. On this view, program
management is about selecting projects, adjusting the speed at which they run,
and adjusting their scope, in order to maximize the value of the portfolio as a
whole, and as economic or other external conditions change.
Yet another view is that a program management is nothing more than a large,
complex project, where the integration aspect of project management is more
important than in smaller projects. Integration management is a key feature of
the _P_r_o_j_e_c_t_ _M_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t_ _I_n_s_t_i_t_u_t_e's approach to project management.
In practice it is not clear that there is such a clear-cut distinction.
Projects (or programs) vary from small and simple to large and complex, what
needs to be a managed as a program in one culture or organization may be
managed as a project in another.
