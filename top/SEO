SSeeaarrcchh eennggiinnee ooppttiimmiizzaattiioonn (SSEEOO) is the process of improving the visibility of
a _w_e_b_s_i_t_e or a _w_e_b_ _p_a_g_e in a _s_e_a_r_c_h_ _e_n_g_i_n_e's "natural" or un-paid ("_o_r_g_a_n_i_c")
_s_e_a_r_c_h_ _r_e_s_u_l_t_s. In general, the earlier (or higher ranked on the search results
page), and more frequently a site appears in the search results list, the more
visitors it will receive from the search engine's users. SEO may target
different kinds of search, including _i_m_a_g_e_ _s_e_a_r_c_h, _l_o_c_a_l_ _s_e_a_r_c_h, _v_i_d_e_o_ _s_e_a_r_c_h,
_a_c_a_d_e_m_i_c_ _s_e_a_r_c_h,_[_1_] news search and industry-specific _v_e_r_t_i_c_a_l_ _s_e_a_r_c_h engines.
As an _I_n_t_e_r_n_e_t_ _m_a_r_k_e_t_i_n_g strategy, SEO considers how search engines work, what
people search for, the actual search terms or keywords typed into search
engines and which search engines are preferred by their targeted audience.
Optimizing a website may involve editing its content, _H_T_M_L and associated
coding to both increase its relevance to specific keywords and to remove
barriers to the _i_n_d_e_x_i_n_g_ _a_c_t_i_v_i_t_i_e_s of search engines. Promoting a site to
increase the number of _b_a_c_k_l_i_n_k_s, or inbound links, is another SEO tactic.
The plural of the abbreviation SEO can also refer to "search engine
optimizers," those who provide SEO services.

_W_e_b_m_a_s_t_e_r_s and content providers began optimizing sites for search engines in
the mid-1990s, as the first search engines were cataloging the early _W_e_b.
Initially, all webmasters needed to do was to submit the address of a page, or
_U_R_L, to the various engines which would send a "_s_p_i_d_e_r" to "crawl" that page,
extract links to other pages from it, and return information found on the page
to be _i_n_d_e_x_e_d._[_2_] The process involves a search engine spider downloading a
page and storing it on the search engine's own server, where a second program,
known as an _i_n_d_e_x_e_r, extracts various information about the page, such as the
words it contains and where these are located, as well as any weight for
specific words, and all links the page contains, which are then placed into a
scheduler for crawling at a later date.
Site owners started to recognize the value of having their sites highly ranked
and visible in search engine results, creating an opportunity for both _w_h_i_t_e
_h_a_t and _b_l_a_c_k_ _h_a_t SEO practitioners. According to industry analyst _D_a_n_n_y
_S_u_l_l_i_v_a_n, the phrase "search engine optimization" probably came into use in
1997._[_3_] The first documented use of the term Search Engine Optimization was
John Audette and his company Multimedia Marketing Group as documented by a web
page from the MMG site from August, 1997._[_4_]
Early versions of search _a_l_g_o_r_i_t_h_m_s relied on webmaster-provided information
such as the keyword _m_e_t_a_ _t_a_g, or index files in engines like _A_L_I_W_E_B. Meta tags
provide a guide to each page's content. Using meta data to index pages was
found to be less than reliable, however, because the webmaster's choice of
keywords in the meta tag could potentially be an inaccurate representation of
the site's actual content. Inaccurate, incomplete, and inconsistent data in
meta tags could and did cause pages to rank for irrelevant searches._[_5_][_d_u_b_i_o_u_s
โ _d_i_s_c_u_s_s] Web content providers also manipulated a number of attributes
within the HTML source of a page in an attempt to rank well in search engines.
_[_6_]
By relying so much on factors such as _k_e_y_w_o_r_d_ _d_e_n_s_i_t_y which were exclusively
within a webmaster's control, early search engines suffered from abuse and
ranking manipulation. To provide better results to their users, search engines
had to adapt to ensure their _r_e_s_u_l_t_s_ _p_a_g_e_s showed the most relevant search
results, rather than unrelated pages stuffed with numerous keywords by
unscrupulous webmasters. Since the success and popularity of a search engine is
determined by its ability to produce the most relevant results to any given
search, allowing those results to be false would turn users to find other
search sources. Search engines responded by developing more complex ranking
algorithms, taking into account additional factors that were more difficult for
webmasters to manipulate. Graduate students at _S_t_a_n_f_o_r_d_ _U_n_i_v_e_r_s_i_t_y, _L_a_r_r_y_ _P_a_g_e
and _S_e_r_g_e_y_ _B_r_i_n, developed "Backrub," a search engine that relied on a
mathematical algorithm to rate the prominence of web pages. The number
calculated by the algorithm, _P_a_g_e_R_a_n_k, is a function of the quantity and
strength of _i_n_b_o_u_n_d_ _l_i_n_k_s._[_7_] PageRank estimates the likelihood that a given
page will be reached by a web user who randomly surfs the web, and follows
links from one page to another. In effect, this means that some links are
stronger than others, as a higher PageRank page is more likely to be reached by
the random surfer.
Page and Brin founded _G_o_o_g_l_e in 1998. Google attracted a loyal following among
the growing number of _I_n_t_e_r_n_e_t users, who liked its simple design._[_8_] Off-page
factors (such as PageRank and hyperlink analysis) were considered as well as
on-page factors (such as keyword frequency, _m_e_t_a_ _t_a_g_s, headings, links and site
structure) to enable Google to avoid the kind of manipulation seen in search
engines that only considered on-page factors for their rankings. Although
PageRank was more difficult to game, webmasters had already developed link
building tools and schemes to influence the _I_n_k_t_o_m_i search engine, and these
methods proved similarly applicable to gaming PageRank. Many sites focused on
exchanging, buying, and selling links, often on a massive scale. Some of these
schemes, or _l_i_n_k_ _f_a_r_m_s, involved the creation of thousands of sites for the
sole purpose of _l_i_n_k_ _s_p_a_m_m_i_n_g._[_9_]
By 2004, search engines had incorporated a wide range of undisclosed factors in
their ranking algorithms to reduce the impact of link manipulation. In June
2007, The New York Times' Saul Hansell stated Google ranks sites using more
than 200 different signals._[_1_0_] The leading search engines, _G_o_o_g_l_e, _B_i_n_g, and
_Y_a_h_o_o, do not disclose the algorithms they use to rank pages. Some SEO
practitioners have studied different approaches to search engine optimization,
and have shared their personal opinions_[_1_1_] Patents related to search engines
can provide information to better understand search engines._[_1_2_]
In 2005, Google began personalizing search results for each user. Depending on
their history of previous searches, Google crafted results for logged in users.
_[_1_3_] In 2008, Bruce Clay said that "ranking is dead" because of _p_e_r_s_o_n_a_l_i_z_e_d
_s_e_a_r_c_h. He opined that it would become meaningless to discuss how a website
ranked, because its rank would potentially be different for each user and each
search._[_1_4_]
In 2007, Google announced a campaign against paid links that transfer PageRank.
_[_1_5_] On June 15, 2009, Google disclosed that they had taken measures to
mitigate the effects of PageRank sculpting by use of the _n_o_f_o_l_l_o_w attribute on
links. _M_a_t_t_ _C_u_t_t_s, a well-known software engineer at Google, announced that
Google Bot would no longer treat nofollowed links in the same way, in order to
prevent SEO service providers from using nofollow for PageRank sculpting._[_1_6_]
As a result of this change the usage of nofollow leads to evaporation of
pagerank. In order to avoid the above, SEO engineers developed alternative
techniques that replace nofollowed tags with obfuscated _J_a_v_a_s_c_r_i_p_t and thus
permit PageRank sculpting. Additionally several solutions have been suggested
that include the usage of _i_f_r_a_m_e_s, _F_l_a_s_h and Javascript._[_1_7_]
In December 2009, Google announced it would be using the web search history of
all its users in order to populate search results._[_1_8_]
_G_o_o_g_l_e_ _I_n_s_t_a_n_t, real-time-search, was introduced in late 2010 in an attempt to
make search results more timely and relevant. Historically site administrators
have spent months or even years optimizing a website to increase search
rankings. With the growth in popularity of social media sites and blogs the
leading engines made changes to their algorithms to allow fresh content to rank
quickly within the search results._[_1_9_]
In February 2011, Google announced the _P_a_n_d_a update, which penalizes websites
containing content duplicated from other websites and sources. Historically
websites have copied content from one another and benefited in search engine
rankings by engaging in this practice, however Google implemented a new system
which punishes sites whose content is not unique._[_2_0_]
In April 2012, Google launched the _G_o_o_g_l_e_ _P_e_n_g_u_i_n update the goal of which was
to penalise websites that used manipulative techniques to improve their
rankings on the search engine._[_2_1_]

Yahoo and Google offices
By 1997, search engines recognized that _w_e_b_m_a_s_t_e_r_s were making efforts to rank
well in their search engines, and that some webmasters were even _m_a_n_i_p_u_l_a_t_i_n_g
_t_h_e_i_r_ _r_a_n_k_i_n_g_s in search results by stuffing pages with excessive or irrelevant
keywords. Early search engines, such as _A_l_t_a_v_i_s_t_a and _I_n_f_o_s_e_e_k, adjusted their
algorithms in an effort to prevent webmasters from manipulating rankings._[_2_2_]
In 2005, an annual conference, AIRWeb, Adversarial Information Retrieval on the
Web was created to bring together practitioners and researchers concerned with
search engine optimisation and related topics._[_2_3_]
Companies that employ overly aggressive techniques can get their client
websites banned from the search results. In 2005, the _W_a_l_l_ _S_t_r_e_e_t_ _J_o_u_r_n_a_l
reported on a company, _T_r_a_f_f_i_c_ _P_o_w_e_r, which allegedly used high-risk techniques
and failed to disclose those risks to its clients._[_2_4_] _W_i_r_e_d magazine reported
that the same company sued blogger and SEO Aaron Wall for writing about the
ban._[_2_5_] Google's _M_a_t_t_ _C_u_t_t_s later confirmed that Google did in fact ban
Traffic Power and some of its clients._[_2_6_]
Some search engines have also reached out to the SEO industry, and are frequent
sponsors and guests at SEO conferences, chats, and seminars. Major search
engines provide information and guidelines to help with site optimization._[_2_7_]
_[_2_8_] Google has a _S_i_t_e_m_a_p_s program to help webmasters learn if Google is having
any problems indexing their website and also provides data on Google traffic to
the website._[_2_9_] _B_i_n_g_ _W_e_b_m_a_s_t_e_r_ _T_o_o_l_s provides a way for webmasters to submit a

The leading search engines, such as _G_o_o_g_l_e, _B_i_n_g and _Y_a_h_o_o_!, use software known
as _c_r_a_w_l_e_r_s to discover web pages for their algorithmic search results. Pages
that are linked from other search engine indexed pages do not need to be
submitted because they are found automatically. Some search engines, notably
Yahoo!, operate a paid submission service that guarantee a sites listing for
either a set fee or _p_a_y_-_p_e_r_-_c_l_i_c_k also referred to as cost per click._[_3_0_] Such
programs usually guarantee inclusion in the database, but do not guarantee
specific ranking within the search results._[_3_1_] Two major directories, the
Yahoo Directory and the _O_p_e_n_ _D_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y_ _P_r_o_j_e_c_t both require manual submission

an XML _S_i_t_e_m_a_p feed can be created and submitted for free to ensure that all

_S_e_a_r_c_h_ _e_n_g_i_n_e crawlers may look at a number of different factors when _c_r_a_w_l_i_n_g
a site. Not every page is indexed by the search engines. Distance of pages from
the root directory of a site may also be a factor in whether or not pages get
crawled._[_3_4_]

To prevent certain pages from appearing in the search indexes, webmasters can
instruct spiders not to crawl certain files or directories through the standard
_r_o_b_o_t_s_._t_x_t file in the root directory of the domain. Additionally, a page can
be explicitly excluded from a search engine's database by using a _m_e_t_a_ _t_a_g
specific to robots. When a search engine visits a site, the robots.txt located
in the _r_o_o_t_ _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y is the first file crawled. The robots.txt file is then
parsed, and will instruct the robot as to which pages are not to be crawled. As
a search engine crawler may keep a cached copy of this file, it may on occasion
crawl pages a webmaster does not wish crawled. Pages typically prevented from
being crawled include login specific pages such as shopping carts and user-
specific content such as search results from internal searches. In March 2007,
Google warned webmasters that they should prevent indexing of internal search
results because those pages are considered search spam._[_3_5_]

SEO techniques can be classified into two broad categories: techniques that
search engines recommend as part of good design, and those techniques of which
search engines do not approve. The search engines attempt to minimize the
effect of the latter, among them _s_p_a_m_d_e_x_i_n_g. Industry commentators have
classified these methods, and the practitioners who employ them, as either
_w_h_i_t_e_ _h_a_t SEO, or _b_l_a_c_k_ _h_a_t SEO._[_3_8_] White hats tend to produce results that
last a long time, whereas black hats anticipate that their sites may eventually
be banned either temporarily or permanently once the search engines discover
what they are doing._[_3_9_]
An SEO technique is considered white hat if it conforms to the search engines'
guidelines and involves no deception. As the search engine guidelines_[_2_7_]_[_2_8_]
_[_4_0_] are not written as a series of rules or commandments, this is an important
distinction to note. White hat SEO is not just about following guidelines, but
is about ensuring that the content a search engine indexes and subsequently
ranks is the same content a user will see. White hat advice is generally summed
up as creating content for users, not for search engines, and then making that
content easily accessible to the spiders, rather than attempting to trick the
algorithm from its intended purpose. White hat SEO is in many ways similar to
web development that promotes accessibility,_[_4_1_] although the two are not
identical.
_B_l_a_c_k_ _h_a_t_ _S_E_O attempts to improve rankings in ways that are disapproved of by
the search engines, or involve deception. One black hat technique uses text
that is hidden, either as text colored similar to the background, in an
invisible _d_i_v, or positioned off screen. Another method gives a different page
depending on whether the page is being requested by a human visitor or a search
engine, a technique known as _c_l_o_a_k_i_n_g.
Search engines may penalize sites they discover using black hat methods, either
by reducing their rankings or eliminating their listings from their databases
altogether. Such penalties can be applied either automatically by the search
engines' algorithms, or by a manual site review. One example was the February
2006 Google removal of both _B_M_W Germany and _R_i_c_o_h Germany for use of deceptive
practices._[_4_2_] Both companies, however, quickly apologized, fixed the offending
pages, and were restored to Google's list._[_4_3_]

SEO is not an appropriate strategy for every website, and other Internet
marketing strategies can be more effective like paid advertising through PPC
campaigns, depending on the site operator's goals._[_4_4_] A successful Internet
marketing campaign may also depend upon building high quality web pages to
engage and persuade, setting up _a_n_a_l_y_t_i_c_s programs to enable site owners to
measure results, and improving a site's _c_o_n_v_e_r_s_i_o_n_ _r_a_t_e._[_4_5_]
SEO may generate an adequate _r_e_t_u_r_n_ _o_n_ _i_n_v_e_s_t_m_e_n_t. However, search engines are
not paid for organic search traffic, their algorithms change, and there are no
guarantees of continued referrals. Due to this lack of guarantees and
certainty, a business that relies heavily on search engine traffic can suffer
major losses if the search engines stop sending visitors._[_4_6_] Search engines
can change their algorithms, impacting a website's placement, possibly
resulting in a serious loss of traffic. According to Google's CEO, Eric
Schmidt, in 2010, Google made over 500 algorithm changes โ almost 1.5 per
day._[_4_7_] It is considered wise business practice for website operators to
liberate themselves from dependence on search engine traffic._[_4_8_]

Optimization techniques are highly tuned to the dominant search engines in the
target market. The search engines' market shares vary from market to market, as
does competition. In 2003, _D_a_n_n_y_ _S_u_l_l_i_v_a_n stated that Google represented about
75% of all searches._[_4_9_] In markets outside the United States, Google's share
is often larger, and Google remains the dominant search engine worldwide as of
2007._[_5_0_] As of 2006, Google had an 85โ90% market share in Germany._[_5_1_] While
there were hundreds of SEO firms in the US at that time, there were only about
five in Germany._[_5_1_] As of June 2008, the marketshare of Google in the UK was
close to 90% according to _H_i_t_w_i_s_e._[_5_2_] That market share is achieved in a
number of countries.
As of 2009, there are only a few large markets where Google is not the leading
search engine. In most cases, when Google is not leading in a given market, it
is lagging behind a local player. The most notable example markets are China,
Japan, South Korea, Russia and the Czech Republic where respectively _B_a_i_d_u,
_Y_a_h_o_o_!_ _J_a_p_a_n, _N_a_v_e_r, _Y_a_n_d_e_x and _S_e_z_n_a_m are market leaders.
Successful search optimization for international markets may require
professional _t_r_a_n_s_l_a_t_i_o_n of web pages, registration of a domain name with a _t_o_p
_l_e_v_e_l_ _d_o_m_a_i_n in the target market, and _w_e_b_ _h_o_s_t_i_n_g that provides a local _I_P
_a_d_d_r_e_s_s. Otherwise, the fundamental elements of search optimization are
essentially the same, regardless of language._[_5_1_]

On October 17, 2002, SearchKing filed suit in the United States District Court,
Western District of Oklahoma, against the search engine Google. SearchKing's
claim was that Google's tactics to prevent _s_p_a_m_d_e_x_i_n_g constituted a _t_o_r_t_i_o_u_s
_i_n_t_e_r_f_e_r_e_n_c_e with contractual relations. On May 27, 2003, the court granted
Google's motion to dismiss the complaint because SearchKing "failed to state a
claim upon which relief may be granted."_[_5_3_]_[_5_4_]
In March 2006, _K_i_n_d_e_r_S_t_a_r_t filed a lawsuit against _G_o_o_g_l_e over search engine
rankings. Kinderstart's website was removed from Google's index prior to the
lawsuit and the amount of traffic to the site dropped by 70%. On March 16, 2007
